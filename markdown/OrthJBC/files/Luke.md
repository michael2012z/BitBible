# Luke

## Luke 1

1. Vi-bahlt (since) many Messianic Sofrim have attempted to compile a sefer, a historical narrative, about the momentous events that have been fulfilled among us,

2. just as these [masoret haShluchim] have been handed down to us by those who from HaReshit [of the Besuras HaGeulah] were edei re'iyah (eyewitnesses) and mesharetim [ministers] of the Dvar Hashem,

3. I thought it expeditous also, having done an iyun, accurately and carefully being meayen in every source and and making a medakdeke investigation of every aspect from HaReshit, to write for you and to mesader (arrange, place in order or succession) an orderly account, most noble Theophilus,

4. that you may have da'as of HaEmes regarding the Divrei Moshiach about which you took shiurim (lessons).
 THE HULEDET OF KOHEN-NAVI YOCHANAN OF THE TEVILAH OF TESHUVA FORETOLD

5. At the time of Herod king of Yehudah, there was an a certain kohen by the name Zecharyah, who belonged to the Aviyah division.  His isha was of the banot Aharon and her name was Elisheva. [Divrey Hayamim Alef 24:10]

6. And they were both tzaddikim before Hashem, walking a derech tamim in all the mitzvot and chukim of the Torah of Adoneinu. [Bereshis 6:9; Devarim 5:33; Melachim Alef 9:4]

7. But they had no ben, because Elisheva was barren, and they were both advanced in their yamim.

8. And it came to pass in the performance of his avodas kodesh sherut as a kohen before Hashem in the appointed order of his division, [Divrey Hayamim Alef 24:19; Divrey Hayamim Bais 8:14]

9. according to the minhag (custom) of the kehunah, Zecharyah was chosen by lot to enter the Beis Hamikdash and to offer ketoket (incense). [Shemot 30:7,8; Divrey Hayamim Alef 23:13; Divrey Hayamim Bais 29:11; Tehillim 141:2]

10. And when the hour of the offering ot the ketoket came, all the multitude were davening outside. [Vayikra 16:17]

11. And there appeared to Zecharyah a malach Hashem, standing on the right side of the Mitzbe'ach of ketoret. [Shemot 30:1-10]

12. And, seeing the malach, Zecharyah was terrified, and pachad (fear) fell on him. [Shofetim 6:22,23; 13:22]

13. But the malach said to him, "Do not have pachad, Zecharyah. Your tefillah was heard and your isha, Elisheva, will bear a ben to you and you will call his shem Yochanan.

14. "And he will be a simcha to you and sasson, and there will be sasson rav at his huledet.

15. "And he will be gadol before Hashem, and he will not drink yayin or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Ruach Hakodesh from the womb of his em (mother), [Bamidbar 6:3; Vayikra 10:9; Shofetim 13:4; Yirmeyah 1:5]

16. "and many of the Bnei Yisroel he will turn back in teshuva to Hashem Eloheihem.

17. "And he will go forth before Adonoi in the Ruach and Ko'ach of Eliyahu, "VEHESHIV LEV AVOT AL BANIM" ("And he will turn the heart of the fathers to the children" Malachi 3:24 [4:6]) and those without mishma'at (obedience) to the chochmah of the tzaddikim to prepare for Adonoi an Am (People) having been made ready." [Malachi 4:5,6]

18. And Zecharyah said to the malach, "Just how will I have da'as that this is so? For I am old and my isha is advanced in her yamim." [Bereshis 15:8; 17:17]

19. And in reply, the malach said to Zecharyah, "I am Gavri'el, I stand before Hashem. And I was sent to speak to you and to announce these things to you. [Daniel 8:16; 9:21]

20. "And --hinei!--, you will be ilem (mute) and not be able to speak, until the yom when these things come to pass, because you did not have emunah in my dvarim, which will be fulfilled in their time." [Shemot 4:11; Yechezkel 3:26]

21. And the people were expecting Zecharyah and they were bewildered at his delay in the Beis HaMikdash.

22. And when he came out, he was ilem (mute) and not able to speak to them, and they had da'as that he had seen a chazon (vision) in the Heikhal. He kept motioning to them and he remained ilem.

23. And it came about as the yamim of his sherut as a kohen were fulfilled, he went to his bais.

24. And after these yamim, Elisheva, his isha, became "with child," and she kept herself in seclusion for chamesh chodashim, saying,

25. "Hashem has done this for me.  In these yamim he looked with Chen V'Chesed on me to take away my reproach among bnei Adam." [Bereshis 30:23; Yeshayah 4:1] 
 THE HULEDET OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH FORETOLD (1:26-38)

26. Now in the chodesh shishi the malach Gavri'el was sent from Hashem to a shtetl in the Galil called Natzeret,

27. to a betulah given in erusin (betrothal, engagement) to an ish from the Beit Dovid named Yosef, and the shem of the betulah was Miryam.

28. And when the malach approached her, he said, "Shalom, favored one! Hashem is with you!"

29. But she was greatly perplexed at the message, and kept pondering what sort of Shalom greeting this might be.

30. And the malach said to her, "Do not have pachad, Miryam, for you have found chen before Hashem. [Bereshis 6:8]

31. "And--hinei--in your womb you will conceive and bear BEN [Yeshayah 7:14] and you will call SHMO Yehoshua. [Zecharyah 6:11-12]

32. "He will be gadol and will be called Ben HaElyon.  Adonoi Elohim will give him the kisse Dovid Aviv,

33. "and he will rule over the Beis Yakov l'Olam va'ed, and his Malchut will never come to an end." [Shmuel Bais 7:16; Tehillim 89:3,4; Yeshayah 9:7; Yirmeyah 33:17; Daniel 2:44; 7:14,27; Michoh 4:7]

34. But Miryam said to the malach, "How will be this, vi-bahlt (since) I do not have da'as of an ish?"

35. And in reply, the malach said to her, "The Ruach Hakodesh will come upon you and the gevurah of HaElyon will overshadow you. Therefore, also, the one being born will be called HaKadosh, Ben HaElohim.

36. "And--hinei-- Elisheva your korev (relative) also has conceived a ben in her old age, and this chodesh is hashishi for her who is called barren.

37. "For nothing will be impossible with Hashem."

38. And Miryam said, "Hinei!--I am the shifcha (bond maid) of Hashem.  May it be done to me according to your dvar." And the malach departed from her.  SHIRIM OF ELISHEVA AND MIRYAM (LK 1:39-56)

39. And in those yamim, Miryam got up and traveled into the hill country with haste to a shtetl of Yehudah.

40. And she entered into the bais of Zecharyah and gave Shalom greetings to Elisheva.

41. And it came about, when Elisheva heard the greeting of "Shalom!" of Miryam, the yeled leaped in Elisheva's womb, and Elisheva was filled with the Ruach Hakodesh.

42. And Elisheva cried out with a kol gadol, and said, "Berukhah at miNashim, and Baruch p'ri (fruit) of your womb! [Shofetim 5:24]

43. "And why has this happened to me that the Em Adoni should come to me?

44. "For--hinei!--when the sound of your Shalom greeting came into my ears, the yeled leaped with simcha in my womb.

45. "And ashrey is the one having had emunah that there will be a fulfillment to the things having been spoken to Miryam by Hashem."

46. And Miryam said, [Tehillim 34:2,3]

47. ALATZ LIBI BAHASHEM ("My heart rejoices in Hashem" Shmuel Alef 2:1) and my neshamah exalts in Hashem Moshi'i (my Savior), [Tehillim 18:46; Yeshayah 17:10; 61:10; Chabakuk 3:18]

48. "For HASHEM VISHAFAL YIREH (Tehillim 138:6), he looked upon the humble state of his shifcha (bond maid) for--hinei-- from now on kol hadorot ishruni ("all generations will call me happy,"-- Bereshis 30:13) [Tehillim 138:6]

49. "for Shaddai (the Almighty) did gedolot for me and Kadosh is Shmo, [Tehillim 111:9]

50. "and the chesed of Hashem is DOR V'DOR [Tehillim 100:5] to those with yirat Shomayim. [Shemot 20:6; Tehillim 103:17]

51. "Hashem has done nifla'ot with his zero'a [Yeshayah 53:1]. He scattered those who in the machshavot (thoughts) of their levavot are the Ge'im (the Haughty ones). [Tehillim 98:1; Yeshayah 40:10; Bereshis 11:8; Shemot 18:11; Shmuel Bais 22:28; Yirmeyah 13:9; 49:16]

52. "He brought down shalitim (rulers) from their kisot (thrones) and lifted up the Anavim,

53. "the ones hungering Hashem made mile tov and the ashirim he sent away empty. [Tehillim 107:9]

54. "Hashem helped his servant Yisroel, in zikaron of his rachamim,  [Tehillim 98:3]

55. "just as Hashem spoke to Avoteinu, to Avraham Avinu and his Zera ad Olam."

56. And Miryam remained with Elisheva about shalosha chodashim, and then Miryam returned to her bais.

 HULEDET AND YOUTH OF YOCHANAN OF THE TEVILAH OF TESHUVA

57. Now when the time of Elisheva to give birth was fulfilled,  she bore a ben.

58. And Elisheva's shcheinim (neighbors) and kroivim (relatives)  heard that Adoneinu greatly demonstrated his rachamim to her and they had much simcha with her.

59. And it came about on the yom hashemini they came for the Bris Milah of the yeled, and they were calling him by the name of  his abba, Zecharyah. [Bereshis 17:12]

60. And in reply, his em (mother) said, "Lo, but he will be called Yochanan."

61. And they said to her, "There is no one from your kroivim who is called by this shem."

62. And they began motioning to the yeled's abba to find out what shem he wanted to give him.

63. And having asked for a luach, Zecharyah wrote, saying, "Yochanan is his shem." And everyone was amazed.

64. And Zecharyah's mouth was loosed at once and the lashon of him, and he began speaking, saying "Baruch Hashem!" [Yechezkel 24:27]

65. And upon all their shcheinim came much yirat Shomayim, and in the entire mountain country of Yehudah everyone was talking about these matters.

66. All who heard these things pondered them in their levavot, saying, "What then will this yeled become?"  For, indeed, the yad Hashem was with him. [Bereshis 39:2]

67. And Zecharyah, his abba, was filled with the Ruach Hakodesh and brought forth a dvar nevu'ah, saying, [Yoel 2:28]

68. "BARUCH HASHEM ELOHEI YISROEL [Tehillim 41:14 (13)], for Adonoi has visited his Am Berit and accomplished a pedut for the Geulah of them. [Bereshis 24:27; Melachim Alef 8:15; Tehillim 72:18; 111:9]

69. "And Hashem raised up a Keren Yeshu'a, a mighty Moshi'a, for us in the Beis Dovid, his eved, [Shmuel Alef 2:1,10; Shmuel Bais 22:3; Tehillim 18:2; 89:17; 132:17; Yechezkel 29:21]

70. "just as Hashem spoke through the mouth of his nevi'im hakedoshim meOlam, [Yirmeyah 23:5]

71. "that we should have Yeshu'at Eloheinu from our oyvim and from the hand of all the ones who regard us with sin'as chinom.

72. "Thus Hashem has demonstrated his rachamim to Avoteinu and has shown zikaron of his Brit HaKodesh, [Michoh 7:20; Tehillim 105:8,9; 106:45; Yechezkel 16:60]

73. "the Brit HaShevu'ah which he swore to Avraham Avinu to grant us, [Bereshis 22:16-18]

74. "having been delivered from the yad haoyvim to serve Hashem fearlessly,

75. "in Kedusha and tzedek before Him all our yamim.

76. "And you also, yeled, will be called Navi HaElyon; for you will go LIFNEI HAADON to prepare the DERECH HASHEM. [Malachi 3:1; Yeshayah 40:3]

77. "to give da'as of Yeshu'at Eloheinu to Hashem's Am Berit, by their selichat avon [Yirmeyah 31:34]

78. "through the rav rachamim of Eloheinu, by which will visit us the rising SHEMESH [Moshiach] from Shomayim, [Malachi 4:2]

79. "to appear to the ones in CHOSHECH and YOSHVEI B'ERETZ TZALMAVET, to direct our feet into the Derech Shalom."  [Tehillim 107:14; Yeshayah 9:1-2; 59:9]

80. And the yeled was growing and was being given chizzuk in the Ruach Hakodesh, and Yochanan was in the desolate places until the day of his manifestation to Yisroel.

## Luke 2

1. And it came about at that time that a dvar malchut was sent out from Caesar Augustus to register everyone in the entire Roman Empire.

2. This mifkad (census) was before that taken while Quirinius was governor in Syria.

3. And everyone was travellng to register, each to his own shtetl.

4. Now Yosef also went up from the Galil, from the shtetl of Natzeret, to Yehudah, to the Ir Dovid, which is called Beit-Lechem, because he was of the mishpochah and beis of Dovid.

5. And Yosef went up to register with Miryam, who had been given to him in erusin (betrothal) and who was "with child."

6. And it came about, while they were there, the yamim were fulfilled for Miryam to give birth.

7. And she bore her ben, her Bechor; and she wrapped him in cloths, and laid him in an evus (animal feeding trough), because for them there was not a place in the malon (inn).  THE MALACH AND THE RO'IM (SHEPHERDS) (LK 2:8-20)

8. And ro'im were in the same region, living in the open outside, and keeping shomer over their eder (flock) balailah.

9. And a malach Hashem suddenly stood before them, and the kavod  Hashem shone around them; and they were afraid with a yir'ah gedolah.

10. And the malach said to them, "Do not have pachad; for-- hinei --I announce Besuras HaGeulah to you of great simcha which will be for kol Am Berit;

11. "because hayom, in the Ir Dovid, has been born to you a Moshi'a (Savior), who is Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach HaAdon. [Yeshayah 9:5(6)]

12. "And this will be HaOt [The Sign] to you:  you will find an olal (infant) wrapped in cloths and lying in an evus."      [Shmuel Alef 2:34; Melachim Bais 19:29; Tehillim 86:17; Yeshayah 7:14]

13. And suddenly there was with the malach a multitude of the Tz'va HaShomayim praising Hashem, and saying,

14. "Kavod to Hashem bamarom; And on ha'aretz shalom among bnei Adam ratzon."  [Yeshayah 9:6; 52:7; 53:5; Michoh 5:5]

15. And it came about, when the malachim departed from them to Shomayim, the ro'im were saying to one another, "Let us go now up to Bethlehem and let us see this thing that has come about which Hashem has made known to us."

16. And they came in haste and found both Miryam and Yosef and the olal lying in the evus.

17. And when they saw this, they made known the dvar concerning this yeled which had been told them.

18. And all who heard it were amazed about the things which were told them by the ro'im.

19. But Miryam was treasuring up all these things, pondering them in her lev (heart).

20. And the ro'im went back, and as they returned, they cried, `Baruch Hashem" as they gave kavod to G-d for all which they had heard and seen, just as it had been foretold to them. 
 THE BRIS MILAH AND NAMING CEREMONY CONFERRING A HEBREW NAME ON REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH

21. And when shemonah yamim were completed for his Bris Milah, his shem was called Yehoshua, the shem by which he was called by the malach, before he was conceived in the womb. [Zecharyah 6:11-12]  THE PIDYON-HABEN OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH, THE TOHORAH OF MIRYAM, AND THE PRESENTATION IN THE BEIS HAMIKDASH; MASHMIDIM (DEVOTEES) IN THE BEIS HAMIKDASH

22. And when the yamim for their tohorah according to the Torah of Moshe Rabbeinu were completed, they brought him up to Yerushalayim to present him to Hashem [Vayikra 12:2-8]

23. (just as it has been written in the Torat Hashem, "KHOL BECHOR opening the RECHEM KADESH to Hashem" [Shemot 13:2,12,15; Bamidbar 3:13]

24. and to offer a korban according to the thing having been said in the Torat Hashem, "SH'TEI TORIM O SHNEI BENI YONAH (a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons)." [Vayikra 12:8]

25. And--hinei--there was an ish in Yerushalayim whose shem was Shim'on, a tzaddik, a chasid, awaiting the Nechamat Yisroel, and the Ruach Hakodesh was upon him. [Yeshayah 52:9]

26. And it had been revealed to him by the Ruach Hakodesh that he was not to see mavet until he had seen Hashem's Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach.

27. And Shim'on came in the Ruach Hakodesh into the courts of the Beis HaMikdash; and when the horim (parents) brought in the yeled, Yehoshua, to do concerning him the customary mitzva of the Torah,

28. then Shim'on took him into his arms, saying "Baruch Hashem,"  and the following,

29. "And now, Adonoi, dismiss your eved in shalom, according to your dvar;

30. "because my eynayim have beheld the Yeshu'at Eloheinu, [Yeshayah 40:5; 52:10]

31. "which you prepared in the presence of kol ha'ammim,

32. "an Ohr to give hitgalut (revelation) to the Nations and the kavod of your Am, Yisroel."  [Yeshayah 42:6; 49:6]

33. And the av v'em of the yeled were amazed at the things being spoken about him.

34. And Shim'on said a berakhah over them and said to Miryam his em, "Hinei--this one is destined for the michshol (stumbling) and tekumah (revival) of RABBIM [Yeshayah 53:11-12] in Yisroel and for an Ot that will be opposed (against which there will be mitnaggedim, opponents). [Yeshayah 8:14; 53:3]

35. "and a cherev will pierce the neshamah of you yourself also so that the machshavot of many levavot will be revealed." CHANAH THE TZADDEKES (PIOUS AND RIGHTEOUS WOMAN)

36. And there was a ne'viah (prophetess) named Chanah Bat-P'nu'el, of the shevet (tribe) of Asher.  This isha was advanced in age, having lived with her ba'al sheva shanim from her betulim (virginity),

37. and then to the age of eighty-four she had lived as an almanah who was not departing from the Beis HaMikdash, serving yomam valailah with tzomot (fastings) and tefillos.

38. And at that very moment she came and stood nearby, exclaiming, "Baruch Hashem," and she continued speaking about him to all the ones anticipating the Geulah of Yerushalayim. [Yeshayah 40:2; 52:9]

39. And when they had been shomer mitzvot and completed everything according to the Torat Hashem, they returned to the Galil and to their own shtetl of Natzeret.   THE BAL KISHRON REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH, ON THE THRESHOLD OF ADULT LIFE, WITH THE RABBONIM IN THE COURTS OF THE BEIS HAMIKDASH, LIKE A BOCHUR BEING PREPARED FOR HIS ENTRY INTO THE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY, WHICH TOOK PLACE WHEN HE BECAME BAR MITZVAH AT THIRTEEN (P. ABOTH 5:21); REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH THE YESHIVA BOCHUR IN THE BEIS HAMIKDASH, AWARE OF HIS AV SH'BASHOMAYIM

40. And the yeled continued growing and was given chozek (strength), being filled with chochmah, and the Chen v'Chesed Hashem was upon him.

41. And his horim used to make aliyah leregel to Yerushalayim shanah b'shanah for Chag HaPesach (the Feast of Pesach). [Shemot 23:15; Devarim 16:1-8]

42. And when he became a bochur of sheteym esreh shanim, they made aliyah leregel, as usual according to the mitzva and minhag of the Chag;

43. and as they were returning, having fulfilled the prescribed number of yamim, the bochur Yehoshua stayed behind in Yerushalayim.  And his horim did not have da'as of this,

44. but supposed him to be in the caravan, and went a day's journey; and they began looking for him among the kroivim (relatives) and acquaintances.

45. And, not having found him, they returned to Yerushalayim, looking for him.

46. And it came about, that after shelosha yamim they found him in the courts of the Beis HaMikdash, sitting in the midst of the rabbis, both listening to them and asking them she'elot (kashes, questions).

47. And all the ones listening to him where amazed at his binah and at his teshuvot.

48. And when his horim saw him, they were astounded, and his em (mother) said to him, "Beni, why did you do thus to us? Hinei-- your abba and I were anxiously looking for you."

49. And he said to them, "Why is it that you were looking for me? Did you not have da'as that I must be in the Beis Avi?"

50. And they did not have binah (understanding) of the dvar which he spoke to them.

51. And he went down with them, and they came to Natzeret; and he continued in mishma'at to his horim.  And his em (mother) was treasuring all these things in her lev (heart).

52. And Yehoshua kept increasing in chochmah V'GADEL VATOV GAM IM HASHEM V'GAM IM ANASHIM ("and stature and favor with Hashem and men" Shmuel Alef 2:26).

## Luke 3

1. In the shenat chamesh esreh (15th year) of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, while Pontius Pilate was governing Yehudah, when Herod [Antipas] was tetrarch of the Galil, and when Philip the brother of Herod Antipas was tetrarch of Iturea and Trachonitis, and at the same time Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,

2. and when, during the same historical period, Anan and Caiapha were Kohanim Gedolim, then it was that the dvar Hashem came to Yochanan Ben-Zecharyah bamidbar (in the wilderness). THE KOHEN-NAVI YOCHANAN OF THE TEVILAH OF TESHUVA COMES AS REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S MAGGID IN THE MIDBAR (MT. 3:1-12; MK 1:2-8)

3. And Yochanan went into all the surrounding region of the Yarden preaching a tevilah of teshuvah for the selichat avon,

4. as it has been written in the sefer divrei Yeshayah Hanavi, KOL KOREY BAMIDBAR ("A voice of one shouting in the wilderness," YESHAYAH 40:3): `Prepare the Derech Hashem (the Way of the L-rd). Make his paths straight!'"

5. KOL GEY YINNASE V'KHOL HAR V'GEVAH YISHPALU ("Every valley will be filled in and every mountain and hill will be leveled off"), V'HAYAH HE'AKOV LEMISHOR V'HARKHASIM L'VIKAH ("The crooked will be made straight the rough paths made into smooth roads");

6. V'RA'U KHOL BASAR ES YESHU'AT ELOHEINU ("And all basar will see the salvation of our G-d"). [Yeshayah 40:3-5; Tehillim 98:2; Yeshayah 42:16; 52:10]

7. Therefore, Yochanan was saying to the multitudes coming out to have the tevilah supervised by him, "You yeladim of nachashim,  who warned you to flee from the charon af [Hashem] habah (the coming burning wrath of Hashem)?

8. "Therefore, produce p'ri tov l'teshuva (fruit worthy of repentance), and do not begin to presume within yourselves, saying, `We have the zechut Avot (merit of the Fathers) of Avraham Avinu,' for, I say to you, that Hashem is able from these avanim (stones) to raise up banim to Avraham Avinu.  [Yeshayah 51:2]

9. "And already the ax is laid at the shoresh haAitzim (the root of the trees).  Therefore, every aitz not producing p'ri tov is cut down and is thrown into the Aish."

10. And the multitudes were questioning him, saying, "What then should we do?"

11. And in reply, Yochanan was saying to them, "Let the one having two kaftans share with the one having none, and let the one having okhel do likewise."  [Yeshayah 58:7; Yechezkel 18:7]

12. Now came also mochesim (tax-collectors) to receive the tevilah of teshuva, and they said to him, "Rabbi, what should we do?"

13. And Yochanan said to them, "Collect nothing more than the amount having been commanded you."

14. And also chaiyalim (soldiers) were asking him, "What should we do also?" And Yochanan said to them, "Extort kesef from no one, and let there be no lashon hora (slander). And be satisfied with your gehalt (wages)." [Yechezkel 23:1; Vayikra 19:11]

15. As the Am [Berit] were filled with expectation, all wondering in their levavot concerning Yochanan, whether perhaps he might be the Moshiach,

16. Yochanan answered everyone, saying, "I give you a tevilah with a mikveh mayim, but Hu HaBa (Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach) has more ko'ach (power) than me; I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals.  He will give you a tevilah with the Ruach Hakodesh and with aish.

17. "The winnowing fork is in his hand to clean out his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but the MOTZ ("chaff," Tehillim 1:4) he will burn up with an AISH LO TIKHBEH (fire not [ever] extinguished--Yeshayah 66:24). [Yeshayah 30:24; Ruth 3:2]

18. Therefore, with many other dvarim Yochanan was exhorting them, preaching the Besuras HaGeulah to the Am [Berit]. 





 FINAL YAMIM OF THE AVODAS KODESH MINISTRY OF THE KOHEN-NAVI YOCHANAN (JO 4:1-3)

19. Now Herod the tetrarch, when he was reproved by Yochanan about Herodias, the wife of his brother, and about all the resha'im which he did,

20. Herod added this also on top of everything else: he locked up Yochanan in the beit hasohar (prison).



 REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S TEVILAH IN THE MIKVEH MAYIM OF THE YARDEN RIVER  (MT.3:13-17; MK 1:9-11)

21. And it came about while all the Am [Berit] were receiving the tevilah, and when Yehoshua also had been given the tevilah and was davening, Shomayim was opened,

22. and the Ruach Hakodesh descended in demut gashmit as a yonah upon Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach; and then came a Bat Kol out of Shomayim, saying, "ATAH BNI AHUVI ASHER B'CHA CHAFATSTI ("You are my Son, the beloved one, with you I am well pleased." [Bereshis 22:2; Yeshayah 42:1; Tehillim 2:7] TOLDOT OF REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH  (Mt.1:1-17)

23. And Yehoshua himself was about shaloshim shanah, at the beginning of his avodas kodesh ministry,  being the ben, as it was being thought, of Yosef ben Eli,

## Luke 4

1. Now Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, full of the Ruach Hakodesh, returned from the Yarden, and was being led by the Ruach Hakodesh bamidbar [Yechezkel 37:1]

2. where for ARBA'IM YOM Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was being tempted by Hasatan. And he had no okhel in those yamim.  And when the yamim had been completed, he was famished. [Shemot 34:28]

3. And Hasatan said to Rebbe Melech Melech HaMoshiach, "If you are the Ben HaElohim, command this even (stone) that it become lechem."

4. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach answered Hasatan, "It has been written, LO 'AL HALECHEM L'VADOH Y'CHE-YEH HAADAM, ("Not by bread alone will man live." [Devarim 8:3])

5. And Hasatan led Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach up and showed him, in a moment of time, all the mamlakhut (kingdoms) of the Olam Hazeh;

6. and Hasatan said to Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, "To you I will give all this shilton and their kavod, because it has been given to me; and to whomever I desire, I give it.

7. "Therefore, if you will KOREI'A U'MISHTACHAVEH ("bow down and worship," ESTHER 3:5) before me, everything will be yours."

8. And in reply, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to Hasatan, "It has been written, ES HASHEM ELOHEICHA TIRAH V'OTO TA'AVOD ("Es Hashem Eloheicha you shall fear and him alone you shall serve." Devarim 6:13)

9. And Hasatan led Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach to Yerushalayim and set him atop the pinnacle of the Beis HaMikdash, and said to him, "If you are the Ben HaElohim, throw yourself down from here;

10. For it has been written, MALACHAV Y'TZAV-VEH LACH ("His angels he will command concerning you" to protect you,

11. "and upon their hands they will lift you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone."  [Tehillim 91:11,12]

12. And in reply, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to Hasatan, "It is said, LO TENASSU ES HASHEM ELOHEICHEM, ("Do not put to the test Hashem your G-d." [Devarim 6:16]

13. And after Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach completed all nisayonot, Hasatan went away from him until an opportune time. REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH RETURNS TO THE GALIL  (MT. 4:12; MK 1:14; JO 4:43-45)

14. And in the ko'ach of the Ruach Hakodesh, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach returned to the Galil. And a report went out throughout all the surrounding countryside about him.    GO'ALEINU ADONOI TZ'VA'OT SHMO KEDOSH YISROEL! REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH CALLED UP TO READ AT THE ALMEMAR (RAISED PLATFORM) AS THE BA'AL KORAY OF THE HAFTARAH (MT.4:17; MK 1:15)

15. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was saying shiurim in their shuls and eliciting a peledike reaction from everyone.

16. And he came to Natzeret, the shtetl of his guddal (being brought up) and he entered according to his minhag on Yom haShabbos into the shul and was given an aliyah as the Ba'al Koray.

17. And at the Hagba, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was presented with the megillat sefer Yeshayah, and having unrolled the megillah, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach found the dvar where it had been written,

18. RUACH ADONAI ELOHIM ALAI YA'AN MASHACH ADONAI OTI LEVASER ANAVIM SHELACHANI LIKRO LISHVUYIM DEROR, and to the blind PEKACH KO'ACH, L'SHLEI'ACH RETZUTZIM CHAFSHIM, ("The Spirit of the Sovereign L-rd is upon me because he anointed me to preach Besuras HaGeulah to the poor, he has sent me to preach to the captives release and to the blind the recovery of sight, to set the oppressed free [Yeshayah 61:1-2; 58:6],

19. LIKRO SHENAT RATZON LAHASHEM ("To preach the year of Hashem's favor.")[Yeshayah 61:1,2 Targum Ha-Shivim; Vayikra 25:10; Tehillim 102:20, 103:6; Yeshayah 42:7,49:8,9]

20. And doing the gelilah ceremony, he rolled up the megillah; and, having given it back to the shammash, he sat down [to teach]. And all the eyes in the shul were focused on him.

21. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach began to speak to them, "Hayom (today) this dvar of the Kitvei Hakodesh has been fulfilled in your hearing."

22. And everyone was speaking well of him and they were amazed at the divrei Chen coming out of his mouth and they were saying, "Can this be Yosef's ben?"

23. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Muz zain (no doubt) you will speak this mashal to me: `Rofeh, heal yourself.` Everything  we heard that happened in K'far-Nachum, do also here in your shtetl."

24. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Omein, I say to you that no navi is welcome in his own shtetl, in his own eretz moledet (homeland).

25. "Omein I tell you, there were many almanot in Yisroel in the yamim of Eliyahu HaNavi, when Shomayim was shut up for shalosh shanim and shishah chodashim, when a great famine occurred over all the land, [Melachim Alef 17:1]

26. "And to not one of them was Eliyahu HaNavi sent except to Tzarfat of Tzidon to an isha, an almanah.  [Melachim Alef 17:8-16]

27. And many metzora'im (lepers) were in Yisroel during the time of Elisha HaNavi, and not one of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian."  [Melachim Bais 5:1-14]

28. And hearing these things, all in the shul were filled with ka'as.

29. And they got up and drove Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach outside the shtetl; and they led him up to the top of the hill upon which the shtetl had been built, and they were intending to throw him down. [Bamidbar 15:35]

30. But having gone through the midst of them, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was walking away.

31. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went down to K'far-Nachum, a shtetl of the Galil. And he was saying them shiurim on the Shabbatot.  SHABBOS IN KFAR-NACHUM  (MT 8:14-17; MK 1:21-34)

32. And they were amazed at his torah, because Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach's dvar torah was with samchut.

33. And in the shul there was a man having a ruach hatameh (unclean spirit, shed, demon) and he cried out with a kol gadol.

34. "Ah, mah lanu v'lach, Yehoshua of Natzeret? Did you come to destroy us? I have da'as of who you are, HaKadosh of Hashem."

35. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach rebuked him saying, "Sha! Shekit! And come out of him!"  And right in front of them, when the shed threw him down, the ruach hatameh came out of him and did not do him any harm.

36. And astonishment came upon everyone.  And they were talking to one another saying, "What is this dvar Torah, for with samchut and ko'ach he commands the ruchot hatemei'ot (unclean spirits) and they come out!

37. And a shema (report) was going out about him into every place of the surrounding region.

38. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach got up from the shul and  entered into the bais of Shimon. And the chamot (mother-in-law, shviger) of Shimon was fever-stricken, and they asked him about her.

39. And having stood over her, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach rebuked the kaddachat (fever, DEVARIM 28:22) and it left her. And at once, having got up, she was functioning as their mesharetet (servant, keli kodesh, minister).

40. And while the shemesh was setting, all who had cholim, all with various machalot brought them to Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach.  And he, laying his hands upon each one of them, was administering refu'ah to them.

41. And also shedim were coming out from many, shrieking a shrai (scream) and crying out, "You are HaBen HaElohim!" And rebuklng them, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was not allowing them to speak, because they had da'as of his identity as Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach.    REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH MAKES HIS FIRST ITINERARY THROUGH THE GALIL (MT 4:23-25; MK 1:35-39)

42. And in the boker, having gone forth, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach went out to a desolate place. And the multitudes were seeking him, and when they got to him, they wanted to prevent his departure from them.

43. But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "It is necessary for me to preach the Malchut Hashem in the other shtetlach, because for this purpose I was sent."

44. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was preaching in the shuls of Yehudah.

## Luke 5

1. Now it came about that while the multitude was listening to the dvar Hashem and pressing in upon Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, he had been standing beside Lake Kinneret,

2. and he saw two sirot (boats) having been beside the lake. But the daiyagim had left them and were cleaning the nets.

3. And embarking into one of the sirot (boats), which was Shimon's, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach asked Shimon to put out from the land a little; and having sat down, from the sirah (boat) Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was teaching Torah to the multitudes.

4. And when he stopped speaking, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to Shimon, "Put out into the deep (water) and let down your nets for a catch."

5. And in reply, Shimon said, "Adoni, throughout the whole lailah we have labored and caught nothing, but on account of your dvar I will let down the nets."

6. And having done this, they enclosed asach (a lot of) dagim, and their nets were being torn.

7. And they signaled for their chaverim (partners) in the other sirah (boat) to come and help them. And they came and they filled both sirot (boats) so much that they began to sink.

8. And having seen this, Shimon Kefa fell down before Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, saying, "Depart from me, Adoni, for an ish choteh (sinful man) am I."  [Bereshis 18:27; Iyov 42:6; Yeshayah 6:5]

9. For astonishment seized Shimon Kefa and all the ones with him on account of the catch of dagim (fish) which they took;

10. and likewise also Ya'akov and Yochanan the banim of Zavdai, who were business shuttafim (partners) with Shimon. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to Shimon, "Do not be afraid. From now on you will catch bnei Adam."

11. And having left behind the sirot (boats) on the shore, they forsook all and followed him [as talmidim]. REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S REFU'AH OF THE ISH METZORAH   (MT 8:2-4; MK 1:40-45)

12. And it came about, while he was in one of the shtetlach --hinei!--there was an ish metzorah (a leper) full of leprosy. And having seen Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, having fallen on his face, he begged him saying, "Adoni, if you are willing, you are able to make me tahor."

13. And having stretched out his hand, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach touched him, saying, "I am willing.  Be made tahor."  And, ofen ort (immediately), the leprosy departed from him.

14. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gave orders to him to tell no one, but "Go and show yourself to the kohen and make a korban for your tohorah as Moshe Rabbeinu gave mitzva; do this for an edut (solemn testimony) to them." [Vayikra 14:2-32]

15. But the man was spreading even more the dvar about Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and many multitudes were assembling to listen and to receive refu'ah from their machalot.  REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH REJECTED (YESHAYAH 53:3; MT 4:13-16); REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH GIVES REFU'AH TO A PARALYTIC IN KFAR-NACHUM (MT. 9:1-8; MK 2:1-12; LK 5:17-26)

16. But he was withdrawing in the wilderness places and was davening.

17. And it came about, on one of the yamim when he was teaching Torah, that the Perushim and Sofrim who had come from every shtetl of the Galil and Yehudah and Yerushalayim, were sitting down.  And the power of Hashem was with Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach to bring refu'ah.

18. And-- hinei!--bnei Adam were carrying on a mat a man who had been paralyzed and they were seeking to carry in the paralytic and to place him before Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach.

19. And not having found by what way they might carry him because of the multitude, and having gone up onto the roof, they let the man down with the mat through the tiles so that he was right in the center in front of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach.

20. And having seen their emunah, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, "Ish (man), your chatta'im have received selicha."

21. And the Sofrim began to raise kashes (questions), and also the Perushim, saying, "Who is this who is speaking Chillul Hashem gidduf (blasphemy)? Who is able to grant selicha to chatta'im but Hashem alone?" [Yeshayah 43:25]

22. But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach having had da'as of their thoughts, said to them in reply, "Why are you reasoning in your levavot?

23. "Which is easier: to say, `Your chatta'im have been granted selicha,' or to say, `Get up and walk?'

24. "But in order that you may have da'as that the Ben HaAdam has samchut (authority) on ha'Aretz to grant selicha to chatta'im," Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to the one having been paralyzed, "To you I say, get up, pick up your mat, and go to your bais."

25. And at once the man arose in front of them, picked up the mat upon which he was lying, and departed to his bais, shouting, "Baruch Hashem!"

26. And astonishment seized everyone, and they were shouting "Baruch Hashem!" And they were filled with yirat Shomayim, saying, "Hayom our eyes have beheld nifla'ot!" THE KERI'AH (CALLING) OF MATTITYAHU THE MOCHES--THE SICHAS SEUDAH SHEL TALMIDE CHACHAMIM (THE TABLE TALK OF THE WISE)  (MT9:9-13; MK 2:13-17)

27. And after these things Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach went out and saw a moches (tax collector) named Levi sitting in the tax office, and he said to him, "Follow me."

28. And having forsook all and having got up, Levi was following Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach.

29. And Levi arranged a large seudah in his bais for Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, and there was a great number of mochesim and others who were with them, reclining at tish.

30. And the Perushim and their Sofrim were murmuring against Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach's talmidim, saying, "Why with the mochesim and chote'im are you eating and drinking?"

31. And in reply, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "It is not the bari'im (healthy ones) who have need of a rofeh (physician), but the cholim;

32. "I have not come to call the tzaddikim but chote'im to teshuva."     REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH GIVES HIS TALMIDIM MASHALIM ABOUT TZOMOT (FASTS) (MT 9:14-17; MK 2:18-22)

33. But they said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Yochanan's talmidim undergo tzomot (fasts) often and offer tefillos; likewise also the ones of the Perushim; but your talmidim eat and drink."

34. But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "You are not able to make the Bnei haChuppah undergo tzomot while the Chosson is with them, are you?

35. "But yamim will come when the Chosson is taken away from them; then, in those yamim, they will undergo tzomot."  A DERECH CHADASHA IN REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH IS NECESSARY FOR JUDAISM'S BRIT CHADASHA, EVEN THOUGH SOME ARE COMPLACENT AND CONTENT WITH WHAT IS NOT CHADASH (SEE ACTS CHAPTERS 15 AND 21)

36. Now Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was telling also a mashal to them: "No one tears a piece from a new garment, and sews it as a patch on old garment. Otherwise, both the new will be torn, and the patch from the new will not match the old.

37. "And no one puts yayin chadash into old wineskins; otherwise, the new wine will burst the wineskins and it will be spilled and the wineskins will be destroyed.

38. "Rather, yayin chadash must be put into new wineskins.

39. "And no one having drunk the old desires the chadash, for he says, `The alter (old) is beser (better).'"

## Luke 6

1. And it came about on Shabbos that Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach is passing through grain fields, and his talmidim were plucking and eating the heads of grain and rubbing them in their hands. [Devarim 23:25]

2. Now some of the Perushim said, "Why are you doing what is asur (impermissible) on Shabbos?"

3. And in reply, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Have you not read what Dovid HaMelech did when he and those with him were  hungry, [Shmuel Alef 21:6]

4. "how he entered into the Beit Hashem and took the Lechem HaPanim (the Bread of the Presence), and he ate and gave to the ones with him, which is mutar (permissible) to eat only by the kohanim?"  [Vayikra 24:5,9]

5. And he was saying to them, "The Ben HaAdam (Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14) is Adon HaShabbos."

6. And it came about on another Shabbos that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach entered into the shul and taught Torah. And there was a man there also whose right hand was withered.

7. Now the Sofrim and Perushim were watching Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to see if he brings refu'ah on Shabbos, in order that they might find something to accuse him.

8. But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach knew their thoughts, and said to the man having the withered hand, "Rise and stand in the midst."  And the man got up and stood.

9. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "I ask you whether it is mutar (permissible) on Shabbos to do haTov or to do haRah, to save nefesh or destroy it?"

10. And having looked around at all of them, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to the man, "Stretch out your hand."  And he did. And his hand was restored.

11. But they (the Sofrim and the Perushim) were filled with fury, and they were discussing with one another what they might do to him.  REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH SUMMONS HIS SHNEYM ASAR TALMIDIM WITH SHIMON KEFA AS HIS GABBAI [ASSISTANT]  (MT 10:1-4; MK 3:14-19; 6:12-16)

12. Now it came about in those yamim that Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach went forth to the mountain to daven, and he was spending the whole night b'tefillah to Hashem.

13. And when boker came, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach summoned his talmidim, and having chosen from them Shneym Asar, whom he also named Shluchim:

14. Shimon, whom also he called Kefa, and Andrew his brother, and Ya'akov and Yochanan and Philippos and Bar-Talmai,

15. and Mattityahu and T'oma and Ya'akov Ben-Chalfai, and Shimon, the one being called the Zealot,

16. and Yehudah Ben-Ya'akov, and Yehudah from K'riot, who became the boged (traitor, betrayer) of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

17. And having come down with them, he stood on a level place, and a great multitude of his talmidim, and a great multitude of the Am Berit from all Yehudah and Yerushalayim and the coastal region of Tzor and Tzidon,

18. came to hear him and to receive refu'ah from their machalot, and the ones being troubled by ruchot hatemei'ot (unclean spirits, shedim) were given refu'ah,

19. and all were seeking to touch Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach because ko'ach (power) was going out from him, and he was giving refu'ah to everyone.

20. And lifting up his eyes to look at his talmidim, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, "Ashrey are the the aniyim (poor), for yours is the Malchut Hashem.

21. "Ashrey are the ones ra'evim (hungering) now, for you will eat your fill. Ashrey are the ones weeping now, for you will laugh [Yeshayah 55:1,2; 61:2,3]

22. "Ashrey are you when bnei Adam have sinas chinam for you and when they ostracize you and they reproach you and cast out your name as rah (evil) on account of the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14).

23. "Have simcha in that day and leap for chedvah (rejoicing), for--hinei--your sachar is gadol in Shomayim. According to the same things their Avot were doing to the nevi'im.

24. "But oy to you, you ashirim, for you have already received in full your nechamah (comfort).

25. "Oy to you, the ones having been well fed now, for you will hunger. Oy, the ones laughing now, for you will mourn and weep. [Yeshayah 65:13; Mishle 14:13]

26. "Woe when all bnei Adam speak well of you. For according to the same things were their Avot doing to the nevi'ei hasheker (false prophets).

27. "But to you I say, to the ones listening, show ahavah to the your oyvim (enemies), do mitzvahs for the ones with sinas chinam for you,

28. "Say a berakhah for the ones cursing you, daven for the ones mistreating you.

29. "To the one hitting you on the cheek, offer also the other, and from the one taking away your kaftan (coat), also the tunic and gartel do not withhold.

30. "To everyone asking you, give tzedakah; and from the one taking away your things, do not demand them back. [Devarim 15:7,8; Mishle 21:26]

31. "And just as you want that bnei Adam may do to you, do to them similarly.

32. "And if you show ahavah to the ones showing ahavah to you, what kind of shvakh (commendation) to you is that? For even the chote'im show ahavah to the ones showing ahavah to them.

33. "For even if you do mitzvahs for the ones doing mitzvahs for you, what kind of shvakh to you is that?

34. "And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what kind of shvakh to you is that?  Even chote'im lend to chote'im, that they receive in return the same amount.

35. "But show ahavah to your oyvim and do mitzvahs and Gemilut Chasadim, expecting nothing in return. And your sachar will be rav.  And you will be bnei Elyon (sons of the Most High), because he is kind to anashim ra'im and those without hodayah.

36. "Be anashim of rachamanut (compassion) just as also your Elohim HaAv is rachum (compassionate)." [Tehillim 103:8] ON GIVING UP A FARIBEL (GRUDGE)

37. "Judge not, lest you be judged. And do not condemn, and by no means may you be condemned. If you pardon with mechila (forgiveness), you will be pardoned with selicha (forgiveness).

38. "Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, having been pressed down and having been shaken, overflowing, will be put into your lap. For by what measure you measure it will be measured in return to you." [Tehillim 79:12; Yeshayah 65:6,7]

39. Now Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach told also a mashal to them.  "Surely an ivver (blind man) is not able to guide an ivver, is he? Will not both fall into a pit?

40. "A talmid is not above his moreh (teacher). But everyone, having been fully trained, will be like his moreh (teacher).

41. "And why do you see the speck in the eye of your ach, but the log in your own eye you do not notice?

42. "How are you able to say to your ach, "Ach, let me remove the speck in your eye,' while you yourself are not seeing the log in your own eye?  Tzevu'a, remove first the log from your eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck in the eye of your ach.  THE SOURCE OF LASHON HORAH: THE AITZ AND ITS P'RI

43. "For there is no aitz tov producing p'ri rah, nor again an Aitz rah producing p'ri tov.

44. "For each aitz by its own p'ri will be known. For not from thorns do they gather figs nor from a thorn bush do they pick grapes.

45. "The ish tov from the good storehouse of the lev (heart) produces tov, and the ish rah out of the evil storehouse produces rah. For from the abundance of the lev the mouth speaks." REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH EXPLAINS THE CAUSE OF THE CHURBAN

46. "And why do you call me, `Adoni,' and yet you do not do what I say?

47. "Everyone coming to me and hearing my divrei Torah and putting them into practice, I will show you to whom he is likened.

48. "He is likened to the man building a bais who dug and went down deep and laid a yesod (foundation) upon the av sela (bed rock).  And a flood having come, the river struck against that bais, and the flood was not strong enough to shake it, because its binnuy (construction) was firm.

49. Now the one having heard [Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach's divrei Torah], and not having put them into practice, is like a man having built a bais upon the ground without a yesod, which the river struck against, and ofen ort (immediately) the bais collapsed, and gadol was the churban of that bais.

## Luke 7

1. When he completed all his divrei torah in the oznei haAm (ears of the people), Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach entered into K'far-Nachum.

2. Of a certain eved of a centurion (an eved dear to him) was having a machla and was near mavet.

3. And having had da'as of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, the centurion sent to him zekenim of the Yehudim, asking him to come and to give refu'ah to his eved.

4. And when they had come to Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, they were earnestly entreating him, saying, "He is a worthy man that you grant this for him.

5. "For he is one of the hasidei ummot haOlam who loves our Jewish people and he built for us our shul."

6. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was starting out on his way with them; and when he was already not far from the bais, the centurion sent beloved re'im, saying to him, "Adoni, do not trouble yourself further, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof;

7. "Therefore, I did not consider myself worthy to come to you.  But just say the dvar, and my eved will receive refu'ah. [Tehillim 107:20]

8. "For I too am a man placed under the yad memshalah (the hand governing authority), having chaiyalim (soldiers) under myself, and I say to this one, `Go,' and he goes, and to another, `Come,' and he comes, and to my eved, `Do this,' and he does it."

9. And having heard these things, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was mispoyel (marvelling) at him, and, having turned to the multitude following him, he said, "I say to you, nowhere even in Yisroel have I found such great emunah."

10. And when the ones having been sent returned to the bais, they found the eved being shalem b'guf (healthy).  A LEVAYE (FUNERAL) IN THE GALIL AND THE RAISING OF THE BEN OF THE ALMANAH OF NA'IM (JO 7:11-17)

11. And it came about on the next day that Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach proceeded to a shtetl called Na'im, and his talmidim were traveling along with him as well as a great company of people.

12. Now as Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach approached the sha'ar of the shtetl--hinei!--an ish met (dead man) was been carried out for kevurah (burial); he was the ben yachid of his em, and she was an almanah, and a considerable crowd from the shtetl was with her.

13. And when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu saw her, he had rachmonus over her and said, "Do not weep."

14. And having approached, he touched the aron met (coffin); and the bearers stood still, and he said, "Bochur, to you I say, get up."

15. And the niftar sat up and he began to speak, and Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach gave him to his em (mother).

16. And everyone was filled with yirat Shomayim and they were shouting, "Baruch Hashem!" And they were saying, "A navi gadol is among us, and Hashem has visited his people."

17. And this shema (report) about him went out in all Yehudah and in all the surrounding countryside.  CONFIRMATION FROM TANACH AFTER FARHERERS (EXAMINERS) ARE SENT TO REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH  (MT 11:2-19)

18. And Yochanan's talmidim reported to him about all these things. And when he had summoned a certain two of his talmidim, Yochanan

19. sent them to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu, saying, "Are you Hu HaBah [Moshiach] or should we be looking for another?"

20. And when the men had come to him, they said, "Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva sent us to you, saying, `Are you Hu HaBah [Moshiach] or should we be looking for another?'"

21. At genoi (exactly) that time, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gave refu'ah to many with machalot and afflictions and ruchot ra'ot and to many ivverim he granted sight.

22. And in reply he said to them, "Go and tell Yochanan what you have seen [as edey re'iyah]. IVRIM RO'IM, pisechim (lame persons) walk, the metzorim (lepers) are cleansed, and chereshim (deaf persons) hear, the mesim are restored to life, ANIYIM (poor) have the Besuras HaGeulah preached to them. [Yeshayah 29:18,19; 35:5,6; 61:1,2]

23. "And ashrey (happy) is whoever does not find a michshol (stumbling block, obstacle, Yeshayah 57:14) in me [as Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach]."

24. And when the messengers of Yochanan had departed, he began to say to the multitudes about Yochanan, "What did you go out bamidbar to see?  A reed shaken by the wind?

25. "But what did you go out to see?  A man dressed in a dandy's soft clothing?--Hinei--the ones with glorious apparel are living in luxury as courtiers in the palaces.

26. "But what did you go out to see?  A navi?  Ken, I say to you, and one more than a navi.

27. "This one is he about whom it has been written,--HINENI SHOLEIACH MALAKHI ("Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your derech in front of you" [Malachi 3:1]

28. "I say to you, among those born of isha there is no one greater than Yochanan, yet he who is least in the Malchut Hashem is greater than he."

29. (And when kol haAm and the mochesim heard this, they acknowledged the Tzidkat Hashem, having been submitted to the tevilah of teshuva of Yochanan.

30. But the Perushim and the Ba'alei HaTorah rejected the tachlis of Hashem for their lives, refusing the tevilah of teshuva of Yochanan.)

31. "Therefore, to what will I compare the people of haDor hazeh (this generation) and what are they like?

32. "They are like yeladim sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another; and they say, `We played the chalil (flute) for you and you did not dance;  we sang a kina (lament, funeral dirge) and you did not weep.'

33. "For Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva has come not eating lechem nor drinking yayin, and you say, `He has a shed (demon)!'

34. "The Ben HaAdam [Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14] has come eating and drinking, and you say, `Hinei!  A man who is a zolel (glutton) and a soveh (drunkard), a friend of mochesim and chote'im.'

35. "Yet chochmah is justified by all of her yeladim."


 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH IN THE BAIS OF SHIMON, ONE OF THE PERUSHIM; A CRITIQUE OF THE PERUSHIM VIS A VIS MOSHIACH; THE SOFEK (SUSPICION) WITH WHICH THEY VIEWED HIM AND THE EVIL NATURE OF IT

36. Now a certain one of the Perushim was requesting Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach at tish, and, he, having entered into the bais of the Parush, reclined to eat.

37. And--hinei--an isha (woman) was in the shtetl, an isha chota'at (a woman of sin), and, when she had da'as that Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach reclines at tish in the bais of the Parush, she brought an alabaster flask of shemen bosem (perfume).

38. She stood behind him, and then she began weeping at his feet, and with her tears she began to wash the feet of Rebbe Melech MaMoshiach and she was drying them with her hair, and she was kissing his feet and was anointing them with shemen bosem (perfume).

39. But when the Parush who had invited Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach saw this, he said to himself, `If this one were a navi, he would have had da'as who and what sort of isha is touching him, because she is an isha chotet (woman of sin).'

40. And in reply, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Shimon, I have something to say to you."  And he said, "Speak, Rabbi."

41. "Two persons were debtors to a certain creditor; the one was owing a choiv (debt) of chamesh me'ot (five hundred) denarii and the other a choiv (debt) of chamishim (fifty).

42. "Not being able to repay, the creditor graciously forgave both debts.  Therefore which of them will have more ahavah for him?"

43. In reply, Shimon said, "I suppose the one whom the creditor forgave more." And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Your judgment is in gantzen nachon (entirely correct)."

44. And having turned to the isha, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to Shimon, "Do you see this isha?  I entered your bais, you did not give me mayim for my feet, but she has washed my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her rosh. [Bereshis 18:4; Shofetim 19:21]

45. "You did not give me neshikah (kiss), but she, from the time I entered, did not stop kissing my feet.

46. "With shemen my rosh you did not anoint. But she with shemen bosem (perfume) anointed my feet. [Tehillim 23:5; Kohelet 9:8]

47. "Oib azoi (consequently), I say to you, her chatta'im, which are many, have been granted selicha (forgiven), for with rabbah ahavah she loved. But he who is mekabel selicha only a little, has ahavah only a little."

48. And he said to her, "Your averos have been granted selicha."

49. And the ones reclining at tish with Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach began to say to themselves, "Who is this who even grants selicha to averos?"

50. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to the isha, "Your emunah has gained you Yeshu'at Eloheinu. L'chi L'shalom. (Go in shalom!)"

## Luke 8

1. And it came about afterwards that he was traveling through every shtetl and village preaching and proclaiming the Besuras HaGeulah of the Malchut Hashem; and the Shneym Asar were with Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach.

2. And there were some nashim who had received refu'ah from ruchot ra'ot and machalot: Miryam (called Magdalit), from whom shivah shedim had gone out,

3. and Yochanah the wife of Kuza, the steward of Herod; Shoshanah, and many others who were giving maamadot (contributions) for Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach from their private means.   THE MASHALIM OF REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH  (MT 13:1-53; MK 4:1-34; LK 8:4-18)  WILL YOU OR WON'T YOU BEAR P'RI IN MOSHIACH?

4. Now when a large multitude were coming together and the ones in every shtetl were making their derech to him, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach spoke by way of a mashal:

5. The one sowing went out to sow his seed; and as he sows, some [seeds] fell beside the road; and it was trampled upon, and the birds of the air devoured it.

6. And other seed fell upon the rock, and as soon as it grew up,  it dried up because it has no moisture.

7. And other seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it.

8. And other seed fell in the adamah tovah and, having grown up, produced p'ri a hundredfold.  As Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said these things, he was calling out, "The one having oznayim (ears) to hear, let him hear."

9. Now Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach's talmidim began questioning him as to what this mashal might be.

10. And he said, "To you it has been granted to have da'as of the razei Malchut Hashem (mysteries of the Kingdom of G-d), but to the others I speak in mashalim, in order that `YIRU they may see and V'SHIM'U they may not have binah.'" [Yeshayah 6:9]

11. "Now the mashal is this: The seed is the dvar Hashem.

12. "The ones beside the road are the ones having heard, then Hasatan comes and takes away the dvar Hashem from their levavot, so that they may not have emunah and come to Yeshua'at Eloheinu.

13. "Now the ones upon the rock are those who when they hear, with simcha they receive the dvar; and these have no shoresh (root).  They have emunah for a while, but in time of nisayon, they become shmad and they fall away.

14. "Now the seed which fell among thorns, these are the ones who have heard, and as they go on their derech, they are choked  by the da'agot (worries, anxieties) and osher (riches) and ta'anugot (pleasures) of the Olam Hazeh and they bring no p'ri to maturity.

15. "Now the one in the adamah tova, these are those who have heard the dvar Hashem with a lev tov and yeshar, and retain the dvar Hashem and bear p'ri with zitzfleisch (patience).

16. "Now no one having lit a menorah covers it with a jar or places it under a bed; but he places the menorah on the shulchan, in order that the ones entering may see the ohr (light).

17. "For nothing is nistar (hidden) which will not become nikar (evident), nor anything nelam (hidden) which shall not be made known and come to ohr (light).

18. "Therefore, be shomer how you listen, for whoever has, to  him shall more be given; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him." 
 WHO ARE THE TRUE ACHIM OF REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH?  (MT 12:46-50; MK 3:31-35)

19. And the em of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and his achim came to him, and they were not able to get to him because of the multitude.

20. And it was announced to him, "Your em (mother) and your achim have been standing outside waiting to see you."

21. But in reply, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "My em and my achim are these: the ones who are shomei dvar Hashem and also shomrei dvar Hashem." 
 REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH THE BAAL HANES AND THE BAAL MOFET

22. Now it came about on one of those yamim that he and his talmidim embarked into a sirah (boat) that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Let us go over to the other side of the lake."  And they launched out.

23. But as they were sailing, he fell asleep; and a driving storm of wind descended upon the lake, and they began to be swamped and began to be in pikuach nefesh (imminent danger).

24. And they came and woke him up, saying, "Adoneinu, Adoneinu, we are perishing!"  And having been awakened, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach rebuked the wind and the rough waves, and the storm ceased.  And all became calm. [Tehillim 107:29]

25. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Where is your emunah?"  And they were fearful and amazed, saying to one another, "Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the sea and they obey him?" [Mishle 30:4]

26. And they sailed down to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite the Galil.

27. And as Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach disembarked upon the shore, he was met from the town by a certain ish possessed by shedim; and the ish had not worn clothing for a long time and was not living in a bais but among the kevarim.

28. And having seen Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach and having cried out, he fell down before him and said in a kol gadol, "Mah li ul'chah, Yehoshua Ben El Elyon? ("What to me and to you, Yehoshua Son of the Most High G-d?")  I beg you, do not torment me."

29. For Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach had been commanding the ruach hatemeiah (unclean spirit, shed) to come out of the ish.  For many times it had seized him; and he was restrained with chains and imprisoned by shackles and, breaking apart the bonds, he was being driven by the shed into the wilderness places.

30. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach questioned him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Legion."  For many shedim had entered him.

31. And the shedim were entreating Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, lest he might command them to depart into the abyss.

32. Now there was there a herd of many chazirim feeding there on the mountain. And the shedim begged him that he might permit them to enter into those chazirim. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach permitted the shedim.

33. And the shedim came out from the ish, and entered the chazirim, and the herd of chazirim rushed down the bank into the lake, and were drowned.

34. And when the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled and reported it in the town and on the farms.

35. And the people went out to see what had happened; and they came to him and found the ish from whom the shedim had gone out, and the ish was clothed and in his right mind, sitting at the feet of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach; and they were afraid.

36. And the edat re'iyah (eyewitnesses) reported to them how the one who had been possessed with shedim, was given refu'ah.

37. And all the multitude of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes asked Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach to depart from them; because they were being filled with pachad gadol.  So he embarked into a sirah (boat) and returned.

38. And the ish from whom the shedim had gone out was begging Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach that he might accompany him. But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach sent him away, saying, "Return

39. "to your bais and tell what great things Hashem has done for you."  And the man went away, preaching throughout the whole town, what great things Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach had done for him.         REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S TZITZIT AND TAHARAT HAMISHPOCHAH: EMUNAH AS THE MEANS OF BRINGING NASHIM BACK FROM THE STATE OF ESCHATOLOGICAL NIDDAH (SEPARATION) (MT 9:18-26; MK 5:21-43)

40. Now as Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach returns, the multitude gave him kabbalat panim (welcome), for they had all been expecting him.

41. And--hinei!--there came an ish named Ya'ir and this one was one of the Roshei Beit HaKnesset, and he fell at the feet of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, pleading with him to come to his bais;

42. for he had a bat yachidah about shteym esreh shanah in age, and she was dying. But as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went, the multitudes were pressing around him,

43. and an isha having a flow of dahm for shteym esreh shanah, and who had spent all she had on rofim (physicians) but could not  receive refu'ah from anyone, [Vayikra 15:25-30]

44. approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach from behind, and she touched the tzitzit of his garment; and ofen ort (immediately) the flow of her dahm stopped.

45. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, "Who is the one who touched me?"  And while everyone was denying it, Kefa said, "Adoneinu, the multitudes surround you and are pressing against you."

46. But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, "Someone did touch me, for I had da'as that ko'ach had gone out from me."

47. And when the isha saw that she had not escaped notice, she came trembling and fell down before Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, and declared before the people the reason she touched him, and how ofen ort (immediately) she received refu'ah.

48. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to her, "Biti (my daughter), your emunah brought your refu'ah. L'chi l'shalom (Go in shalom)."

49. While he was still speaking, someone comes from the bais of one of the Roshei Beit HaKnesset [Ya'ir], saying, "Your bat has died. No longer trouble the rabbi."

50. But when Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach heard this, he answered him, "Do not be afraid; only have emunah, and she will receive refu'ah."

51. And having come to the bais, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach did not permit anyone to enter with him, except Kefa and Yochanan and Ya'akov, and the yaldah's abbah and em.

52. And all were weeping and mourning for her; but Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, "Stop weeping, for she has not died, but is sleeping."

53. And they were making leitzonus of him, having had da'as that she was niftar.

54. But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach took her by the hand and called out, saying, "Yaldah, get up!"

55. And her ruach returned, and she got up ofen ort (immediately); and Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach gave orders that something be given to her to eat.

56. And her horim were amazed; but Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach instructed them to tell no one what had happened.

## Luke 9

1. And having called together the Shneym Asar, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach gave to them ko'ach and samchut over all the shedim and to give refu'ah to their illnesses.

2. Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach sent them out as his maggidim to preach the Malchut Hashem and to administer refu'ah to the cholim (heal the sick),

3. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Take nothing for the journey, neither walking stick nor beggar's bag nor lechem nor kesef, nor a extra kaftan.

4. And into whatever bais you may enter, remain there, and from there go out.

5. And as many as do not receive you, going out from that shtetl, shake off the dust from your feet for an edut against them.

6. And they departed and were itinerating throughout the shtetlach, preaching the Besuras HaGeulah and healing everywhere.  HEROD'S PECHADIM (TERRORS) (MT 14:1-12; MK 6:14-29)

7. Now Herod the Tetrarch heard all the things happening and he was perplexed because it was said by some that Yochanan had experienced the Techiyas HaMesim and come back,

8. by some also that Eliyahu Hanavi had appeared, but by others that some navi of the ancients arose.

9. But Herod said, "Yochanan I beheaded. Who then is this about whom I hear such things?"  And he was seeking to see him.

 REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S TISH AND THE "MANNA" FROM SHOMAYIM SERVED AT HIS FARBRENGEN (INSPIRATIONAL GATHERING, CELEBRATION) (MT 14:13-21; MK 6:30-44 JO 6:1-13)

10. And having returned, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach's Shluchim told him what things they did. And having taken them for a yechidus, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach withdrew to a shtetl being called Beth-Tzaidah.

11. But the multitudes, having realized this, followed him.  And having given them a kabbalat panim (welcome), Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was speaking to them about the Malchut Hashem, and to the ones having need of it, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was administering refu'ah.

12. Now the day began to decline. And having approached, the Shneym Asar said to Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, "Send away the multitude, so that having gone into the surrounding shtetlach and farms, they may find lodging and may find provisions, for here we are in a desolate place."

13. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "You give them [something] to eat." But they said, "There are not to us more than chamesh kikrot and dagim, shenayim, unless we go and buy for all this people okhel."

14. For there were about chamesh elafim anashim. But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to his talmidim,  "Have them recline [as at tish], chamishim in a group." [Tehillim 23:2]

15. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach's talmidim did so, and all reclined, [as at tish].

16. And having taken the chamesh kikrot and the shnei hadagim and having looked up to Shomayim, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said a berakhah over them and offered the betzi'at halechem and was giving to the talmidim to set before the multitude.

17. And they ate and all were satisfied, and they picked up shirayim, shneym asar baskets full. THE ANI MA'AMIN OF THE CORRECT (ORTHODOX JEWISH) EMUNAH, THE EMUNAH OF THE TRUE DAT HAYEHUDIT  (MT 16:13-20; MK 8:27-30)

18. And it came about while Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was davening alone, with only his talmidim with him, he questioned them, saying, "Whom do the multitudes declare me to be?"

19. And in reply they said, "Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva, but others, Eliyahu Hanavi, and others, that a certain navi of the ancients has come back to life."

20. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "And you, whom do you declare me to be?"  And in reply, Kefa said, "The Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach of Hashem."

21. And having warned them, he gave orders to tell no one this  REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH BEGINS TO GIVE THE NEVU'AH (PROPHECY) OF HIS COMING MAVET AND TECHIYAS HAMESIM; HIS TALMID'S BEIN ADAM LE-ATMOD (RELATIONSHIP TO THE SELF)  (MT16:21-28; MK 8:31-38)

22. saying, "It is necessary for the Ben HaAdam [Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14] to suffer much and to be rejected by the Ziknei HaAm (the Elders of the People) and Rashei Hakohanim and Sofrim and to be killed, and on the Yom HaShelishi to undergo the Techiyas HaMesim."

23. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was saying to all, "If anyone wishes to come after me (Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach), let him deny himself and lift up his aitz shel hinnazrut (tree of self-denial) yom yom and let him follow me.

24. "For whoever wishes to save his nefesh will lose it.  But whoever loses his nefesh on account of me (Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach), this one will save it.

25. "For what is the revach (profit) to a ben Adam who has gained the whole of the Olam Hazeh, but has lost his own self, forfeited his neshamah?

26. "For whoever is ashamed of me (Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach) and my dvarim, this one the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14) will be ashamed of, when Moshiach comes in his Kavod and the Kavod of HaAv of him and of the malachim hakedoshim.

27. "But I say to you, Omein, there are some standing here who will by no means taste mavet until they see the Malchut Hashem."
 A PREVIEW OF THE BIAS HAREBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH  (MT 17:1-13; MK 9:2-13; LK 9:28-36)

28. And it came to pass, about shemonah yamim after these divrei Moshiach, that when he had taken Kefa and Yochanan and Ya'akov, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach went up to the har (mountain) to daven.

29. And it came about that while Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach davens, the appearance of his face became different and his kaftan and all his clothing became dazzling white.

30. And--hinei--two men were conversing with Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, and these two men were Moshe Rabbeinu and Eliyahu HaNavi,

31. who appeared in kavod and were speaking of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach's Exodus, which he was about to fulfill in Yerushalayim.

32. But Kefa and the ones with him had been weighed down with sleep. And having awakened fully, they saw the kavod of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach and the two men, the ones having stood with Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach.

33. And it came about, just as they departed from Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, Kefa said, "Adoni, it is good for us to be here; let us make shalosh sukkot, one for you and one for Moshe Rabbeinu and one for Eliyahu HaNavi." (Kefa did not know what he was saying.)

34. And while Kefa was saying these things, an anan (cloud) came and was overshadowing them, and while they entered into the anan they were afraid.

35. And a Bat Kol came from the anan (cloud), saying "ZEH BENI BECHIRI, ELAV TISHMA'UN ("This is my Son the Chosen One, listen to him." [Yeshayah  42:1; Tehillim 2:7]

36. When the Bat Kol became silent, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was found alone.  And they were silent, and reported to no one in those yamim anything of what they had seen.  REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH HEALS THE BOCHUR POSSESSED BY SHEDIM   (MT 17:14-21; MK 9:14-29)

37. And it came about on the following day, when they had descended from the har (mountain), a large throng met Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach.

38. And--hinei--an ish from the multitude cried out saying, "Rabbi, I beg you to look at beni, for to me he is a ben yachid,

39. "and--hinei--a shed seizes him and suddenly lets out a shrai and throws the bochur into a convulsion with foam at the mouth and it mauls him and will scarcely depart from him.

40. "And I begged your talmidim that they might cast out the shed, and they were not able."

41. And in reply, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, "O perverse dor (generation) without emunah, until when will I be with you, and until when will I put up with you? Bring your ben here." [Devarim 32:5]

42. Even now as the bochur was approaching Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, the shed threw him down and convulsed him.  But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach rebuked the shed (the ruach hateme'ah) and administered refu'ah to the bochur, and gave him back to his abba.  REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S SECOND NEVU'AH OF HIS SUFFERING AND THE KAVOD TO FOLLOW  (MT 17:22-23; MK 9:30-32)

43. And all were amazed at the gedulat Hashem. And while all were beholding the peledike way he was doing everything, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to his talmidim,

44. "Let these divrei Hashem lodge in your ears: for the Ben HaAdam [Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14] is about to be delivered into the hands of bnei Adam."

45. But they had no binah concerning this dvar of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, and it had been hidden from them in order that they might not understand it, and they were afraid to ask him about this dvar.  A SHEILAH FOR REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH: WHO ARE THE GEDOLIM?    (MT 18:1-5; MK 9:33-37)

46. Now an argument arose among the talmidim of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, as to who might be the Gadol among them.

47. And Rebbe Melech Melech HaMoshiach, having perceived the thought of their levavot, took a yeled into his arms and stood him at his side.

48. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Whoever receives this yeled in ha-Shem of me (Moshiach), is mekabel of me. And whoever is mekabel of me is mekabel of the One who sent me. For whoever is the least among all of you, this one is the Gadol." REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH SPEAKS OF THE MICHSHOLIM OF OLAM HAZEH (MT 18:6-14; MK9:38-50)

49. And in reply Yochanan said, "Adoni, we saw someone casting out shedim b'Shem of you and we were trying to stop him, because he is not following as one of the anshei shlomeinu (men of our fraternity)."

50. But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Do not stop him. For whoever is not against you, is for you." 

 REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH REBUKES THE SHLUCHIM YA'AKOV AND YOCHANAN FOR KA'AS; HIS TAFKID (MISSION) DEMANDING RESOLUTENESS, HE SETS HIS FACE LIKE A FLINT TO GO TO YERUSHALAYIM

51. And it came about that as the Yom of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach's aliyah to Shomayim approaches, he set his face bedavka (deliberately) and resolutely to go up to Yerushalayim.

52. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach sent messengers ahead of him. And having gone, they entered into a village of Shomron in order to make arrangements for him.

53. And the people of Shomron did not receive Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, because his face was set to go to Yerushalayim.

54. And when Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach's talmidim, Ya'akov and Yochanan, witnessed this, they said, "Adoneinu, do you want that we should call aish to come down from Shomayim to consume them?" [Melachim Bais 1:10,12]

55. And, having turned around, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach rebuked them.

56. And they went to another village. IN THE OLAM HAZEH, THE REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH OF YISROEL REQUIRES TOTAL ALLEGIANCE, WITHOUT WHICH ONE CANNOT BE MEKABEL MOSHIACH

57. And as they were going on the road, a certain one said to Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, "I will follow you wherever you go."

58. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Foxes have dens and the OF HASHOMAYIM (birds of heaven, IYOV 7:13-14) have nests, but the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14) does not have a place where he may lay down his head."

59. And he said to another, "Follow  me."  But the ish said, "Adoni, allow me to go first and bury the Av of me."

60. But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Leave the mesim (dead ones, spiritually unregenerate ones without hitkhadeshut) to bury their mesim (dead ones), but you go and proclaim the Malchut Hashem."

61. And another said also, "I will follow you, Adoni. But first allow me to say l'hitraot to the ones in my bais." [Melachim Alef 19:20]

62. But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "No one having put his hand upon the plow yet looking back to the things behind is fit for the Malchut Hashem." [Bereshis 19:26]

## Luke 10

1. And after these things, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu gave s'michah to shivim (seventy) others and sent them on ahead of him shnayim shnayim (two by two) into every shtetl and place where he was about to arrive.

2. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was saying to them, "Indeed the Katzir is plentiful, but the po'alim of the Katzir are few; therefore, ask the Adon of the Katzir that he might send out po'alim into his Katzir.

3. "Go--hinei--I send you as kevasim (sheep) into the midst of ze'evim (wolves).

4. "Do not carry a bag for kesef, nor a beggar's bag, nor sandals, and, along the derech, dispense with time-consuming `Shalom Alechem's.'

5. "Into whatever bais you enter, first say, `Shalom to this bais.'

6. "And if there is a ben hashalom there, your shalom will rest upon him. Otherwise, on you it will return. REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH ORDERS THAT HIS TALMIDIM NOT MOVE FROM BAIS TO BAIS SEEKING BETTER ACCOMMODATIONS AND TRYING TO MAKE A GOOD THING OUT OF THEIR VOCATION AS IF CHASSIDUS WERE A MEANS TO PROFITEER

7. "Remain in the same bais eating and drinking the things with them. For worthy is the po'el (worker) of his wage. Do not move from bais to bais.

8. "And into whichever shtetl you enter and they receive you, eat the okhel being set before you,

9. "and administer refu'ah (healing) to the cholim and say to them, `The Malchut Hashem has come near you.'

10. "And into whatever shtetl you enter and they do not receive you, having gone out into the rehkovot (streets) of that shtetl,

11. "Say, `Even the [the Goyishe unclean] dust from your shtetl, which clings to us, we shake off from our feet as an omen of din (judgment) against you. But have da'as of this, that the Malchut Hashem has come near.'

12. "I (Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach) say to you, that for S'dom in Yom HaHu [Yom HaDin] it will be more bearable than it will be for that shtetl.

13. "Woe to you, Korazin, oy to you, Beit-Tzaidah, because if in Tzor and Tzidon had occurred the gevurot (might works of G-d) that have happened in you, long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes, they would have made teshuva.

14. "But for Tzor and Tzidon it will be more bearable in the Yom HaDin than for you.

15. "And you, K'far-Nachum, surely not up to Shomayim will you be exalted? To Gehinnom you will descend!

16. "The one listening to you, listens to me (Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach), and the one rejecting you, rejects me (Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach). But the one rejecting me (Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach), rejects the One [the G-d of Yisroel] who sent me." THE MAPPALAH (FALL, DEFEAT) OF HASATAN

17. And the Shivim returned with simcha, saying, "Adoneinu, even the shedim submit to us b'Shem of you (Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua)."

18. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "I was seeing Hasatan falling like lightning from Shomayim. [Yeshayah 14:12]

19. "Hinei--! I have given to you the ko'ach and the samchut to walk on nechashim and akrabim, and on all the ko'ach of HaOyev [Hasatan], and nothing may by any means injure you. "KATVENU B'SEFER HACHAYYIM LEMA'ANCHA ELOHIM CHAYYIM"  ("INSCRIBE US IN THE BOOK OF LIFE FOR THY SAKE, O LIVING G-D, ROSH HASHANAH AMIDAH; MORNING SERVICE YOM KIPPUR)

20. "But in this do not have a lev same'ach, on account of the ruchot (spirits) submitting to you, but have a lev same'ach that your shemot have been inscribed in Shomayim." HAVING DA'AS OF HABEN OF HAAV

21. In the same hour Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was full of simcha by the Ruach Hakodesh and he said, "Baruch Hashem, Avi, Adon HaShomayim v'haAretz, that you concealed these things from those with chochmah and saichel and you revealed them to yeladim, ken, Avi, for thus it was well-pleasing in your sight.

22. "Everything was handed over to me by Avi, and no one has da'as of HaBen except HaAv.  And no one has da'as of HaAv except HaBen, and whomever HaBen wishes to reveal [him]."

23. And, having turned to the talmidim in a yechidus, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Ashrey [are] the eyes seeing what you see.

24. "For I say to you that many nevi'im and melakhim wanted to see what you see and they did not see them, and to hear what you hear and they did not hear them.  MASHAL OF THE SHOMRONI HATOV

25. And--hinei--a certain Talmid Chacham, a Ba'al Torah, stood up, testing Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, saying, "Rabbi, what mitzva must I do to inherit Chayyei Olam?"

26. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "In the Torah what has been written? How do you read it?

27. And in reply the Ba'al Torah said, "V'AHAVTA ES ADONOY ELOHECHA B'KHOL L'VAVCHA UVECHOL NAFSHECHA UVECHOL M'ODECHA [Devarim 6:4,5] and L'RE'ACHA KAMOCHA [Devarim 6:5; Vayikra 19:18]

28. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Your answer is frum. Richtik (correct). Do this and you will live."

29. But because the Ba'al Torah wanted to justify himself, to be yitzdak im Hashem (justified with G-d, Iyov 25:4) on the basis of his own zchus (merit), he said to Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, "And who is my re'a (neighbor)?" 
 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH CHARGES HIS TALMIDIM TO BE ACHRAI (ACCOUNTABLE) FOR THE RE'A (NEIGHBOR)

30. In reply, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, "A certain ish was coming down from Yerushalayim to Yericho, and he encountered shodedim (robbers).  They stripped him and inflicted a klap (blow), more than one--they went away and left him half dead.

31. It so happened that a certain kohen was coming down by that derech, and, having seen him, he passed by on the other side. [Vayikra 21:1-3]

32. And likewise also a Levi happened upon the place, but when he came and saw him, he passed by on the other side.

33. But a certain Shomroni, traveling along on the derech, came upon him; and when he saw him, he was filled with rachamim (compassion).

34. And when this Shomroni approached, he bandaged the man's wounds, pouring shemen and yayin over them; and when he had placed him upon his own donkey, he brought the man to a malon (inn) and cared for him.

35. And on the next day he produced two denarii and gave them to the keeper of the malon and said, "Take care of him, and whatever you spend additionally, I will take care of, when I return."

36. Who of these shalosha seems to you to have become a re'a (neighbor) to the one having fallen among the shodedim?"

37. And the Ba'al Torah answered, "The one having shown the man rachamim." And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Go and do likewise." REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH RECEIVED BY MARTA AND MIRYAM AT BEIT-ANYAH (LK 10:38-42); ON WHAT IS AND IS NOT A BRACHA LEVATULLA (FRUITLESS PURSUIT)

38. And while they were on the derech, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach entered into certain shtetl.  And a certain isha by the name Marta received him.

39. And this isha had an achot (sister) named Miryam, who sat down at the feet of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu listening to his dvar.

40. But Marta was distracted with much avodas. And having stood by, she said, "Adoneinu, is it of no concern to you that my achot has left me alone to serve? Speak, then, to her that she may help me."

41. And in reply Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu said to her, "Marta, Marta, you are anxious and worried about many things,

42. "but one is necessary.  For Miryam chose haTov which will not be taken away from her."

## Luke 11

1. And it came about while Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was in a certain place davening that, when he concluded, a certain one of his talmidim said to him, "Adoneinu, teach us to daven, just as also Yochanan taught his talmidim."

2. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "When you daven, say, `Avinu, yitkadash shmecha` (`hallowed be thy Name'). `Tavo malchutechah' (`thy kingdom come').

3. `Es lechem chukeinu ten lanu yom yom' (`Give us day by day the bread we need').

4. `u-s'lach lanu al chatta'einu' (`And forgive us our sins') `Ki gam anachnu solechim lekhol hachote'im lanu' (`for we ourselves are forgiving everyone who is indebted to us.') `v'al tevi'einu lidei nissayon' (`And lead us not into temptation')."

5. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Who among you will have a chaver and will come to him at chatzot halailah (midnight), and say to him,  `Chaver, lend me shalosh kikrot;

6. `because a chaver of mine has come from a journey to me and I have nothing to set before him';

7. "and from inside he shall reply, saying, `Do not bother me; the delet has already been shut, and my yeladim and I are already in bed; I cannot get up and give to you anything.'

8. "I say to you, even if he will not get up and give him anything, because he is his chaver, at least because of his persistence he will get up and give to him as much as he needs.

9. "And I tell you, ask, and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you.

10. "For everyone asking receives; and he who is seeking, finds; and to the one knocking, it shall be opened.

11. "And what av among you is there who will ask his ben for a dag (fish), and instead of a dag (fish) will give to him a nachash (snake)?

12. "Or if the ben will ask for an beytzah (egg), will the av give him an akrav (scorpion)?

13. "If, therefore, you, though you are ra'im, have da'as of how to give matanot tovot to your yeladim, how much more will HaAv sh'baShomayim give the Ruach Hakodesh to the ones asking him."
 CHILLUL HASHEM AGAINST REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH

14. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was casting out a shed from a ish illem (mute man). And it came to pass when the shed had come out, the ish illem spoke and the multitudes were amazed.

15. But some of them said, "He casts out the shedim by Ba'al-zibbul Sar HaShedim."

16. And others, to test him, were demanding of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach an ot (sign) from Shomayim.

17. But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, having had da'as of their makhshavot (thoughts), said to them, "Every Malchut divided against itself is laid waste; and a bais divided against itself  falls.

18. "And if Hasatan also was divided against himself, how shall Hasatan's Malchut stand?  Because you say by Ba'al-zibbul I cast out shedim.

19. "But if I by Ba'al-zibbul cast out the shedim, by whom do your banim cast them out?  Consequently, they shall be your shofetim (judges).

20. "But, if I, by the finger of Hashem, cast out the shedim, then the Malchut Hashem has come upon you. [Shemot 8:19]

21. "When a Gibbor (Strong Man), fully armed, is shomer over his armon (palace), his possessions are left in shalom;

22. "but when someone stronger than him overpowers him, he takes away from him all his shiryon kaskasim (coat of scale armor) on which he had depended, and distributes his plunder." A WARNING AGAINST ANY JUDAISM THAT IS NOT MOSHIACH'S JUDAISM AND IS NOT FILLED WITH THE RUACH HAKODESH

23. "The one who is not with me is against me (Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach); and he who does not gather with me, scatters.

24. "When the ruach hatameh goes out from the ish, it goes through waterless places seeking a menukhah (resting place) and, not finding any, it says, `I will return to my bais from where I came out.

25. "And when it comes, it finds the bais having been swept and put beseder (in order).

26. "Then it goes and takes another sheva shedim more ra'ot (evil) than itself, and they enter it and dwell there; and the acharit (last) condition of that ish becomes worse than the reshit (first)."    REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH REFUSES TO ALLOW HIS TRUE TALMIDIM TO RELIGIOUSLY VENERATE HIS EM (MOTHER)

27. And it came about while Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach says these things, a certain isha in the multitude, having lifted up her voice, said to Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, "Ashrey is the womb having carried you and the breasts that nursed you."

28. But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, "Aderaba (to the contrary); ashrey are the ones hearing the dvar Hashem and being shomer mitzvot!"  [Mishle 8:32]

29. And as the multitudes are gathering even more, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach began to say, "HaDor HaZeh (this generation) is a Dor Rah!  It is seeking an ot, and an ot will not be given to it except the Ot HaYonah.

30. "For just as Yonah became to the Ninevites an ot, so also the Ben HaAdam will be an ot to HaDor HaZeh.

31. "The Queen of the South will be made to stand up alive at the [Yom HaDin] judgment with the men of HaDor HaZeh and she will declare a gezar din (verdict) of ashem (guilty), of haresha'ah (condemnation as guilty), because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the chochmah of Shlomo, and--hinei--one greater than Shlomo is here. [Melachim Alef 10:1; Divrey Hayamim Bais 9:1]

32. "Men of Nineveh will stand up at the mishpat (judgment of the Yom HaDin) with HaDor HaZeh and will condemn it, because they made teshuva at the preaching of Yonah, and--hinei--one greater than Yonah is here.

33. "No one having lit a menorah puts it in a hidden place, nor under the measuring bucket, but on the shulchan, in order that the ones entering may see the ohr." 
 THE FATAL MISTAKE OF RABBINIC JUDAISM WITHOUT HITKHADESHUT (AS OPPOSED TO BRIT CHADASHA ORTHODOX JUDAISM)

34. "The menorah of the guf (body) is your ayin (eye). When your ayin is sound, then your entire guf (body) is full of ohr. But when it is rah, then your guf (body) is full of choshech.

35. "See to it, then, that the ohr in you is not choshech (darkness).

36. "If therefore, your whole guf (body) is full of ohr and not having any part choshech, it will be all full of ohr as when the menorah with the ohr (light) shines on you."

37. Now while Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach spoke, a Parush asks him that he might have betzi'at halechem (have a meal, breaking of bread) with him. And, having entered, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach reclined at tish.

38. And the Parush, having seen this, was amazed that Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach did not first do n'tilat yadayim before the meal.

39. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu said to him, "Now you Perushim wash the outside of the kos and the dish you clean, but the inside of you is full of gazel (robbery) and resha.

40. "Goylomim! Did not the one having made the outside also make the inside?

41. "But as far as what is inside, give tzedakah, and --hinei-- everything is tahor (clean) to you.

42. "But oy to you, Perushim, because you give as ma'aser (tithe) the mint and the rue and every herb and you disregard the mishpat and the ahavah of Hashem. But these things it was necessary to do and those not to disregard.  [Devarim 6:5; Michoh 6:8]

43. "Oy to you Parush! Because your ahavah is for the moshavot harishonim in the shuls and the sh'elat shalom greetings in the market places.

44. "Woe to you, because you are like the unmarked kevarim (graves), and bnei Adam walk over them without having da'as."

45. And, in reply, one of the Ba'alei Torah says to him, "Rabbi, by saying these things you insult us also."

46. But Rebbe, Melech, HaMoshiach said, "Also woe to you Ba'alei Torah, because you burden men with [halachic] loads difficult to carry, and you yourselves with so much as one of your fingers do not touch the loads [with a heter].

47. "Woe to you, because you build the matsevot (tombstone monuments) for the kivrot haNevi'im (the sepulchres of the prophets), but it was your avot who killed them.

48. "Therefore, you are edim (witnesses) and in agreement with the deeds of your avot, because they do the killing of them part  and you do the providing of the matsevot part.

49. "Therefore, also the Chochmah of Hashem said, `I will send to them Nevi'im and Shluchim, some of whom they will kill and persecute, [Lu.20:9-19]

50. `that the Dahm of all the Nevi'im that has been poured out from the hivvased haOlam may be charged to HaDor HaZeh,

51. `from the blood of Hevel to the blood of Zecharyah who was killed al Kiddush ha-Shem between the Mitzbe'ach and the Beis Hashem;' ken, I tell you, it will be required from HaDor HaZeh." [Bereshis 4:8; Divrey Hayamim Bais 24:20,21]

52. "Woe to you Ba'alei Torah, because you took the mafte'ach of da'as; you yourselves did not enter in; and the ones entering in you hindered."

53. And when he went from there, the Sofrim and the Perushim began to be terribly hostile and to hock (pose constant questions) Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and to subject him to a wide ranging cross-examination,

54. plotting to catch him in something from his mouth.

## Luke 12

1. Meanwhile, when the multitudes by the thousands assembled, to the point of trampling one another, Rebbe, Melech, HaMoshiach said this in a yechidus first to his talmidim, "Be shomer regarding the Se'or of the Perushim, which is their tzeviut (hypocrisy).

2. "And nothing that men hide in a "cover up" is concealed which will not be revealed, and nothing held in secret which will not be laid bare.

3. "So then, what things you said in the choshech, will be heard in the ohr; and what you whispered in the ear in the secret chadarim (rooms) will be shouted from the roof tops.

4. "I say to you, my chaverim, do not have pachad of the killers of the guf (body), who after that have nothing more they can do.

5. "But I will show you Someone of whom you should have yir'ah; fear the one who after killing the body has the samchut to throw into Gehinnom. Ken, I say to you, have yir'ah of this One.

6. "Are not chamesh sparrows sold for two assarion? And not even one of them has been overlooked in the eynayim of Hashem.

7. "But even the hairs of your rosh have all been counted.  Never fear. You are of more worth than many sparrows.

8. "And I say to you, whoever will declare publicly the Ani Ma'amin of me [as Moshiach] before bnei Adam, the Ben HaAdam [Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14] will make hoda'ah (acknowledgement) of him before the malachim of Hashem.

9. "But the one having made hakhchashah (denial) of me [as the Ben HaAdam Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14] before bnei Adam will be denied before the malachim of Hashem.

10. "And everyone who will say a dvar against the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14), he will be given selicha. But the one  having committed Chillul Hashem gidduf (blasphemy) against the Ruach Hakodesh will not be given selicha." WHEN THEY BRING YOU BEFORE BATEI MISHPAT (COURTS OF LAW)

11. "And when they bring you in before the shuls and the rulers and the manhigim, do not have a lev rogez (anxious heart) about what you should speak in your own defense, or about your legal brief.

12. "For the Ruach Hakodesh will be your rabbi teaching you in the same hour what it is necessary to say." [Shemot 4:12]    COVETOUSNESS AND THE MASHAL OF THE RICH MAN (ON THE FOLLY OF GASHMIUS [MATERIALISM])

13. And some one out of the multitude said to him, "Rabbi, speak to my ach to share with me the yerushah (inheritance).

14. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Ben Adam, who appointed me a shofet or an arbitrator over you?"

15. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Take care and be shomer against all chamdanut, because the Chayyei HaAdam does not consist in the abundance of his possessions." [Iyov 20:20; 31:24; Tehillim 62:10]

16. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach spoke a mashal to them saying, "An aza (certain kind of) ish ashir (rich man) had land that produced a good crop.

17. "And he was thinking to himself saying, `What should I do? Because I do not have a place where I will store my crops.'

18. "And he said, `This I will do, I will tear down my asim (barns) and I will build larger asim. And there I will gather all my grain and my produce.

19. `And I will say to my neshamah, "Neshamah, you have an ample  store of goods for many years to come.  Take your ease, LE'EKHOL, V'LISHTOT, V'LISHMO'ACH ("to eat, to drink, and to be merry" (Kohelet 8:15)

20. "But Hashem said to him, `Goilem! Halailah hazeh your nashamah is required of you. Now to whom will be given what you prepared?' [Yirmeyah 17:11; Iyov 27:8; Tehillim 39:6; 49:10]

21. "Such is the one hoarding up for himself and not being osher  toward Hashem."
 THE RAVENS AND LILIES  (LK 12:22-34)

22. And Rebbe, Melech, HaMoshiach said to his talmidim, "Therefore, I say to you: do not have a LEV ROGEZ (Devarim 28:65), for your Chayyim, about your okhel or your guf (body), what you might put on.

23. "For the neshamah is more than okhel and the guf (body) more than kaftan and gartel. [Bereshis 47:18; Tehillim 16:9-10; Iyov 19:25-27; Yeshayah 53:11]

24. "Consider the ravens! They do not sow nor reap, they have no storeroom or asam (barn), yet Hashem feeds them.  Of how much more worth are you than the OF HASHOMAYIM [Iyov 38:41; Tehillim 147:9]

25. "And can any of you by means of a LEV ROGEZ add one cubit to your span of Chayyim?

26. "If then you are not able to do even a small thing, why have a LEV ROGEZ about the rest?

27. "Consider the lilies! How they grow! A lily does not labor nor spin. But I say to you, not even Shlomo HaMelech in all his kavod was arrayed like one of these. [Melachim Alef 10:4-7]

28. "And if Hashem so enrobes the grass of the field, which is here hayom and thrown into the aish makhar (tomorrow), how much more will Hashem enrobe you, you ones of little emunah.

29. "And don't keep striving after okhel (food) and skikuy (drink), and don't have a lev rogez.

30. "For all these things the Goyim of the Olam Hazeh strive after, but your Av [sh'baShomayim] has da'as that you need these things.

31. "But seek the Malchut Hashem, and these things will be added to you.

32. "Do not have pachad, Eder Katan (Little Flock), because it is the ratzon, the chefetz of your Av [shba'Shomayim] to give you the Malchut.

33. "Sell your possesions and give tzedakah. Make for yourselves the baitel (wallet) that don't wear out, an inexhaustlble otzar in Shomayim, where no ganav comes near nor moth destroys.

34. "For where your otzar is, there also will be your lev."  REFERENCE TO THE BIAS HAMOSHIACH

35. "Tighten your gartels for action and have your menorahs lit.

36. "And you should be like bnei Adam who expectantly khakeh le'bo'o shel (await the arrival of) their Adon when he returns from the Chassuna, in order that, when he comes and knocks, ofen ort (immediately) they may open the delet for him.

37. "Ashrey are those avadim (servants), whom, having come, the Adon will find keeping shomer. Omein, I say to you, that he will fasten his gartel, and have those avadim sit down to tish, and he will come and serve them.

38. "And if in the second and if in the third watch he comes and  finds it thus, ashrey are those.

39. "But have da'as of this, that if the Ba'al Bayit had had da'as in what hour the ganav comes, he would not have allowed his bais to be broken into.

40. "So you be shomer, for the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14) comes in a hour you do not think."

41. And Kefa said, "Adoneinu, are you speaking this mashal for us or for all?"

42. And HaAdon said, "Who then is the sochen hane'eman and navon (faithful and wise steward) whom HaAdon will appoint over his avadim to give them their food allowance at the proper time?

43. "Ashrey is that eved, whom, having come, his Adon will find doing thus.

44.  "Omein, I say to you, that he will appoint him over all that he has.

45. "But if that eved says in his lev, `Adoni delays to come to me,' and he begins to beat ha'avadim and hashefakhot, and to gluttonize and get down in his schnapps,

46. "HaAdon of that eved will come on a day which he does not expect and at an hour of which he does not have da'as, and will cut him in pieces and assign him the Apikoros' portion with the unbelievers.

47. "That eved, who had da'as of the ratzon of his Adon and did not get prepared or do according to his ratzon, will be beaten with klap (blow) not a few. [Devarim 25:2]

48. "But the one not having had da'as, but having done things worthy of a klap, will receive but a few. But to everyone to whom much was given, much will be required from him, and to whom was entrusted much, even more achraius (accountability) will be required." [Vayikra 5:17; Bamidbar 15:27-30] REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S DESIRE FOR HIS TEVILAH OF MAVET TO BE COMPLETED (LK 12:49-59) AND THE DIVISION BETWEEN THOSE WITH HITKHADESHUT AND THOSE WITHOUT HITKHADESHUT

49. "I came to throw Aish on the earth, and how I wish it was already kindled!

50. "And I have a tevilah I have to be submerged with, and how I am distressed until it is completed.

51. "Do you think that I came to bring Shalom on the earth? No, I tell you, but rather machaloket (division),

52. "For there will be from now chamesh in one bais having been divided, shalosha against shenayim and shenayim against shalosha,

53. "`AV will be divided against BEN and BEN against AV, EM (mother) against BAT and BAT against EM, KALLAH BACHAMOT (daughter-in-law against mother-in-law) and CHAMOT against KALLAH.'" [Michoh 7:6]

54. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying also to the multitudes, "When you see the anan rising over the ma'arav (west), ofen ort (immediately) you say `A geshem is coming,' and so it happens.

55. "And when there is a south wind blowing, you say `It will be kham (hot),' and it happens.

56. "Tzevu'im! You have da'as how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky; how is it, then, that you do not have da'as of how to interpret HaZman HaZeh?

57. "And why also for yourselves do you not judge what is yashar (straight, right)?

58. "For as you go with your ish riv (opponent in a lawsuit) to appear before the magistrate, on the derech make an effort to settle with him, lest he drag you to the shofet, and the shofet will hand over you to the shoter, and the shoter will throw you into the beit hasohar.

59. "I say to you, by no means may you come out, until even the last peruta (small coin) you pay back."

## Luke 13

1. Now on the same occasion there were some present reporting to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach about the men of the Galil whose blood Pilate mixed with their zevakhim (sacrifices).

2. And, in reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Do you think that these men of the Galil were greater chote'im than all others of the Galil, because they suffered this shud (misfortune)?

3. "Lo, I say, but unless you make teshuva, you will all likewise perish.

4. "Or do you think that those shmonah asar (eighteen) upon whom the migdal (tower) in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were greater chote'im that all the bnei Adam living in Yerushalayim?

5. "Lo, I tell you, but unless you make teshuva, you will all likewise perish."

6. And he was speaking this mashal.  "A certain man had an aitz te'enah (fig tree) which had been planted in his kerem, and he came seeking p'ri on it, and he did not find any. [Yeshayah 5:2; Yirmeyah 8:13]

7. "So he said to the keeper of the kerem, `Hinei--shalosh shanim I come seeking p'ri on this aitz te'enah (fig tree) and I do not find any.  Therefore, cut it down!  Why is it even using up the adamah?'

8. "But in reply he says to him, `Adoni, leave it also this year, until I may dig around it and may throw fertilizer on it,

9. `And if indeed it produces p'ri in the future; otherwise, you will cut down it.'"  REFU'AH ON SHABBOS (LK 13:10-21); PIKKU'ACH NEFESH DOCHEH SHABBOS (THE DUTY OF SAVING LIFE OVERRIDES THE SHABBOS LAWS)

10. Now Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was teaching in one of the shuls on Shabbos.

11. And--hinei--an isha which had a ruach hamachla shmonah asar (eighteen) years was bent double and was not able to straighten up at all.

12. And when he saw her, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach called out to her and said, "Isha, you have been set free from your machla (illness)."

13. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach placed his hands upon her. And ofen ort (immediately) she was straightened and she was crying, "Baruch Hashem!"

14. And in reply the Rosh of the Beit HaKnesset, being indignant that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had healed on Shabbos, was saying to the multitude, "There are sheshet yamim (six days) in which melakhah (work) should be done; therefore, come during them and be healed; but not on Shabbos!" [Shemot 20:9]

15. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu answered him and said, "Tzevu'im!  Does not each of you on Shabbos untie his ox or his donkey from the evus and lead it away to water him?

16. "But ought not this isha, a bat Avraham Avinu as she is, whom Hasatan has bound--hinei, nebbach--these shmonah asar (eighteen) long years, should she not have been set free from this bond on Shabbos?"

17. And as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said these things, all his mitnaggedim (opponents) were put to bushah (shame), and all the multitude was having simcha with chedvah (rejoicing) over all the  things of kavod being accomplished by him. [Yeshayah 66:5]

18. Therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying, "What is the Malchut Hashem like?  And to what shall I make a tzushtel (comparison) of it?

19. "It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and threw into his own garden, and it grew and became an aitz, and the OF HASHOMAYIM nested in its branches."

20. And again Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "To what shall I compare the Malchut Hashem?

21. "It is like se'or (leaven), which an isha took and hid in shalosh measures of wheat flour until the whole batch was leavened."  A QUESTION FOR REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH: WILL THOSE WHO RECEIVE THE YESHUAT ELOHEINU BE FEW?  (LK 13:22-35)  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH PREDICTS THE EMUNAH OF YISROEL IN HIM AND HIS BIAS HAMOSHIACH ARE CONNECTED

22. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was itinerating throughout the shtetlach (towns) and villages saying shiurim and heading on toward Yerushalayim.

23. And someone said to him, "Adoni, are there only a few coming to Yeshu'at Eloheinu?" And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them,

24. "Strive to enter through the delet hatzarut (door of narrowness), because many, I say to you, will seek to enter and they will not be able to.

25. "After the Ba'al Bayit gets us and shuts the delet, and you begin to stand outside and to knock on the delet, saying, `Adoneinu, open up for us!' and in reply, he will say to you, `I do not have da'as of you, of from where you are from.'

26. "Then you will begin to say, `We ate and drank in your presence, and in our rehkovot you taught.'

27. "And he will speak, saying to you, `I do not know you, from where you are from. Go away from me, kol po'alei resha!'

28. "There will be weeping and gnashing of the teeth, when you will see Avraham Avinu and Yitzchak and Ya'akov and all the Nevi'im in the Malchut Hashem, but yourselves being thrown out.

29. "And they will come from mizrach and ma'arav and from tzafon and darom and they will bimesibba recline at tish in the Malchut Hashem.

30. "And--hinei--there are some acharonim who will be rishonim and there are some rishonim who will be acharonim."

31. In the same hour some Perushim approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying to him, "Depart and go from here, because Herod wants to kill you."

32. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Go and tell that fox, `Hinei-- behold I cast out shedim and I accomplish refu'ot (healings) hayom (today) and makhar (tomorrow) and Yom HaShelishi I reach my goal.'

33. "Nevertheless, it is necessary for me to travel on hayom and makhar and the yom following, because it cannot be that a navi should perish outside Yerushalayim.

34. "O Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim, she who kills the Nevi'im and stones the ones sent to her!  How often I wanted to gather your yeladim just as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing!

35. "Hinei-- your Beis is left to you desolate; and I say to you, you shall by no means see me until the zman comes when you say, BARUCH HABAH B'SHEM ADONAI [Yirmeyah 12:17; Tehillim 118:26]

## Luke 14

1. And it came to pass when he went into a bais of a certain one of the Rashei HaPerushim on Shabbos for betzi'at halechem, and they were watching him closely.

2. And--hinei--there in front of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was a certain ish suffering from dropsy.

3. And in reply, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach spoke to the Ba'alei Torah and Perushim, saying, "Is it mutar (permissible) on Shabbos to administer refu'ah or not?"

4. But they kept silent.  And having taken hold of him, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach granted him refu'ah and sent him away.

5. And to them Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Who of you having a ben or an ox fall into a well, and will not ofen ort (immediately) pull him out on Shabbos?"

6. And they were not able to make a reply against this.

7. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began speaking a mashal to the seudah invitees, when he noticed how they had been picking out the rashei hamoshavot (chief seats) at the tish, saying to them,

8. "When you are invited by someone to a Chassuna, you should not recline at tish in the rashei hamoshavot (chief seats), lest a more distinguished person than you may have been invited by him,

9. "and he who invited you both shall come and say to you, `Give place to this one,' and then in bushah you proceed to occupy the moshav shafel (low seat).

10. "But when you are invited, go and recline at tish in the moshav shafel, so that when the one who has invited you comes,  he may say to you, "Chaver, move up to a higher place; then you will have kavod in the sight of all who are with you at the tish.

11. "For everyone exalting himself shall be humbled, and the one humbling himself shall be exalted."

12. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was speaking also to the one who him invited him, "When you prepare a seudah or a Melave Malkah, do not invite your chaverim or your achim or your krovey mishpokhot (relatives) or your sh'khenim ha'ashirim (rich neighbors), lest they also should invite you in return and   repayment come to you.

13. "But when you prepare a seudah, invite the aniyim, the ba'alei hamum, the pisechim, the ivrim,

14. "and birkat Shomayim will befall you, because they do not have the means to repay you; for you will be repaid in the Yom Tekumat haTzadikkim."

15. And when a certain one of those reclining at tish with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach heard these things, he said to him, "Ashrey is he who will eat lechem in the Malchut Hashem!"  [Yeshayah 25:6]

16. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "A certain man was preparing a big seudah, and he invited many;

17. "And at the dinner hour, he sent his eved to say to the seudah invitees, `Come, because everything is ready now.'

18. "But each began to come up with a ptur (excuse).  The rishon said to him, `I bought a sadeh and I am compelled to go out and look at it.  Please accept my ptur (excuse).

19. "And another said, `I have bought chamesh pair of oxen, and I am going to try them out.  Please accept my ptur (excuse).'

20. "And another said, `I took a wife and therefore I am not able to come.'

21. "And the eved returned and reported this to his Adon.  Then the Ba'al Bayit became angry and said to his eved, `Go out quickly into the rehkovot and lanes of the shtetl and bring in here the aniyim and the ba'alei hamum, and the ivrim and the pisechim.'

22. "And the eved said, `Adoni, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.'

23. "And the Adon said to the eved, `Go out to the rehkovot and along the boundaries and urge them to come in, in order that my Beis may be filled.

24. `For I say to you that no one of those bnei Adam who were invited will taste my seudah.'"    REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S TALMIDIM MUST PUT MOSHIACH ABOVE ALL  (IF THEY "COME TO HIM" AS TALMIDIM AND THIS CAUSES FAMILY TO REJECT THEM, THEY MUST NOT CHOSE FAMILY OVER MOSHIACH.  HOWEVER, HERE THERE IS USE OF RABBINIC HYPERBOLE AND NO LITERAL INTERPRETATION OF THE WORD "HATE" WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE JEWISH LISTENERS FAMILIAR WITH THIS FIGURE OF SPEECH); IN APPROACHING THE MATTER OF BEING MOSHIACH'S TALMID, A MENTALITY THAT IS OISGERECHENED (CALCULATED) AND SOBER IS NECESSARY; MOSHIACH IS TELLING THEM TO TRACHT OIS (THINK THROUGH) THE BIG DECISION OF BECOMING ONE OF HIS TALMIDIM

25. And large multitudes were accompanying him, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach turned and said to them,

26. "If someone comes to me, and does not hate his own abba and em (mother) and isha and yeladim and achim and achayot and in addition also his own life [in the Olam Hazeh], he is not able to be my talmid.

27. "Whoever does not carry his own aitz [of self-denial] and come after me [Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach] is not able to be my talmid.

28. "For who among you, wanting to build a migdal (tower), wlll not first sit down and figure out the cost, to see if he has enough to complete it?

29. "Otherwise, having laid his yesod (foundation) and not being able to finish it, everyone seeing it may begin to ridicule him,

30. "saying, `This man began to build and was not able to finish.'

31. "Or what melech, going out to engage another melech in milkhamah (war), will not first sit down and consider if he is able with aseret alafim (ten thousand) to meet the one with esrim elef (twenty thousand) coming against him?

32. "Or else, while the other is noch (still) far away, he sends a delegation and seeks terms for shalom.

33. "So, then, none of you can become my talmid if you do not renounce all you possess.

34. "Therefore, melach (salt) is tov;  but if even melach should become tasteless, with what will it be seasoned?

35. "It is useless either for adamah or for the dung hill; they throw it away.  The one who has ears to hear, shema!"

## Luke 15

1. Now all the mochesim and the chote'im were coming near Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to listen to him.

2. And both the Perushim and the Sofrim were grumbling, saying, "This one welcomes chote'im and eats at tish with them."

3. And he told them this mashal, saying,

4. "What man of you, if he has me'ah kevasim (a hundred sheep) and has lost from them one, does not leave the tishim v'tish'ah (ninety-nine) in the open pasture, and go for the one which has been lost until he finds it?

5. "And when it has found it, he puts it on his shoulders with lev same'ach. [Tehillim 23;119; Yirmeyah 31:10; Yechezkel 34:11-16]

6. "And when he returns to his bais, he calls together his chaverim and his sh'khenim, saying to them, "Have simcha with me, because I have found my keves (sheep), the one that was lost!

7. "I say to you that in the same way there will be more simcha in Shomayim over one chot'eh who becomes a ba'al teshuva than over tishim v'tish'ah tzaddikim who have no need of teshuvah.

8. "Or what isha having asaret (ten) drachmas, if she loses one drachma, will not light a licht (candle) and sweep the bais and search carefully until she finds it?

9. "And having found it, she calls together chaverim and sh'khenim saying, `Have simcha with me, for I have found the drachma which I lost.'

10. "In the same way, I say to you, there is simcha in the presence of the malachim Hashem over one chot'eh who becomes a ba'al teshuva." 


 THE MASHAL OF THE BEN HAOVED (LOST SON)

11. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "A certain ben Adam had shnei banim.

12. "And the younger of them said to his abba, `Avi, give to me the share of the estate that falls to me.' And he distributed his property to them.

13. "And not many yamim later, having gathered together everything, the younger ben went on a journey to a far away country, and there he squandered his ashires with loose living.

14. "And when he had spent everything, there came a severe ra'av (famine) throughout that aretz, and he began to be nitzrach (needy).

15. "And he went and became associated with one of the citizens of that aretz, and he sent him into his fields to feed chazirim, [Vayikra 11:7]

16. "and he was longing to fill his stomach with the pods which the chazirim were eating, and no one was giving anything to him.

17. "When he came to his senses, his saichel told him, "How many of my abba's hired men have more than enough okhel and I am perishing here with hunger.

18. "I will get up and go to my abba, and I will say, `Avi, I sinned against Shomayim and in your sight. [Vayikra 26:40]

19. `I am no longer worthy to be called your ben. Make me as one of your hired men.'

20. "And when he arose he came home to his own abba. And while he was still a long way off, his abba saw him, and was filled with rachamim and tears and fell upon his neck and kissed him. [Bereshis 45:14]

21. "And his ben said to him, `Avi, I sinned against Shomayim and in your sight, no longer am I worthy to be called your ben.' [Tehillim 51:4]

22. "But his abba said to his avadim, `Hizdarez (Hurry up!) Bring out the best kaftan and clothe him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals for his feet, [Zecharyah 3:4; Bereshis 41:42]

23. `and bring the fattened calf, and slaughter it, and let us eat and have a simcha,

24. `Because this ben of mine was dead and now he has returned L'Chayyim!  He had been lost and now he is found.' And they began to make a simcha.

25. "But the abba's alterer ben was in the sadeh. And as he was coming, he drew near to the bais, and he heard the zemirot, and the sound of the klezmer (musician) and the dancing,

26. "And having summoned one of the avadim, the alterer ben was inquiring what these things might be.

27. "And the eved said to him, `Your ach is present, and your abba sacrificed the fattened calf, because your abba received him back bari v'shalem (safe and sound).'

28. "And the alterer ben was angry, and he did not want to enter.  But his abba came out and was pleading with him.

29. "But in reply the alterer ben said to his abba, `Hinei, so many years I serve you and never a mitzvah of you I disobeyed, and never for me did you give even a young goat that with my chaverim I might have a simcha.

30. `But when this ben of yours, the one having devoured your property with zonot, came, you sacrificed for him the fattened calf.' [Mishle 29:3]

31. "And the abba said to him, `Beni, you are always with me, and everything which is mine is yours.

32. `But now it was necessary for us to have lev samei'ach and make a simcha, because the ach of you was dead and he has returned l'Chayyim!  He has been lost and now is found.'" [Malachi 3:17]

## Luke 16

1. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying also to the talmidim, "A certain ish ashir (rich man) had a sochen (steward, estate manager or agent), and the charge brought against him was that he was squandering the property of the ish ashir.

2. "And having called him, he said to him, `What is this I hear about you?  Render a cheshbon (an account, audit) for that which is under your pekuddat (stewardship, care), for you are no longer able to be sochen.'

3. "And the sochen said to himself, `What may I do, because  my Adon takes away the pekuddat from me?  I am not strong enough to dig, I am ashamed to beg.

4. `Oh! I have da'as of what I may do, that when I am removed from the work of the sochen, they may receive me into their batim (houses).'

5. "And having summoned his Adon's debtors one by one, he was saying to the first, `How much do you owe Adoni?'

6. "And he said, `One hundred jugs of olive oil.'  And the sochen said to him, `Take your bill, sit down, quickly write fifty.'

7. "Then to another he said,`And you, how much do you owe?'  And he said, `One hundred containers of wheat.' He says to him, `Take your bill and write eighty.'

8. "And the Ba'al Bayit praised the unrighteous sochen because he acted with chochmah.  Because the Bnei HaOlam HaZeh have more saichel in dealing with their own generation than the Bnei HaOhr. [Tehillim 17:14; 18:26]

9. "And I say to you, use mammon to make for yourselves chaverim, so that when it fails, they may welcome you into the mishkenot olam.

10. "The one ne'eman (oisgehalten, trustworthy) in little, also is ne'eman in much, and the one who is unrighteous in little, also in much is unrighteous.

11. "If, then, you were not ne'eman with unrighteous mammon, who will entrust you with true riches?

12. "And if you were not ne'eman with that which belongs to another, who will give you what is your own?

13. "No eved is able to serve two adonim; for either he will have sin'ah (hatred) toward the one and he will have ahavah toward the other, or one he will be devoted to and the other he will despise. You are not able to serve Hashem and Mammon."

14. And the Perushim, who were ohavei kesef (lovers of money), heard all this and they made fun of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

15. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "You are the ones who in the sight of bnei Adam credit yourself as yitzdak im Hashem, but Hashem has da'as of your levavot.  Because the thing highly esteemed among bnei Adam is a to'eva (abomination) before Hashem.

16. "The Torah and the Nevi'im were proclaimed until Yochanan; vi-bahlt (since) then it is the Malchut Hashem that is being preached as Besuras HaGeulah, and anyone entering it must strive to do so.

17. "But it is easier for HaShomayim and HaAretz to pass away than for one tag (ornamental flourish) of the Torah to be dropped.

18. "Anyone giving the get to his isha and taking another wife  commits ni'uf (adultery), and the one marrying a gerusha (divorcee) commits ni'uf (adultery).
 THE MASHAL OF EL'AZAR AND THE ISH ASHIR

19. "Now there was a certain ish ashir (rich man).  He was dressed in purple and fine linen, and yom yom he feasted sumptuosly and every day for him was a simcha. [Yechezkel 16:49]

20. "And there was a certain evyon ish (poor man), a kaptzan covered with sores, El'azar by name, who had been laid at the rich man's gate.

21. "And the kaptzan El'azar longed to fill his stomach with what fell from the rich man's tish. But even the kelevim were coming and licking the kaptzan's sores.

22. "And it came to pass that El'azar died, and he was carried away by the malachim to the kheyk (bosom) of Avraham Avinu.  And then the ish ashir (rich man) died also, and he was buried.

23. "And lifting up his eynayim in She'ol, where he was in the torments of agony, he sees Avraham Avinu off in the distance and El'azar at his kheyk.

24. "And he called, `Avraham Avinu!  Chaneni na and send El'azar that he may dip the tip of his finger into the mayim and cool my leshon, because I am in torment in this moked (fire).'

25. "But Avraham Avinu said, `Beni, have zikaron that you received your tov in the chayyim of you, and El'azar likewise the ra'ah.  But now he is given nechamah (comfort) here, but you, yisurim (torments). [Tehillim 17:14]

26. "`And, in addition to all these things, there has been fixed between us and you a tehom gedolah (a great abyss, chasm), so that the ones wishing to come over from here to you are not able, neither from there to us may they cross over.'

27. "And he said, `I ask you then, Avraham Avinu, that you may send El'azar to the bais of Avi,

28. `for I have chamesh achim!--that he may warn them, lest also they may come to this place of yisurim (torments).'

29. "But Avraham Avinu says, `They have Moshe Rabbeinu and the Nevi'im.  Let them listen to them.'

30. "But he said, `Lo, Avraham Avinu, but if someone from the Mesim should go to them, they will make teshuva.

31. "But Avraham said to him, `If Moshe Rabbeinu and the Nevi'im they do not listen to, neither if someone from the Mesim should come back again will they be persuaded.'"

## Luke 17

1. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to his talmidim, "It is impossible for the nissayon to sin not to come, but oy through whom it comes.

2. "It is better for him if a millstone is hung around his neck  and he had been thrown into the sea than that he should cause a michshol (stumbling block) for these little ones.

3. "Pay attention to yourselves. If your ach sins and you rebuke him, and if he makes teshuva,  grant him selicha (forgiveness).

4. "And if shevah pe'amim (seven times) during the yom he sins against you and shevah pe'amim he turns around to you saying, `I make teshuva,' you will grant him selicha.

5. And the Shluchim said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu, "Increase our emunah."

6. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu said, "If you have emunah like a mustard seed, you would have said to this mulberry aitz, be uprooted and be planted in the sea, and it would have given you mishma'at.

7. "But who among you, having an eved plowing or tending kevesim, when he comes in from the sadeh, will say to him, `Here, come ofen ort (immediately) and recline at tish.'

8. "Rather, would he not say, `Prepare something that I may have okhel; gird up your tunic and serve me until I am satisfied, and after that, you may have okhel'?

9. "There is no obligatory effusive todah, when the eved only did his chiyuv (duty, what was commanded, that which one does to be yoitzeh).

10. "So also you, when you do all these things which are given you as mitzvot, say, `We are useless avadim, we only did our duty.'"  REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND PESACH IN YERUSHALAYIM; ONLY ONE OF THE ANASHIM METZORA'IM IS MAKIR OF MOSHIACH; THE MONUMENTAL INGRATITUDE OF THE AM YISROEL FOR THEIR REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH; BE MAKIR DO NOT LOOK FOR ANOTHER!

11. And it came about while Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach goes to Yerushalayim, he was traveling through the middle of Shomron and the Galil.

12. And entering into a certain shtetl, some anashim metzora'im (leprous men) met Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and there were asarah (ten) of them.  Keeping their distance, [Vayikra 13:45,46]

13. they shouted, saying, `Yehoshua, Moreinu, chaneinu!'

14. And having seen this, he said to them, `Go and show yourselves to the kohanim.' And it came about while they were going away that they were made metoharim (clean). [Vayikra 14:3]

15. And one of them, having seen that he had received refu'ah, returned with a kol gadol, saying "Baruch Hashem!"

16. And he fell on his face at the feet of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach giving todot.  And he was a Shomroni (Samaritan).

17. And in reply Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, "Were there not asarah (ten) who were made metoharim? Now the tishah (nine), where are they?"

18. "Was none of them found to return and to give kavod (glory) to Hashem except this nokhri (foreigner)?"

19. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Get up and go. Your emunah (faith) has delivered you."

20. Now having been asked by the Perushim, "When comes the Malchut Hashem?" he replied, "The Malchut Hashem is not coming with things observable,

21. nor will they say `Hinei, here it is,' or `There it is,' for hinei, the Malchut Hashem is within you."

22. And he said to the talmidim, "Yamim are coming when you will long to see one of the yamim of the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14) and you will not see it.

23. "They will say to you, `Hinei, there it is!' or, `Hinei, here it is!'  Do not go out after them nor pursue them.

24. "For as the lightning flashing out of one part under Shomayim lights up the other part under Shomayim, thus will be the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14) in his Yom.

25. "But b'rishonah it is necessary for him to suffer many things and to be rejected by HaDor HaZeh.

26. "And just as it was in the yamim of Noach, thus will it be also in the yamim of the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14). [Bereshis 6:5-8; 7:6-24]

27. "They were eating, drinking, marrying, and being given in marriage, until the yom when Noach entered into the Tevah (Ark) and haMabbul (the Flood) came and destroyed everything.

28. "Likewise, just as it was in the yamim of Lot. They were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, and building. [Bereshis 19:1-28]

29. "But on the yom when Lot went out from S'dom, from Shomayim it rained down aish and gofrit (sulphur) and destroyed everything.

30. "So it will be on the yom when the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14) is revealed.

31. "On that yom let not anyone on the rooftop come down back inside for any of his property in the bais, and the one in a sadeh likewise let him not turn back for things left behind.

32. "Have zikaron of the isha of Lot. [Bereshis 19:26]

33. "Whoever seeks to preserve his Chayyim will lose it, but whoever loses it, will preserve it.

34. "I say to you, in this lailah there will be two in one bed:  one will be taken and the other will be left.

35. "There will be two grinding at the same place: one will be taken, but the other will be left."

36.  

37. And in reply they say to him, "Where, Adoneinu?" But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Where the guf (body) is, there also the nesharim (vultures, eagles [popularly]) will be gathered together."

## Luke 18

1. Now he was speaking a mashal (parable) to them about how it is necessary always for them to daven and not to lose chozek, [Yeshayah 40:31]

2. Saying, "A certain dayan (judge) was in a certain shtetl. Now this dayan had no fear of Hashem nor any respect for bnei Adam.

3. "Now an almanah was in that shtetl and she was coming to him saying, "Grant me yashrus (justice) against my ish riv (opponent in a lawsuit). [Yeshayah 1:17]

4. "And for a zman he was not willing. But after these things he said to himself, `If indeed Hashem I do not fear nor bnei Adam I respect,

5. `yet because this almanah causes me tzoros and is such a nudge, I will grant yashrus (justice) to her, lest in the end she may wear me out by her constant coming.'"

6. Now Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu said, "Listen to what the unrighteous dayan says.

7. "Now will not Hashem by all means do mishpat for his Bechirim  crying out to him yomam valailah?  Will he delay long in bringing them help? [Shemot 22:23; Tehillim 88:1]

8. "I say to you that Hashem will bring about their mishpat swiftly, but when the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14) comes, will he then find emunah (faith) on ha'aretz?"
 WOE TO YOU WHEN YOU THINK YOU ARE ONE OF THE BAALEI BATIM (UPRIGHT AND RESPECTED PEOPLE) AND ONLY OTHERS ARE CHOTE'IM, NOT YOURSELF! YOUR PRAYER MUST BE, "ADONOY, RACHEM NA AL CHOTEH KAMONI!"

9. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said this mashal also to some, who have become soimech (confident, putting their trust and being dependent) on themselves that they are tzaddikim and who are despising others. [Yeshayah 65:5]

10. "Shnei anashim went up to the Beis Hamikdash to daven, one was a Perush and the other, a moches (tax-collector).

11. "The Perush was standing by himself, davening, and his tefillah went like this: `Adonoi, Modeh Ani that I am not like other men, swindlers, resha'im, mena'afim (adulterers), or even as this moches (tax-collector).

12. `I undergo a tzom (fast) twice during the week, I give the ma'aser (tithe) of everything as much as I get.' [Yeshayah 58:3, Malachi 3:8]

13. "But the moches (tax-collector) stood at a distance and was not willing even to lift up his eynayim to Shomayim but was beating his chest, saying, `Adonoi, rachem na al choteh kamoni! (L-rd, have mercy on a sinner like me!)' [Yeshayah 66:2; Yirmeyah 31:19]

14. "I say to you, this one, rather than the other one, went down to his bais having been made yitzdak im Hashem. Because everyone lifting himself up will be brought low, but the one bringing himself low will be uplifted."  REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH ON THE SUBJECT OF CHINUCH HABANOS (MT 19:13-15; MK 10:13-16)

15. Now also they were bringing to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach ollelim (infants) that he might place his hands on them. But having seen this, the talmidim were rebuking them.

16. But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach called for them saying, "Permit the yeladim to come to me and do not hinder them, for of such ones is the Malchut Hashem.

17. "Omein I say to you, whoever does not welcome the Malchut Hashem as a yeled, may by no means enter into it."


 REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND ONE OF THE BAALE-BATTIM OF YISROEL, WHO BECAUSE OF HIS LACK OF PERCEPTION OF TRUE RICHES, PASSES BY THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S S'MICHAH AND MINISTRY

18. And a certain one of the manhigim (leaders) questioned Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, Mori HaTov (Good Teacher), what mitzvah must I do to inherit Chayyei Olam?"

19. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Why do you call me tov? No one is tov except Hashem alone.

20. "You have da'as of the Mitzvot. LO TINAF, LO TIRTZACH, LO TIGNOV, LO TA'ANEH V'REI'ACHAH AD SHAKER, KABEID ES A'VICHA V'ES IMMECHAH." [Shemot 20:12-16; Devarim 5:16-20]

21. And he said, `In all these things I have been shomer mitzvot and frum from my kinder-yoren.'

22. And having heard, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Still one thing for you is lacking. Everything as much as you have, sell and distribute to the aniyim (poor), and you will have otzar (treasure) in Shomayim, and come follow me [Moshiach]."

23. But having heard these things he became very sad.  For he  had much kesef.

24. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, when he saw him become agmat nefesh, said, "How difficult it is for the ones having osher to enter into the Malchut Hashem. [Mishle 11:28]

25. "For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for an ish ashir to enter into the Malchut Hashem."

26. But the ones having heard said, "Then who is able to come to Yeshu'at Eloheinu?"

27. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "The things impossible with bnei Adam are possible with Hashem."

28. And Kefa said, "Hinei, we having left everything to follow you."

29. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Omein, I say to you, that there is no one who left bais or isha or achim or horim (parents) or yeladim because of the Malchut Hashem,

30. "who will not receive many times as much in this zman and in the Olam HaBah, Chayyei Olam."

 REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND HIS THIRD NEVU'AH CONCERNING HIS MAVET AND TECHIYAS HAMESIM; THE BINAH OF THIS NOT YET MEFURSAM (REVEALED) TO MOSHIACH'S TALMIDIM  (MT 20:17-19; MK 10:32-34)

31. And having taken the Shneym Asar aside in a yechidus, he said to them, "Hinei, we are making another aliyah leregel to Yerushalayim, and all the things having been written by the Nevi'im about the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14) will be fulfilled. [Yeshayah 53]

32. "For he (the Ben HaAdam Moshiach) will be delivered up to the goyim and he will be ridiculed and he will be mistreated and he will be spat upon,

33. and, having laid the shot (whip) on him, they will kill him and on the Yom HaShlishi there will be Moshiach's Techiyas HaMesim."

34. And they had chochma regarding none of these things and this dvar was nistar (concealed) from them, and they had no binah of the things being said.

 A MIRACLE: A JEWISH MAN ENABLED TO SEE REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH BEN DOVID (MT. 20:29-34; 10:46-52)

35. And it came about while Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach drew near to Yericho, a certain ivver was sitting beside the road begging.

36. And having heard a multitude traveling through, he was asking what this might be.

37. And they reported to him that Yehoshua of Natzeret is going by.

38. And he cried out saying, "Ben Dovid!  Chaneni!"

39. And the ones going past him were rebuking him that he should be silent, but he much more was crying out, "Ben Dovid, chaneni!"

40. And stopping, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach commanded the ivver to be led to him.  Having drawn near, he asked him, "What for you do you wish that I may do?"

41. And he said, "Adoni, that I may regain my sight."

42. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Regain your sight."  Your emunah (faith) has brought you refu'ah."

43. And at once he saw again and was following Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach shouting, "Baruch Hashem!" And all the people who were edey re'iyah (eyewitnesses) of this shouted, "Baruch HaShem!"

## Luke 19

1. And having entered, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was passing through Yericho.

2. And, hinei, a man by name Zakkai was there and he was a chief moches (tax-collector) and he was wealthy.

3. And he was seeking to catch a look at Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach  and was not able because of the multitude, and because in stature he was short.

4. And having run ahead to the front, he climbed up onto an aitz (tree), a sycamore, that he might see Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, because by that derech (way) he was about to pass by.  [Melachim Alef 10:27, Divrey Hayamim Alef 27:28, Yeshayah 9:10]

5. And as he came to the place, having looked up, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Zakkai, hurry and come down, for hayom in your bais it is necessary for me to remain."

6.  And having hurried, he came down and welcomed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach with simcha.

7. And everyone, having seen this, were beginning to kvetsh (complain), saying, "With a choteh he entered to rest."

8. And Zakkai stood there and said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu, "Hinei, half of my possessions, Adoni, I give as tzedakah to the aniyim, and if from someone I defrauded of anything I am paying back arbatayim (four times)." [Shemot 22:1, Vayikra 6:4,5; Bamidbar 5:7; Shmuel Bais 12:6; Yechezkel 33:14,15]

9. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Hayom Yeshu'at Eloheinu has come to this bais, because also he is a Ben Avraham."

10. "For the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14) came to seek and to save the lost." [Yechezkel 34:12,16]

11. Now as they were hearing these things, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach added a mashal (parable), because he was near to Yerushalayim and they had the havamina (assumption) that the Malchut Hashem was about to appear immediately.

12. Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "A certain man of noble birth traveled to a distant country to get for himself royal power for his malchut and to return.

13. "And having summoned aseret avadim of his, he gave them asarah minas and he said to them, `Conduct esek (business) until I come.'

14. "But his subjects were hating him and they sent a delegation after him saying, `We do not want this one to rule over us.'

15. "And it came about when he returned, having received the royal power of his malchut, he summoned to his presence these avadim to whom he had given the kesef, that he might have da'as of what they had gained by trading.

16. "And having come, the rishon (first) saying, `Adoni, with your mina asarah minas more were gained.'

17. `Yafeh asita, Eved tov, because you have been ne'eman in a very small thing, have shlita (authority) over eser shtetlach.' [Mishle 27:18]

18. "And the sheni (second) came saying, `Your mina, Adoni, made chamash minas.'

19. "And he said also to this one, `And you have shlita over chamash shtetlach.'

20. "And the other came saying, `Adoni, hinei!  Your mina which I had put away in a servetke (napkin).

21. `For I was fearing you, because you are a big machmir (stickler), you take what you did not deposit and you reap what you did not sow.'

22. "He says to him, `From your own mouth I will judge you,  eved rasha.  You had da'as that I am a big machmir (stickler), taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow?

23. `Why did you not then put my kesef into the bank?  Then when I came I would have collected ribit (interest).'

24. "And to the ones having stood nearby he said, `Take from him the mina and give it to the one having asarah minas.'

25. "And they said to him, `Adoneinu, he has asarah minas!'

26. `I say to you that to everyone having, more will be given, but from the one not having, even what he has will be taken away.

27. `But these oyevim of me, the ones not wanting me to have the shlita over them, bring them here and execute them before me.'"

28. And having said these things, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was traveling ahead making his aliyah leregel to Yerushalayim. 


 REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S TRIUMPHAL ENTRY INTO YERUSHALAYIM    (MT 21:1-11; MK 11:1-10; LK 19:28-38; JO 12:12-16; ZECH. 14:4)

29. And it came about as he came near to Beit-Pagey and Beit-Anyah to the Mount of Olives, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sent shnayim of the talmidim

30. saying, "Go to the shtetl ahead of you, in which entering you will find an AYIR having been tied, upon which none among bnei Adam ever sat, and having untied it, bring it here.

31. "And if someone asks you, `Why are you untying it?' you will say this, `Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu has need of it.'

32. And having departed, the ones having been sent found it just as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach told them.

33. And while untying the AYIR, its owners said to them, "Why are you untying the AYIR?"

34. And they said, "Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu has need of it."

35. And they led it to him and, having thrown their kaftans on the AYIR, they put Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach on it.

36. And as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach rode along, the people were spreading their garments on the road. [Melachim Bais 9:13]

37. And as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was now approaching the path that makes the descent from the Mount of Olives, all the multitude of the Rebbe's talmidim began with simcha to shout "Baruch Hashem!" with a kol gadol for all the nifla'ot and gevurot Hashem of which they had been edey re'iyah (eyewitnesses)

38. saying, "BARUCH HABAH, HaMelech B'SHEM ADONOI!  Shalom b'Shomayim!  And kavod in the Highest!" [Tehillim 118:26]

39. And some of the Perushim from the multitude said to him, "Rabbi, rebuke your talmidim!"

40. And in reply Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "I say to you if these will be silent, the avanim (stones) will cry out." [Chabakuk 2:11]

41. And as he came near, having seen the Ir, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach wept over it, [Yeshayah 22:4]

42. saying. "If you had only had da'as in HaYom HaZeh of the things leading to shalom, but now it was nistar (concealed) from your eyes.

43. "Because yamim will come upon you and your oyevim will construct a siege against you and they will surround you and will hem you in from all directions. [Yeshayah 29:3; Yirmeyah 6:6; Yechezkel 4:2; 28:6]

44. And they will dash you to the ground and your yeladim with you, and they will not leave an even (stone) upon an even (stone) within you, because you did not have da'as of the zman of your pekuddat (visitation)." [Tehillim 137:9]  REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH CLEANSES THE BEIS HAMIKDASH--THE AITZ TE'ENAH IS CURSED (MT 21:18-19; MT 11:12-18; LK 19:45-48)

45. And having entered into the Beis HaMikdash, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach began to throw out the sellers,

46. saying to them, "It has been written, BEITI BEIT TEFILLAH YIKAREI, but you made it a ME'ARAT PARITZIM. [Yeshayah 56:7; Yirmeyah 7:11]

47. And he was saying shiurim yom yom in the Beis Hamikdash. But the Rashei Hakohanim and the Sofrim were seeking to kill him and also the Rashei HaAm,

48. and they were not finding what they might do, for HaAm were all hanging on his every word.

## Luke 20

1. And it came about on one of the yamim Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying shiurim to HaAm in the Beis Hamikdash and was preaching the Besuras HaGeulah, and the Rashei Hakohanim and the Sofrim with the Ziknei HaAm stood by,

2. and they spoke, saying to him, "Tell us by what shlita (authority) you do these things, or who is the one having given to you this shlita (authority)?"

3. And in reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "I will also confront you will a sh'eilah, and you tell me:

4. "The tevilah of teshuva of Yochanan--was it from Shomayim or from bnei Adam?"

5. And they reasoned to themselves saying, "If we say, from Shomayim, he will say, why did you not believe him?

6. "But if we say, from bnei Adam, HaAm all will subject us to  sequilah (stoning), for HaAm Yisroel are all convinced that Yochanan is a navi."

7. And they answered that they did not have da'as of the origin of the tevilah of teshuva of Yochanan.

8. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Neither am I telling you by what shlita (authority) I do these things."

9. And he began to tell this mashal to HaAm Yisroel.  "A certain ish planted a kerem and leased it to koremim (vine-keepers) and he went away for a long time. [Yeshayah 5:1-7]

10. "And in season he sent to the koremim (vine-keepers) an eved that from the p'ri of the kerem they will give to him. But the koremim (vine-keepers) sent him away empty, having beaten him.

11. "And he proceeded to send another eved.  But him also, when they had beaten and dishonored him, they sent away empty.

12. "And he proceeded to send an eved shlishi. And also this one, having wounded, they threw out.

13. "And the Adon of the kerem, said, `What should I do?  I will send Beni Ahuvi.  Perhaps this one they will respect.'

14. "But having seen him, the koremim (vine-keepers) were reasoning with one another saying, `This one is the Bechor, the heir.  Let us kill him, that the bechorah may become ours.'

15. "And having driven him outside the kerem, they killed him.  What then will the Ba'al HaKerem do to them?

16. "He will come and will destroy these koremim (vine-keepers) and and will give the kerem to others."  And having heard this, HaAm Yisroel said, "Chas v'Shalom!"

17. But having looked at them, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "What then is this which has been written: EVEN MA'ASU HAY'TAH LEROSH PINAH ("The Stone they rejected became the capstone")? [Tehillim 118:22]

18. "Everyone having fallen upon that even (stone) will be broken into pieces, and upon whomever it falls, it will crush him" [Yeshayah 8:14,15; Daniel 2:34f]

19. And the Sofrim and the Rashei Hakohenim sought to lay their hands upon him in the same hour, but they were afraid of HaAm Yisroel, for they knew that he spoke against them this mashal (parable).  REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND HIS GAINSAYERS: AN ATTEMPT TO ENTRAP REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH CONCERNING TAXES AND CAESAR  (MT 22:15-22; MK 12:13-17; LK 20:20-26)

20. And having watched carefully, they sent spies pretending themselves to be tzaddikim, that they might catch him in his dvar, so as to deliver him to the rulers and the manhigim under the Moshel.

21. And they set a sh'eilah before Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, "Rabbi, we have da'as that you speak beemes (truly) in the shiurim you say and you show no deference toward anyone, but on the basis of HaEmes you give torah about HaDerech Hashem.

22. "Is it mutar (allowed) for us to pay tax to Caesar or not?"

23. But having noticed their arum (crafty) manner, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them,

24. "Show me a denarius.  Whose demut has it? And whose inscription?"  And they said, "Caesar's."

25. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Then give the things of Caesar to Caesar and the things of Hashem to Hashem."

26. And they were not able to catch him in his dvar before the people and, having marveled at his teshuvah (answer), they were silent.  THE SHEILAH (QUESTION) ABOUT THE TECHIYAS HAMESIM--A VAIN EFFORT TO CHALLENGE THE CHOCHMAH OF REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH  (MT 22:23-33; MK 12:18-27; LK 20:27-40)

27. And some of the Tz'dukim having approached (the Tz'dukim are the ones speaking against the Techiyas HaMesim who say it is not to be), they set a sheilah before him,

28. saying, "Rabbi, Moshe Rabbenu laid it down in writing to us, if someone's ach dies and has an isha, and UVEN EIN LO ("and there is no son to him"), that he should take the almanah of his ach and he should raise up a zera (seed) to his ach. [Devarim 25:5]

29. "Now there were shiva achim. And the first took an isha, and died UVEN EIN LO ("and there is no son to him").

30. "And the second

31. "and the third took her, and likewise also the seventh did not leave behind a ben and they all died.

32. "And lemaskana (finally) the isha died.

33. "The isha, then, in the Techiyas HaMesim, of which of them does she become the wife?

34. "For shiva had her as isha." And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "The banim of Olam Hazeh marry and are given in marriage,

35. "but the ones having been considered worthy to attain to the Olam HaBah and the Techiyas HaMesim neither marry nor are given in marriage.

36. "For neither is it possible any longer for them to die, for they are like malachim and they are bnei haElohim, being bnei haTechiyas HaMesim.

37. "But that the Mesim are made to stand up alive, even Moshe revealed at the burning bush, as he calls Adonoi ELOHEI AVRAHAM ELOHEI YITZCHAK V'ELOHEI YA'AKOV. [Shemot 3:6]

38. "But Hashem is not the G-d of Mesim but is Elohei HaChayyim, for to Hashem all are alive."

39. And in reply some of the Sofrim said, "Rabbi, you spoke well."

40. For no longer were they daring to set a sh'eilah before him regarding anything. REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH GIVES US THE TRUE DAAS TORAH INTERPRETATION OF TEHILLIM 110:1; REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH IS MORE THAN DOVID'S BEN, HE IS ALSO DOVID'S ADON  (MT. 22:41-46; MK 12:35-37; LK 20:41-44)

41. And he said to them, "How do they say that the Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach is to be Dovid's son?

42. "For Dovid himself says in the book of Tehillim, `NE'UM HASHEM L'ADONI: SHEV LIMINI,

43. `AD ASHIT OYVECHA L'RAGLECHA. [Tehillim 110:1]

44. "Therefore, if Dovid calls him Adon, how is he [merely] ben Dovid?" 
 REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH ATTACKS VAIN TRAPPINGS OF CHASHIVUT IN THE SHUL AS WELL AS ABUSES OF SAMCHUT   (MK 12:38-40; LK 20:45-47)

45. In the hearing of all the people, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to his talmidim,

46. "Beware of the Sofrim, the ones wanting to strut around in long kaftans and loving formal `Shalom' greetings in the market places and the rashei hamoshavot (chief seats) in the shuls and the places of kavod at seudot tishen,

47. "who devour the batim of the almanot and for the sake of appearance daven lengthy tefillos (prayers). The Din (Judgment) of them will be more severe."

## Luke 21

1. And having looked up, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach saw the ashirim putting into Beis Hamikdash Otzar (Treasury) their matanot (gifts).

2. And he saw a certain poor almanah putting in there two leptas.

3. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Omein, I say to you that this poor almanah put in more tzedakah than everyone.

4. "For all these from the things abounding to them put in matanot (gifts), but this almanah, out of her need, put in her michyah (subsistence)."  REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S HINT FOR MECHASHVEI KITSIN (RECKONERS OF THE END OF YAMIM, ESCHATOLOGISTS); THE GEULAH IS DESCRIBED  (MT 24:1-25:30; MK 13:1-37; LK 21:5-36)

5. And as some were speaking about the Beis Hamikdash that with beautiful avanim (stones) and with matanot (gifts) it has been decorated, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said,

6. "Yamim will come in which of these things which you see there will not be left an even (stone) upon an even (stone) which will not be thrown down."

7. And they questioned him, saying, "Rebbe, when therefore will  these things be and what will be the ot (miraculous sign) when these things are about to take place?"

8. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Beware, you should not be deceived. For many will come b'Shem of me saying, `I am he [I am the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach]. And, the time has drawn near.'  Do not follow after them.

9. "But whenever you hear about wars and intifadas, do not be a pachdan (coward). For it is necessary for these things to occur barishonah, but it is not immediately HaKetz."

10. Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying to them, "Ethnic group will have an intifada against ethnic group and malchut against malchut, [Divrey Hayamim Bais 15:6; Yeshayah 19:2]

11. "There will be great earthquakes and in various places ra'av and makkot, both horrible portents and great moftim in Shomayim. [Yeshayah 29:6; Yoel 2:30]

12. "But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and bring redifot on you, handing you over to the shuls and the batei hasohar, being led away before melachim (kings) and moshelim because of my name (Yehoshua/Yeshua).

13. "It will turn out for you to be an opportunity for edut (testimony).

14. "Therefore keep in your levavot not to prepare to defend yourselves.

15. "For I will give to you a peh and chochmah which they will not be able to resist or to contradict, all of your mitnaggedim (opponents).

16. "And you will be handed over also by horim and achim and kerovim and chaverim, and they will have some of you executed to die al kiddush ha-Shem,

17. "and you will be the focus of sinas chinam from everyone because of my name (Yehoshua/Yeshua).

18. "And not even a hair of your rosh will by any means perish.

19. "In your savlanut you will gain your nefashot (souls).

20. "But when you see Yerushalayim being surrounded by machanot (armies), then have da'as the devastation of it has drawn near.

21. "Then the ones in Yehudah, flee to the mountains and the ones inside HaIr, let them get out, and the ones in the sadot let them not enter into HaIr,

22. "Because these are the Yemei NaKam (Days of Vengeance) as a fulfillment of all the Kitvei Hakodesh. [Yeshayah 63:4; Daniel 9:24-27; Hoshea 9:7]

23. "Oy to the ones "with child" and to the ones nursing in  yamim hahem. For there will be Tzarah Gedolah upon Eretz Yisroel and ka'as (anger) against this people,

24. "and they will fall by the edge of the cherev and they will all be led captive into the Golus, and Yerushalayim will be trampled down by the goyim, until the times of the Goyim are fulfilled.  [Yeshayah 5:5; 63:18; Daniel 8:13]

25. "And there will be otot (miraculous signs) in the shemesh (sun) and the yare'ach (moon) and the kochavim (stars), and upon ha'aretz there will be dismay among the Goyim, in perplexity at the sound of the sea and the surf, and

26. "bnei Adam will be fainting from pachad and from expectation of the things coming upon the Olam Hazeh, for the kochot (powers) of the heavens will be shaken.

27. "And then you will see the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14) and his Bias HaMoshiach on an Anan with gevurah and  kavod rav.

28. "And when reshit of these things occurs, stand erect and lift up your roshim, because the Geulah of you draws near." THE MASHAL OF THE AITZ TE'ENAH; THE CHIDUSH (POINT) OF THE MASHAL IS THAT A TEKUMAH (REVIVAL) AMONG THE YEHUDIM SIGNALS HAKETZ OF THE OLAM HAZEH AND THE BIAS HAMOSHIACH

29. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach told a mashal (parable) to them. "You see the aitz te'enah (fig tree) and all the aitz.

30. "When they sprout leaves already, you see for yourselves and you have da'as that Kayits (Summer) is already near.

31. "So also you, when you see these things happening, you have da'as that the Malchut Hashem is near.

32. "Omein, I say to you, that HaDor HaZeh will not pass away until all these things may occur.

33. "HaShomayim and Ha'Aretz will pass away, but my dvarim will by no means pass away.

34. "And be shomer regarding yourselves lest your levavot may be burdened with dissipation and drunkenness and the cares of the Olam HaZeh and Yom HaHu may come upon you suddenly

35. "as a mokesh (trap).  For it will come upon all the ones dwelling on the pnei kol haAretz (the face of all the Earth).

36. "But be alert, always davening that you may be able to escape all these things that are about to happen and that you may be able to stand before the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14)." WHATEVER IS WITHOUT P'RI (FRUIT) IN REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH IS CURSED--THE WITHERED AITZ TE'ENAH AND THE POWER OF EMUNAH (MT 21:19-22; MK 11:19-26; LK 21:37-38)

37. Now in those days Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying shiurim in the Beis Hamikdash, and balailah he was going out  into the Mount of Olives.

38. "And all the people were getting up early in the boker to come to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach in the Beis Hamikdash to hear him."

## Luke 22

1. And the Chag HaMatzot was approaching, the feast called Pesach.

2. And the Rashei Hakohanim and the Sofrim were seeking how they might destroy him, for they were afraid of the people. BETRAYING THE REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH: THE ACT OF YEHUDAH FROM K'RIOT  (MT 26:14-16; MK 14:10-11; LK 22:3-6)

3. And Hasatan entered into Yehudah, the one being called Yehudah from K'riot, being one of the Shneym Asar.

4. And having departed, Yehudah spoke with the Rashei Hakohanim and Guard of the Beis Hamikdash how he might hand him over to them.

5. And they got a lot of geshmak out of this, and they agreed to pay him kesef. [Zecharyah 11:12]

6. And Yehudah consented and he was seeking an opportunity to betray him when there was no multitude with them. PREPARING FOR PESACH WITH REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH  (MT 26:17-20; MK 14:12-17; LK 22:7-30)

7. Shoin (already) now came the Yom HaMatzot, in which it was necessary to sacrifice the Pesach Korban, the Seh (Lamb, Yeshayah 53:7). [Shemot 12:18-20; Devarim 16:5-8]

8. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sent Kefa and Yochanan having said, "Go and make our preparations that we may eat and have the Pesach Seder."

9. And they said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Where do you wish that we should prepare it?"

10. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Hinei!  When you enter into HaIr, you will meet a man carrying a jar of mayim. Follow him into the bais into which he enters,

11. "And you will say to the Ba'al Bayit, `The Rabbi says to you, Where is the mekom linah (guest room) where I may conduct the Pesach Seder with my talmidim?'

12. "And that one will show you a large upstairs cheder (room) having been furnished.  There prepare the Seder."

13. And having departed they found things just as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had told them and they prepared the Seder.

14. And when the hour came, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach reclined at tish and the Moshiach's Shluchim were with him.

15. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "With great tshuka (deep and sincere desire) I have desired to eat this Pesach with you before I suffer.

16. "For I say to you that I may by no means eat it until it is fulfilled in the Malchut Hashem."   REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S FINAL HAMOTZI AND BERAKHAH AT HIS SEUDAH (MT 26:26-29; MK 14:22-25; LK 22:17-20)  THE FINAL KIDDUSH IN ZACHOR (REMEMBRANCE) OF REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH WHOSE TZAVVAAH (LAST WILL) IS THE BRIT CHADASHA KAPPARAH FOR OUR SELICHA (FORGIVENESS) AND DEVEKUS (COMMUNION WITH G-D)

17. And having taken a [Kiddush Cup) kos, having made the beracha, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Take this and share it among yourselves,

18. "For I say to you that by no means may I drink from now from the p'ri hagefen until the Malchut Hashem comes."

19. And having taken matzah and having made the ha-Motzi, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach offered the betzi'at halechem and gave it to them, saying, "This is my guf (body) being given for you; this do in zikaron of me. [Vayikra 5:7; 6:23; Yechezkel 43:21; Yeshayah 53:8]

20. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach took the kos (cup) similarly after they ate, saying, "This kos (cup) is HaBrit HaChadasha in my dahm being shed for you."  [Shemot 24:8; Yeshayah 42:6; Yirmeyah 31:31-34; Zecharyah 9:11]     THE NAMING OF THE BETRAYER  (MT 26:21-25; MK 14:18-21; LK 22:21-23; JO 13:21-30)

21. "Nevertheless, hinei!  The hand of the one betraying me is with me on the tish [Tehillim 41:9]

22. "Because the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14) indeed goes according to the thing having been determined, but oy to that man through whom he is betrayed."

23. And they began to discuss among themselves who then it might be among them that would do this.

24. And there came about also a dispute among them, as to which of them seemed to be greater.

25. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "The melachim (kings) of the Goyim domineer them and the ones having shlita over the goyim are called "benefactors."

26. "But with you it is not so, but he of the Gedolim among you, let him be as the youngest, and he of the Manhigim, as the one serving.

27. "For who is haGadol?  The one reclining at tish or the one serving? Is it not the one reclining at tish?  But I am in your midst as one serving.

28. "But you are the ones having remained with me in the my nisyonot (temptations).

29. "And I assign shlita to you, just as Avi assigned shlita to me--a malchut (kingdom),

30. "that you may eat and drink at my tish in my Malchut, and you will sit upon kissot judging the Shneym Asar Shivtei Yisroel.   REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S TALMIDIM TOLD THAT THEY WILL MAKE DENIAL OF REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH   (MT 26:31-35; MK 14:27-31; LK 22:31-38)

31. "Shimon, Shimon, hinei!  Hasatan asked for you, to sift you like wheat [Iyov 1:6-12; Amos 9:9]

32. "But I davened for you, that your emunah may not fail. And when you have made teshuva, give chizzuk to your Achim b'Moshiach.

33. But Shimon Kefa said to him, "Adoni, with you I am prepared even to go to the beis hasohar, even to die al kiddush ha-Shem."

34. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "I say to you a tarnegol (cock) will not crow hayom until shlosh pa'amim you, Kefa, will  make hakhchashah (denial) to have da'as of me."

35. He said to them, "When I sent you without a money belt and a  bag and sandals, did you lack anything?" And they said, "Nothing."

36. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "But now the one having a money belt, let him take it; likewise also a bag; and the one not having, let him sell his kaftan and let him buy a cherev.

37. "For I say to you, that it is necessary that what stands written be fulfilled in me, V'ES POSHE'IM NIMNAH ("and with lawless persons he was numbered" Yeshayah 53:12).  For indeed what was written about me is being fulfilled."

38. And they said, "Adoni, hinei!  Here are shtei charavot (two swords)."  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "It is enough." 
 THE FINAL TEMPTATION OF REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH (MT 26:36-40; MK 14:32-42; JO 18:1)

39. And having gone out he went according to his kvius (regimen) to the Mount of Olives, and his talmidim followed him also.

40. And having come to the place, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Daven and offer tefillos, lest you enter lidey nisayon."

41. And he had withdrawn from them about a stone's throw and having fallen down he was davening,

42. saying, "Avi, im yirtzeh Hashem, if you are willing, take this kos (cup) away from me.  Nevertheless not the ratzon of me but r'tzonechah (thy will) be done." (Mt.6:10)

43. And a malach min HaShomayim appeared to him, strengthening him.

44. And having been in agony, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was davening more fervently; and his sweat became like drops of blood falling down upon the ground.

45. And having got up from davening and having come to the talmidim, he found them sleeping, because of agmat nefesh.

46. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Why are you sleeping? Get up, daven, lest you enter lidey nisayon.


 THE HANDING OVER OF THE SEH HAELOHIM, REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH THE PESACH KORBAN  (MT 26:47-56;  MK 14:43-52; LK 22:47-53; JO 18:2-12)

47. Yet as he was speaking, hinei, a multitude!  And going at their head was the one being called Yehudah, one of the Shneym Asar, and he drew near to Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach to give him a neshikah (kiss).

48. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Yehudah, do you with a neshikah the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14) betray?"

49. But having seen what was coming, the ones around Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Adoni, should we strike with the cherev?"

50. And a certain one of them struck the eved of the Rashei Hakohanim and cut off his right ear.

51. And, in reply, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, "Blaib shtein! (Stop!) No more of this!" And having touched the ear, he healed him.

52. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to the ones having come against him, the Rashei Hakohenim and the Beis Hamikdash shomrim and the Ziknei HaAm, "Do you have the chutzpah to come out as against a ganav with charavot and clubs?

53. "Yom Yom I was with you in the Beis Hamikdash and you did not stretch out your hands against me, but this is your hour and the shlita of choshech (power of evil, sitra ahra)." REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH BEFORE THE SANHEDRIN, THE BEGINNING OF HIS TZA'AR (PAIN AND SUFFERING): CONDEMNED ON THE BASIS OF PERJURED EDUT   (MT 26:57-68; MK 14:53-65; LK 22:54, 63-65; JO 18:24) KEFA MAKES HAKHCHASHAH (DENIAL) OF REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH     (MT 26:58, 69-75; 14:54,66-72; LK 22:54-62; JO 18:15-18,25-27)

54. And having seized Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, they led him away and brought him into the bais of the Rashei Hakohanim. And Kefa was following from a distance.

55. And some kindled a hadlakah (bonfire) in the middle of the courtyard, and having sat down together, Kefa was sitting in their midst.

56. And a certain shifcha (woman servant), seeing him sitting in the light of the hadlakah, stared intently at Kefa and said, "And this one was with him."

57. But Kefa denied it saying, "I do not have da'as of him, isha."

58. And after a short while, another, having seen him, said, "And you are of them!"  But Kefa said, "Ben Adam, I am not!"

59. And about one hour had passed, and still another was insisting, saying, "Beemes this one was with him also, for he also is a Gelili (inhabitant of the Galil)!"

60. But Kefa said, "Ben Adam, I do not have da'as what you are saying."  And immediately, while Kefa was speaking, a tarnegol  crowed.

61. And having turned, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu looked at Kefa, and Kefa was reminded of the dvar of Moshiach Adoneinu when he said to him, "Before the tarnegol crows hayom you will make hakhchashah (denial) of me shalosh pe'amim."

62. And having gone outside Kefa wept bitterly.

63. And the men, the ones having Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach in custody were ridiculing him and beating him.

64. And having blindfolded him, they were setting a sh'eilah in front of him, saying, "Give a dvar nevu'ah, who is the one having given you a klap (blow)?"

65. And with much other Chillul Hashem gadfanut they were speaking against Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

66. And when boker came, the Ziknei HaAm were gathered together, both the Rashei Hakohanim and the Sofrim, and they led him away to their Sanhedrin,

67. saying, "If you are the Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, tell us."  But he said to them, "If I say this to you, you will by no means have emunah.

68. "And if I set a sh'eilah before you, you will by no means give teshuvah.

69. "But from now on the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14) will be YOSHEV LIMIN as the gevurat Hashem. (Tehillim 110:1)

70. And everyone said, "Then you are the Ben HaElohim?"  Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "You are saying that I am."

71. And to them they said, "Why still do we have need of a ed (witness)?  For we ourselves heard from his peh (mouth)."

## Luke 23

1. And the whole multitude of them got up and led Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach before Pilate.

2. And they began to accuse him saying, "This one we found misleading our nation and making it asur (forbidden) to pay taxes to Caesar and calling himself Moshiach and that he is to be a Melech."

3. And Pilate cross-examined Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, "Are you the Melech HaYehudim?" And in reply Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "You say so."

4. And Pilate said to the Rashei Hakohanim and the multitudes, "I find no ashmah (guilt) in this man."

5. But they were insisting, saying, "He incites the people, from where he began with his torah, throughout all of Yehudah, from the Galil even to this place." REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH IS SENT TO HEROD THE KING; THOUGH IT IS PESACH AND NOT YOM KIPPUR, REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH FULFILLS A YOM KIPPUR MOTIF IN THE QUESTION OF KAPPARAH IN TWO "SONS OF THE FATHER," ONE FOR HASHEM, ONE FOR AZAZEL (VAYIKRAH 16:6-9); MOSHIACH MA SHE-EIN KEIN BAR-ABBA

6. And when Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Gelili (an inhabitant of the Galil).

7. And having learned that, that he is under the jurisdiction of Herod, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Yerushalayim during those days.

8. And Herod, having laid eyes on Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, had great simcha.  For he was for a long time wanting to see him, because he keeps hearing things about him and he was hoping to watch some ot (miraculous sign) being performed by him.

9. And Herod was questioning Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach with many words, but Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answered him nothing.

10. And the Rashei Hakohenim and the Sofrim had stood by vehemently accusing Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

11. And having treated him with contempt, Herod with his chaiyalim (soldiers) also ridiculed him, having clothed him in an elegant royal robe.  So they thus sent back him to Pilate.

12. And Herod and Pilate became fast friends with one another on that very day, for they were previously at enmity toward each other.

13. And Pilate, when he had assembled the Rashei Hakohenim and the manhigim and the people,

14. said to them, "You brought to me this man causing the people to revolt, and, hinei, I have cross-examined him before you and I found nothing in this man of the crime of which you make accusations against him.

15. "And neither did Herod, for he sent back him to us, and, hinei, nothing worthy of mavet has been done by him.

16. "Therefore, having disciplined him, I will release him."

17.  

18. But they cried out with one kol, saying, "Away with this one!  And release to us Bar-Abba!"

19. (Bar-Abba was a man who was thrown into the beis hasohar, because of some insurrection which occurred in HaIr as well as a retzach [murder].)

20. And again Pilate addressed them, wishing to release Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach.

21. But they were crying out saying, "Let him be hanged on HaAitz!  Let him be hanged on HaAitz!" [Devarim 21:22]

22. And a pa'am shlishit, Pilate said to them, "But what ra'ah did this one do?  No crime worthy of mavet did I find in him. Therefore, having disciplined him I will release him."

23. But they insisted with a kol gadol demanding him to be hanged on the aitz and their voices were roiv prevailing.

24. And Pilate decided that their demand be accomplished.

25. And he released the one they were requesting, the one who had been thrown into the beis hasohar on account of an insurrection and retzach, but Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach he delivered over to their ratzon.   A PICTURE OF THE TALMID OF MOSHIACH: ONE PRESSED INTO SERVICE TO HELP BEAR REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S AITZ   (MT 27:31-34; MK 15:20-23; LK 23:26-33; JO 19:16-17)

26. And as they led him away, having seized a certain Shimon, a Cyrenian, coming in from the country, they put upon him Moshiach's aitz to carry, following Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach.

27. And a great multitude of HaAm were following him and nashim who were acting as avelim (mourners) lamenting for him.

28. And having turned to them, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, "Banot HaYerushalayim, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves  and for your yeladim,

29. "because, hinei, yamim are coming in which they will say, `Ashrey are the barren and the wombs which did not bear and the breasts which did not nurse.'

30. "Then they will begin to say to the mountain, `Fall on us!' and to the hills, `Bury us.' [Hoshea 10:8; Yeshayah 2:19]

31. "Because if while an aitz (tree) is green they do these things, what may happen when it is dry?" [Yechezkel 20:47]

32. And two criminals were also being led away with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to be executed. [Yeshayah 53:12] THE HAGBA (LIFTING UP) OF REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH  (MT 27:35-50; MK 15:24-37; LK 23:33-46; JO 19:18-30)

33. And when they came upon the place being called "The Skull," there they hanged each on his aitz, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and the criminals, one on the right, and one on the left.

34. But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was saying, "Abba, grant selicha to them, for they have no da'as of what they are doing." And dividing up his garments, VAPPILU GORAL ("they cast lots"). [Tehillim 22:19(18)]

35. And HaAm had stood watching. And the manhigim were mocking him also, saying, "Others he saved, let him save himself, if this one is the Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach of Hashem, the Bechir Hashem." [Tehillim 22:17; Yeshayah 42:1]

36. And the chaiyalim (soldiers) also ridiculed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach as they approached, offering CHOMETZ ("wine vinegar" Tehillim 69:21) to him, [Tehillim 22:7]

37. and saying, "If you are HaMelech HaYehudim, save yourself."

38. And there was also an inscription over him, THIS IS HAMELECH HAYEHUDIM."

39. And one of the criminals having been hanged with him was speaking Chillul Hashem gadfanut against him, saying, "Are you not the Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach?

40. "Save yourself and us." And in reply the other, rebuking him, said, "Do you not have yirat Shomayim?  For you are under the same gezar din (verdict) of haresha'ah (condemnation as guilty)?

41. "And this is a just gezar din against us, for we deserve what we are getting for our ma'asim.  But this one did nothing rah."

42. And he was saying, "Yehoshua, remember me when you come into your Malchut."

43. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Omein I say to you, hayom with me you will be in Gan-Eden."

44. And it was already about the sixth hour [noon] and choshech (darkness) was over the whole land until the ninth hour. [Amos 8:9]

46. And having cried out with a kol gadol, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, "Abba, B'YADCHA AFKED RUCHI ("Into your hands I commit my ruach" Tehillim 31:6(5)). And this having said, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach breathed out his last. [Tehillim 31:5]

47. And the centurion who saw the thing that happened was saying, "Baruch Hashem, surely this man was a Tzaddik."

48. And when all the crowds that had assembled at this spectacle had observed the things that had happened, they went away beating  their chests.

49. And all his acquaintances stood at a distance and the nashim, the ones following him from the Galil, observed these things [as edey re'iyah, eyewitnesses].

50. And, hinei, a man by name Yosef being a member of Sanhedrin, and an ish tov and a tzaddik

51. (this one had not consented to their cheshbon [plan] and  action) came from Ramatayim, a shtetl of Yehudah.  He was waiting expectantly for the Malchut Hashem.

52. He approached Pilate, and asked for the guf Yehoshua. [Tehillim 16:9-10; Iyov 19:25-27; Yeshayah 53:11]

53. And, having taken down the guf (body), he wrapped it in a linen [tachrichim] and placed it in a hewn kever (tomb) where not anyone was yet been laid. [Tehillim 16:9-10; Iyov 19:25-27; Yeshayah 53:11]

54. And it was nearly Erev Shabbat, Shabbos was drawing near.  

 THE CHEVRAH KADDISHA STANDS BY GUARDING THE GUF AT THE KEVER (MT 27:61-66; MK 15:47; LK 23:55-56)

55. And following along after, the nashim who had come out of the Galil with him, saw the kever (tomb) and how his guf (body was laid.  [Bereshis 47:18; Tehillim 16:9-10; Iyov 19:25-27; Yeshayah 53:11]

## Luke 24

1. But on Yom HaRishon, the first day of the shavu'a (week) very early in the boker, they went to the kever (tomb) bringing what spices they prepared.

2. But they found the even (stone) having been rolled away from the kever (tomb),

3. and, having entered, they did not find the guf (body) of the Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu.  [Tehillim 16:9-10; Iyov 19:25-27; Yeshayah 26:19; 53:11]

4. It came about while they uncertain about this, indeed, hinei, shnei (two), garmented in dazzling robes, stood by them.

5. And having become terrified, the nashim bowed their faces to the ground.  They said to the nashim, "Why are you seeking haChai (the One living) among HaMesim?

6. "He is not here, he kam (stood up) litechiyyah (to come to life again). Have zikaron how he spoke to you while he was still in the Galil,

7. saying, `It is necessary for the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14) to be delivered over into the hands of anashim chote'im  and to be hanged on HaAitz [Devarim 21:22] and on HaYom HaShlishi to stand up alive again.'"

8. And they remembered the words of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

9. And having returned from the kever (tomb), they reported all these things to the Achad Asar (the Eleven) and to all the others.

10. Now there were Miryam of Magdala and Yochanah and Miryam the Em (mother) of Ya'akov, and the others with them. They were telling the Moshiach's Shluchim these things,

11. and these words of theirs appeared to the Moshiach's Shluchim as utter narrishkeit, and the Shluchim had no emunah in what they said.

12. Kefa got up and ran to the kever (tomb).  And when he bent over, Kefa sees the tachrichim linen cloths only, and he departed wondering to himself with tzorich iyun (unresolved puzzlement) about the thing that had happened.  TWO TZUBROCHENE (SAD, WITH EXPECTIONS CRUSHED) TALMIDIM ON THE ROAD TO AMMA'US

13. And, hinei, shnayim (two) of them that same day were traveling to a shtetl being distant sixty stadia from Yerushalayim, a shtetl to which is the name Amma'us.

14. And they were speaking to one another concerning all these things that had happened.

15. And it came about while they were talking and discussing these things that also Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach himself had come near and was traveling along with them,

16. But the eynayim (eyes) of them were prevented from recognizing Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

17. And he said to them, "What words are these which you are exchanging with one another as you are walking along?" And they stood with a look of agmat nefesh (tzubrochen, broken-hearted).

18. And in reply one, Cleopas by name, said to him, "Are you the only one visiting Yerushalayim that does not have da'as of the things that have happened in it in these days?"

19. And he said to them, "What things?" And they said to him.  "The things about Yehoshua from Natzeret, who was a man, a navi, powerful in ma'aseh and dvar before Hashem and all HaAm,

20. "and how both our Rashei Hakohenim and minhagim delivered him over to a condemnation of mavet and how on HaAitz they hanged him.[Devarim 21:22]

21. "But we were holding the tikvah that he is the one to bring the Geulah of Yisroel.  Ken, and besides all this, it is now HaYom HaShlishi vi-bahlt (since) these things took place.

22. "Also some nashim in our number astounded us. They came to the kever (tomb) early this morning,

23. "and not having found the guf (body) of him, they came saying also to have seen a chazon (vision, appearance) of malachim who say he lives. [Bereshis 47:18; Tehillim 16:9-10; Iyov 19:25-27; Yeshayah 53:11]

24. "And some of the ones with us departed to the kever (tomb), and they found it so, just as also the nashim said, but him they did not see."

25. And he said to them, "O foolish ones and slow in lev (heart) to have emunah in all which the Nevi'im spoke.

26. "Was it not necessary for the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to suffer these things and to enter into his kavod (glory)?"

27. And having begun from Moshe Rabbenu and from all the Nevi'im, he explained to them in all the Kitvei Hakodesh the things concerning himself. [Bereshis 3:15; Bamidbar 21:9; Devarim 18:15; Yeshayah 7:14; 9:6; 40;10,11; 53; Yechezkel 34:23; Daniel 9:24; Michoh 7:20; Malachi 3:1]

28. And they drew near to the shtetl where they were traveling and he acted as though to travel vaiter (farther).

29. And they strongly urged him saying, "Stay with us, because it is towards erev and the yom has declined already." And he entered to stay with them.

30. And it came about, while he was reclining at tish with them, having taken the matzot, he made the ha-Motzi, and, having offered the betzi'at halechem, he was giving it to them.

31. And the eynayim of them were opened, and they had da'as, recognizing him.  And just then he became invisible from them.

32. And they said to one another, "Were not our levavot burning within us as he was speaking to us on the derech, as he was opening to us the Kitvei Hakodesh?"

33. And getting up that very hour they returned to Yerushalayim, and they found the Achad Asar and their chaverim gathered together,

34. saying that "Be'emes (really, tahke) Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu was mamash (genuinely) made to stand up alive and he appeared to Shimon."

35. And they were explaining the things on the derech and how he was made known to them in the betzi'at halechem.

36. And while they were speaking these things, he stood in the midst of them and he says to them, "Shalom Aleichem."

37. But having been startled and having been terrified, they were thinking they saw a ruach (spirit).

38. And he said to them, "Why have you been troubled, and why do doubts arise in your levavot?

39. "You see my hands and my feet that I am myself.  Touch me and see, because a ruach does not have basar and atzamot (bones)  as you see me having."

40. And having said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.

41. And while in their simcha they were still disbelieving and astonished, he said to them, "Have you some okhel here?"

42. And they gave him part of a broiled dag (fish).

43. And having taken it, in front of them, he ate it.

44. And he said to them, "These are my dvarim which I spoke to you while still being with you, that it is necessary that all the things having been written in the Torah of Moshe [Rabbenu] and the Nevi'im and the Tehillim about me to be fulfilled." [Tehillim 2; 16; 22; 69; 72; 89; 110; 118;]

45. Then he opened their minds to have binah of the Kitvei Hakodesh.

46. And he said to them, "Thus it has been written, that the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach must suffer and come back to life again from HaMesim on HaYom HaShlishi,

47. "and teshuva for the selicha (forgiveness) of chatta'im (sins) is to be preached b'Shem of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to all the Nations, beginning from Yerushalayim. 

 THE PROMISE OF THE TEVILAH IN THE RUACH HAKODESH GIVEN TO REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S TALMIDIM, THAT THEY WILL HAVE POWER AND  WEAPONS OF THE RUACH HAKODESH TO BE HIS WITNESSES IN A RESISTANT AND REBELLIOUS OLAM HAZEH AND TO TAKE REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S BESURAS HAGEULAH TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH (SEE HOW IN THE BOOK OF ACTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES THE TALMIDIM ARE MADE TO "SIT" BY MOSHIACH'S SHLUCHIM AND BE REGULARIZED WITH THIS POWER)

48. "You are to be edim (witnesses) of these things.

49. "And, hinei, I send the havtachah of Avi to you; but you sit in HaIr (the City [of Yerushalayim]) until you may be clothed with oz (power) from on High."  REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH IS TAKEN UP TO SHOMAYIM  (MK 16:19-20; ACTS 1:9-11)

50. And he led them outside as far as Beit-Anyah, and having lifted up his hands, he said a berakhah over them.

51. And it came about, while he said the berakhah over them, he departed from them, and was being taken up in an aliyah to Shomayim.

52. And they, having reverenced him in worship [Daniel 7:14; 3:18], returned to Yerushalayim with simcha gedolah.

53. And they were continually in the Beis Hamikdash praising Hashem.
