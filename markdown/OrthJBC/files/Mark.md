## Mark 1

1. [The] beginning of the Besuras HaGeulah (the Good News of Redemption) of Yehoshua, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach [the] Ben HaElohim.   YOCHANAN OF THE TEVILAH OF TESHUVA COMES AS MOSHIACH'S MAGGID IN THE MIDBAR (MT. 3:1-12; MK 1:2-8; LK 3:3-18)

2. Just as it has been written in Yeshayah HaNavi, HINNENI SHOLEIACH MALACHI ("Behold, I send my messenger") before your face, UPINNAH DERECH LEFANAI ("and he will prepare the way before me," [SHEMOT 23:20; MALACHI 3:1]), he will prepare your way.

3. KOL KOREY BAMIDBAR ("A voice of one shouting in the wilderness," TARGUM HASHIVIM YESHAYAH 40:3): `Prepare the Derech Hashem (the way of the L-rd). Make his paths yashar (straight)!'"

4. Yochanan came with a mikveh mayim in the midbar (wilderness), preaching a tevilah of teshuva for the selichat avon (forgiveness/pardon of sins).

5. And all Yehudah and all Yerushalayim were going out to him, and they were submitted to a tevilah using the Yarden River as a mikveh mayim, making vidduy (confession) [to Hashem] of their averos (sins).

6. And Yochanan had camel-hair clothing and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was arbe (locusts) and devash (wild honey). [Melachim Bais 1:8; Vayikra 11:22]

7. And he was preaching, crying out as a maggid (preacher) [for the Moshiach], saying, "Hu Habah (He who Comes, i.e. Moshiach) after me is more powerful than me. I am not worthy to stoop down and remove his sandals.

8. I give you a tevilah in a mikveh mayim, but he (Moshiach) will give you a tevilah in the Ruach Hakodesh." [Yeshayah 44:3; Yoel 2:28]  MOSHIACH'S TEVILAH IN THE MIKVEH MAYIM OF THE YARDEN RIVER (MT.3:13-17; MK 1:9-11; LK 3:21-23)

9. And it was during that period that Yehoshua from Natzeret of the Galil came and submitted to Yochanan's tevilah in the mikveh mayim of the Yarden.

10. And ofen ort (immediately) Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came up out of the mikveh mayim, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach saw the Shomayim being torn open and the Ruach Hakodesh of Hashem descending like a yonah (dove) upon him.

11. And there was a bat kol out of Shomayim, ATAH BNI AHUVI ASHER B'CHA CHAFATSTI ("You are my Son, the beloved, with whom I am well pleased"). [Bereshis 22:2; Tehillim 2:7; Yeshayah 42:1]  HASATAN STANDS UP AGAINST MOSHIACH: THE TEMPTATION (MT.4:1-11; MK1:12-13; LK 4:1-13)

12. Then the Ruach Hakodesh ofen ort (immediately) thrusts Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach out into the midbar.

13. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was in the midbar arba'im yom v'arba'im lailah, undergoing temptation by Hasatan; and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was with the chayyat hassadeh (wild beasts, IYOV 5:23), and the malachim were the meshartei Hashem ministering to Moshiach (YOEL 1:9; TEHILLIM 91:11). [Shemot 24:18; Melachim Alef 19:8]
 MOSHIACH RETURNS TO THE GALIL (MT.4:12; MK 1:14; LK 4:14; JO 4:43-45)

14. Now after Yochanan was arrested, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came to the Galil, proclaiming the Besuras HaGeulah of Hashem,     
 MOSHIACH THE MAGGID OF TESHUVAH (MT.4:17; MK 1:15; LK 4:15)

15. and saying, "The appointed time has been fulfilled and the Malchut Hashem has come near. Make teshuva, and have emunah in the Besuras HaGeulah."  MOSHIACH'S KEHILLAH BEGINS TO FORM IN THE GALIL, WITH ITS ROSH HAEDAT AND MANHIG, REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH, SURROUNDED BY MOSHIACH'S SHLUCHIM FISHING THE OLAM HAZEH: MOSHIACH SUMMONS THE DAIYAGIM (MT.4:18-22; MK 1:16-20; LK 5:1-11)

16. And passing along beside Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee), Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach saw Shimon and Andrew, the brother of Shimon, casting a net into the sea, for they were daiyagim (fishermen).

17. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Come, follow me [as my talmidim], and I will make you to become daiyagei adam (fishers of men)."

18. And ofen ort (immediately), leaving their nets, they followed Moshiach.

19. And going on a little, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach saw Ya`akov Ben-Zavdai and Yochanan his brother, who were also in the sirah (boat) repairing the nets.

20. And ofen ort (immediately) Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach summoned them; and, leaving Zavdai their father in the sirah (boat) with the sachirim (hired workers), they went away to follow Moshiach [as his talmidim].  SHABBOS IN K'FAR-NACHUM (MT 8:14-17; MK 1:21-34; LK 4:32-41)

21. And they enter into K'far-Nachum, and ofen ort (immediately) on Shabbatot, entering into the shul, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach exercised the ministry of moreh (teacher).

22. And they were astounded at Moshiach's torah (teaching), for he was teaching them as one having samchut (authority), and not as the Sofrim (Scribes/torah teachers, rabbonim). 
 THE REFUAH SHELEMAH (COMPLETE HEALING) REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH BRINGS--THE BEGINNING OF MOSHIACH'S MA'ASIM TOVIM (GOOD DEEDS) AND NISSIM (MIRACLES)

23. And, ofen ort (immediately), there was in their shul a man with a ruach hatameh (unclean spirit, shed/demon/evil spirit), and he shouted,

24. saying, "Yehoshua of Natzeret, mah lanu v'lach?" ("What to us and to you?" Melachim Alef 17:18) Have you come to bring us churban (destruction)? I have da'as [of the raz, secret/mystery of] who you are, HaKadosh of Hashem (the Holy One of G-d, YESHAYAH 49:7)!"  [Shofetim 13:5, Yeshayah 41:14,16,20]

25. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach rebuked the shed, saying, "Shekit! Geitzich! And come out of him."

26. And, the ruach hatameh, throwing him into convulsions, let out a shrai (scream) and came out of him.

27. And all were astounded so that they began to discuss with each other, saying, "What is this?  Torah Chadasha with samchut?  He gives orders to the shedim and they obey him?"

28. And the besuroh (news) of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach ofen ort (immediately) went forth everywhere into the surrounding region of the Galil.

29. And ofen ort (immediately), coming out of shul, they went into the bais (house) of Shimon and Andrew with Ya'akov and Yochanan.

30. And the chamot (mother-in-law, shviger) of Shimon was bedridden and fever-stricken, and ofen ort (immediately) they tell Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach about her.

31. And approaching, holding her hand, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach lifted her up, and the kaddachat (fever, DEVARIM 28:22) left her, and she then began functioning as their mesharetet (servant, keli kodesh, minister), waiting on them.

32. When erev came, with the setting of the shemesh, they brought to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach all the cholim and all those possessed by shedim.

33. And the whole shtetl gathered together at the delet.

34. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach administered refu'ah to many cholim suffering from various machalot, and he cast out many shedim. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not permit the shedim to give utterance, for the shedim knew the raz of his identity, that he was the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH MAKES HIS FIRST ITINERARY THROUGH THE GALIL (MT 4:23-25; MK 1:35-39; LK 4:42-44)

35. And very early, while it was still dark, having got up, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went out and away to a desolate place, and was davening shacharis there.

36. And Shimon and those with him searched for Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

37. And they found him and they say to him, "Everyone is seeking you" [Shir HaShirim 1:4; Chaggai 2:7].

38. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "Let us go elsewhere into the neighboring shtetlach, so that also there I may preach. For it was for this [purpose] I came. [Yeshayah 61:1]

39. And he came preaching in their shuls (synagogues) and casting out shedim in [the] whole [region of] the Galil.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S REFU'AH OF THE ISH METZORAH (MT 8:2-4; MK 1:40-45; LK 5:12-16)

40. And an ish metzorah (leper) comes to him begging him and kneeling down and saying, "If you are willing, you are able to make me tahor (clean)."

41. And being filled with rachmei Shomayim [and] stretching out his hand, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach touched [the man] and says to him, "I am willing. Be made tahor (cleansed)."

42. And ofen ort (immediately) the ish metzorah (leper) went away from him and he was made tahor.

43. And having sternly warned him, ofen ort (immediately) Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sent him away.

44. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, "See [that] you say nothing to anyone, but rather go show yourself to the kohen and offer [the korban] for the tohorah of you which Moshe (Rabbeinu) gave mitzva, for an edut (testimony) to them."[Vayikra 13:49, 14:1-32]

45. But the one having gone out began to preach many things and to spread the dvar, so that no longer was Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach able to openly enter into [the] shtetl, but he was outside in desolate places. And they were coming to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach from every direction.

## Mark 2

1. And having entered again into K'far-Nachum after [many] yamim, it was heard that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach is at home.

2. And many were gathered together so that there was no longer any room at the delet, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was speaking the dvar Hashem to them.

3. And they come carrying to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach a paralytic being carried along by arba'a anashim.

4. And not being able to bring [the paralytic] to him on account of the multitude, they removed the roof where Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was, and having made an opening, they lowered the mat upon which the paralytic was lying.

5. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having seen the emunah of them, says to the paralytic, "Beni, your averos are granted selicha."

6. And there were some of the Sofrim (Scribes) sitting there and thinking about these things in their levavot (hearts),

7. "Why is this one speaking thus?  He is guilty of Chillul Hashem gidduf.  Who is able to grant selicha to averos except Hashem?"  [Yeshayah 43:25]

8. And, ofen ort (immediately), having had da'as in his ruach that in this way they were thinking, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "Why are you considering such things in the your levavot?

9. Which is easier? To say to the paralytic, `Your averos are granted selicha', or to say, `Stand and pick up your mat and walk'?"

10. But in order that you may have da'as that the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14) has samchut (authority) on ha'aretz to grant that averos receive selicha," -- Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to the paralytic--

11. "To you I say, stand, pick up your mat, and go to your bais."

12. And the man arose, and, ofen ort (immediately), in front of everyone, taking the mat, he went outside.  So everyone was astonished and gave kavod to Hashem saying, "Never have we seen anthing like this."  THE KERI'AH (CALLING) OF MATTITYAHU THE MOCHES --THE SICHOS CHULIN SHEL TALMIDE CHACHAMIM (THE TABLE TALK OF THE WISE); CALLING CHOTE'IM TO TESHUVA (MT 9:9-13; MK 2:13-17; LK 5:27-31)

13. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went out again beside the lake; and all the multitude was coming to him, and he was teaching them Torah.

14. And as he was passing by, he saw Levi Ben Chalfai sitting in the tax office, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, "Follow me." And, rising up, Levi (Mattityahu) followed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

15. And it came to pass that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach reclined at tish in Levi's house, and many mochesim (tax collectors) and chote'im (sinners) were reclining at tish with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and with his talmidim.  For there were many, and they were following him.

16. And the Sofrim (scribes) of the Perushim, seeing that Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach eats with chote'im (sinners) and mochesim (tax collectors), were saying to his talmidim, "With mochesim (tax collectors) and chote'im (sinners) does he eat?"

17. And having heard this, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "It's not the strong ones that have need of a rofeh (physician) but rather the cholim.  I did not come to call [the] tzaddikim (righteous ones) but the chote'im (sinners) [to teshuva]. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH GIVES HIS TALMIDIM MASHALIM ABOUT TZOMOT (FASTS) (MT 9:14-17; MK 2:18-22; LK 5:33-39)

18. And the talmidim of Yochanan and the Perushim came with tzomot.  And they come and say to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Why [do] the talmidim of the Perushim and the talmidim of Yochanan come with tzomot, but your talmidim do not?"

19. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, said to them, "Surely the Bnei HaChuppah of the Chosson (Bridegroom) are not able to undergo tzomot as long as they have the Chossson with them, nu? As long as they have the Chosson with them, they are not able to undergo tzomot.

20. But yamim will come when the Chosson is taken away from them, and then they will undergo tzomot HaYom HaHu.

21. No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; otherwise, the patch will pull away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear results.

22. And no one puts yayin chadash (new wine) into old wineskins; otherwise, the yayin will burst the wineskins and the yayin is lost and so are the wineskins.  Instead, yayin chadash (new wine) [is put] into new wineskins. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND SHABBOS (MT 12:1-14; MK 2:23-3:6; LK 6:1-11)

23. And it came about [that] on Shabbos, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was passing through the grainfields, and his talmidim began to make [their] way picking the heads of grain. [Devarim 23:25]

24. And the Perushim said to him, "Look, why are they on Shabbatot engaging in what is not mutar (permissible) in the Torah?"

25. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "Have you never read in the Tanakh what Dovid HaMelech did when he was in need and he was hungry, he and the ones with him?

26. How he entered into the Beis Hashem during the yamim of Avyator the Kohen Gadol and the Lechem HaPanim he ate, which to be eaten it is not mutar (permissible) except by the Kohanim, and he gave [some] also to the ones with him." [Divrey Hayamim Alef 24:6, Shmuel Bais 8:17, Vayikra 24:5-9, Shmuel Alef 21:1-6]

27. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Shabbos was created for the sake of man and not man for the sake of Shabbos. [Shemot 23:12; Devarim 5:14]

28. Therefore, HaBen HaAdam [Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14] is Adon even of Shabbos."

## Mark 3

1. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach entered again into the shul. And there was there a man having a withered hand.

2. And they were watching Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach [to see] if on Shabbatot he will heal him, in order that they might accuse him.

3. And he says to the man, the one with the withered hand, "Stand up here in the center."

4. And he says to them, "Is it mutar (permissible) on Shabbatot to do tov or rah, to restore nefesh or to destroy [it]?" But they were silent.

5. And having looked [at] them with ka'as and having agmat nafesh at the stubborn hardness of their levavot, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to the man. "Stretch out your hand," And the man stretched it out, and his hand was restored.

6. And ofen ort (immediately) the Perushim went out and held consultation with the party of Herod against him as to how they might destroy him.

7. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach with his talmidim went away to the lake, and a great multitude from the Galil and also from Yehudah followed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

8. And from Yerushalayim and from Idumea and from the other side of the Yarden and from around Tzor-Tzidon area, a great multitude [followed], hearing everything that he was doing, and they came to Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach.

9. And he said to his talmidim that a sirah (boat) should stand ready for him, lest the multitude might crush him.

10. For he had brought refu'ah to many, with the result that as many as had afflictions pressed in on him in order to touch him.

11. And the ruchot hatemei'ot (unclean spirits), whenever they saw Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, were falling before him and were crying out, saying, "You are the Ben HaElohim!"

12. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sternly rebuked them, lest they should make him known.

13. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach goes up to the mountain and summons those whom he wanted, and they came to him.

14. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach appointed and gave s'michah to Shneym Asar, whom also he designated Shluchim, that they might be with him [have chavurah with him], and that he might send them out as his maggidim to preach,

15. and to have samchut to cast out shedim.

16. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach appointed the Shneym Asar: Shimon, to whom he gave the name "Kefa,"

17. and Ya'akov Ben-Zavdai and Yochanan, Ya'akov's brother. He gave to them the name "Bnei-Regesh," (Sons of Thunder).

18. And Andrew and Philippos and Bar-Talmai, and Mattityahu, and T'oma, and Ya'akov Ben-Chalfai, and Taddia, and Shimon the Zealot,

19. and Yehudah from K'riot, the one who betrayed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach. 



 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH ACCUSED OF CHILLUL HASHEM (MT.12:15-45; MK 3:19-30)

20. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach goes home; and again the multitude assembles, with the result that they were not able to have okhel.

21. And when his own mishpochah heard of this, they went out to constrain him.  For they were saying, "He is meshuga."

22. And the Sofrim (Scribes), the ones coming down from Yerushalayim, were saying, "He is possessed by Ba'al-zibbul and by the Sar HaShedim he casts out shedim."

23. But having called them, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was speaking to them in meshalim (parables), "How is it possible for Hasatan to cast out Hasatan?

24. And if a malchut is divided against itself, it is not possible for that malchut to stand.

25. And if a bais is divided against itself, it will not be possible for that bais to stand.

26. And if Hasatan has risen up against himself and is divided, it is not possible for him to stand, but his end has arrived.

27. But no one is able, having entered into the house of the strong man to plunder his possessions, unless first, he binds the strong man, and then he will plunder the house of the strong man. [Yeshayah 49:24,25]

28. Omein, I say to you that everything--the averos and the Chillul Hashem, whatever they may commit--of the bnei Adam will be granted selicha.

29. But whoever commits Chillul Hashem gidduf against the Ruach Hakodesh, can never have selicha, but is guilty of a chet Olam."

30. For they were saying, "He has a ruach temei'ah." WHO ARE THE TRUE ACHIM OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH? (MT 12:46-50; MK 3:31-35;  LK8:19-21)

31. And the Em (Mother) of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and his achim come and stand outside and they sent word to him.

32. And a multitude was sitting around him, and they are saying to him, "Hinei! Your Em (Mother)! And your achim! and your achayot are outside looking for you."

33. And in reply to them, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says, "Who is the Em (Mother) of me? And the achim of me?"

34. And having looked around at the ones sitting around him, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says, "Hinei! The Em (Mother) of me and the achim of me!

35. For whoever does the ratzon Hashem, this one is my brother and my sister and mother."

## Mark 4

1. And again Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach began to teach Torah beside the lake. And a huge multitude gathered together to him so that he got into a sirah (boat) on the lake and sat down.  The whole multitude was by the lake on the shore.

2. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was teaching them with many meshalim (parables) and in the shiurim he said, he was saying to them:

3. "Listen.  Hinei! The Sower went out to sow (seeds).

4. And it came about that when he went to sow, that some [seeds] fell beside the road. And the birds came and devoured it.

5. And other [seeds] fell upon the rocky places where it did not have much soil, and ofen ort (immediately) it sprang up because it did not have depth of soil.

6. And when the shemesh rose, it was scorched and, because it did not have a shoresh (root), it withered.

7. And other seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them, and it did not yield p'ri.

8. And other seed fell into the adamah tovah and it was giving p'ri, rising up and growing, thirty, sixty and one hundredfold."

9. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."

10. And when he was alone, the Shneym Asar were asking him for a hezber (explanation) of the meshalim.

11. And he was saying to them. "To you the raz (secret) of the Malchut Hashem has been given.  But to the outsiders, everything remains in meshalim,

12. in order that `YIRU they may see and not have da'as V'SHIM'U they may hear and not have binah, lest they should turn and they should receive refu'ah and selicha.'" (YESHAYAH 6:9-10, TARGUM HASHIVIM)

13. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "Do you not have da'as of the meaning of this mashal? Then how will you have binah of all the meshalim?

14. The one sowing sows the dvar Hashem.

15. And these are the ones beside the road where the dvar Hashem is sown.  And when they hear it, ofen ort (immediately) Hasatan comes and takes the dvar that has been sown in them.

16. And these are the ones sown upon the rocky places: when they hear the dvar, ofen ort (immediately) with simcha they receive it.

17. Yet they do not have a shoresh (root) in themselves but are transitory; then when ES TZARAH comes or persecution on account of the dvar, ofen ort (immediately) they fall away, they become shmad. [Yirmeyah 30:7; Mattityahu 24:21]

18. And others are the ones sown among thorns.  These are the ones having heard the dvar,

19. And the worries of the Olam Hazeh and the seduction of osher (wealth) and the desires for other things come in and choke the dvar Hashem and it does not bear p'ri.

20. And these are the ones sown upon adamah tovah: they hear the dvar Hashem and are mekabel dvar Hashem and bear p'ri, thirty, sixty and one hundredfold."

21. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying to them. "Surely a menorah is not brought out in order that it may be put under a measuring bucket or under the couch?  Rather, is it not brought out that it may be placed on the shulchan?

22. For there is not [anything] nistar (hidden, secret) except that it may be made hitgalut nor has it become nistar but that it may come into [the] open. [Yirmeyah 16:17]

23. If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."

24. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying to them, "Pay attention!  By what measure you measure it will be measured to you, and still more will be added to you.

25. For whoever has, it will be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him."

26. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying, "Thus is the Malchut Hashem: like a man who casts seed upon the soil,

27. and goes to sleep b'lailah and arises b'yom, and the seed sprouts up and grows in such a way that he does not have da'as of how it does so.

28. On its own, the soil bears p'ri: first the blade, then a head of grain, then full wheat in the head.

29. But when the crop is ripe, ofen ort (immediately) he puts forth the MAGGAL, KI VASHAL KATZIR ("sickle, for the harvest is ripe." [Yoel 3:13]

30. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying, "To what should we compare the Malchut Hashem or by what mashal may we present it?

31. The Malchut Hashem is like a mustard seed, which, when it is sown on the soil, is smaller [than] all the seeds on the earth.

32. And when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater [than] all the plants of the garden and puts forth large branches, so that the OF HASHOMAYIM can nest under its shade."

33. And with many such meshalim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshich was speaking to them the dvar Hashem as they were able to hear.

34. But apart from meshalim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was not speaking to them.  Only privately, in a yechidus, was Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach explaining everything to his own talmidim.        REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH THE BAAL MOFET (MIRACLE WORKER) (THE STILLING OF THE STORM: MT 8:23-34; MK 4:35-5:20; LK 8:22-39)

35. And on that day, when erev had come, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "Let us go over to the other side of the lake."

36. And leaving the multitude, they took Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, just as he was, in the sirah (boat), and other sirot (boats) were with him.

37. And there arose a fierce gale of wind and the waves were beating against the sirah (boat), so that it was already filling up.

38. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was in the stern on the cushion sleeping, and they woke him up, and they say to him, "Rebbe, does it not matter to you that we are perishing?"

39. And having been awakened, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach rebuked the wind, and he spoke to the lake, "Sha!  Be still!"  And there was a great calm.

40. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Why do you have   morech lev (cowardliness)? Do you still not have emunah?"

41. And they were afraid with a terrible pachad (fear), and they were saying to one another, "Who then is this that even the wind and the sea obey him?"

## Mark 5

1. And they came to the other side of the lake, to the country of the Gerasenes.

2. And as soon as Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach stepped out of the sirah (boat), ofen ort (immediately), a man with a ruach temei'ah from the kevarim (tombs) of the burial caves met him.

3. This man had (his) dwelling among the kevarim. And no one could keep him tied any longer, even with a kaval (chain/fetter);

4. because often he had been bound with shackles and a kaval and the shackles and the kaval had been torn apart by him, and no one had the ko'ach to subdue him.

5. And constantly, yomam valailah, among the kevarim and in the mountains, he was crying out and beating himself with stones.

6. And, having seen Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach from afar, he ran and fell down before him.

7. And having cried out with a kol gadol, he says, "Mah lanu valach, Yehoshua, Ben HaElohim HaElyon?  I implore you by Hashem, [do] not torment me."

8. For Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had been saying to him, "Come out of the man, ruach temei'ah!"

9.  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was questioning him, saying, "What is your name?" And he says to him, "`Legion' [is] my name, for we are many!"

10. And he begged Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach again and again not to exorcise him and banish him from that place.

11. Now there was a large herd of chazirim feeding nearby on the hillside.

12. And they (the ruchot hatemei'ot, the shedim) implored Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, "Send us into the chazirim, so that we may go into them."

13. And he permitted them.  And having come out, the ruchot hatemei'ot entered into the chazirim.  And the herd of chazirim rushed down the slope into the lake, and there were about two thousand of them, and they were drowned in the lake. [Michoh 7:19]

14. And the herdsmen feeding them fled and reported it in the village and in the sadot (fields), and the people came to see what had come to pass.

15. And they come to Yehoshua and they see the one that had been possessed by the shed sitting, clothed and in his right mind -- the very one having had the "Legion!"  And they were afraid.

16. And the edat re'iyah (eyewitnesses) of what had happened to the man possessed by shedim and of what had happened to the chazirim reported it.

17. Then they began to implore Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to depart from their region.

18. And as Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was stepping into the sirah (boat), the one who had been possessed by shedim was imploring him that he might accompany him.

19. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not permit him, but says to him, "Go home to your people and report to them everything that Hashem has done for you and [that] he had rachmanim (mercy) upon you."

20. And the man left and began to preach in the Decapolis everything that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had done for him, and everyone was amazed.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S TZITZIT AND TAHARAT HAMISHPOCHAH: EMUNAH AS THE MEANS OF BRINGING WOMEN BACK FROM THE STATE OF ESCHATOLOGICAL NIDDAH (SEPARATION) (MT9:18-26; MK 5:21-43; LK 8:40-56)

21. And when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had crossed over again in the sirah (boat) to the other side, a large multitude gathered together to him, and he was beside the lake.

22. And one of the Roshei Beit HaKnesset comes -- Ya'ir was his name -- and, having seen Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, he falls down at his feet,

23. and he begs him earnestly saying, "Biti (my daughter) is at the point of mavet.  Come and put your hand on her that she may receive refu'ah and may live."

24.  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went with Ya'ir. And a large multitude were following him and they were pressing against Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

25. And [there was] an isha having a flow of dahm shteym esreh shanah. [Vayikra 15:25-30]

26. And having suffered much by many rofim (physicians) and having spent everything she had, instead of recovering, her condition deteriorated.

27. And having heard about Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, she came up  behind him in the multitude, and touched his garment.

28. For she was saying, "If I may touch even the garments of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, I will receive refu'ah."

29. And ofen ort (immediately), the flow of her dahm was dried up and she felt in (her) guf (body) that she has been given refu'ah from the shrekliche (terrible) affliction.

30. And ofen ort (immediately) Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having perceived  within himself that gevurah had gone forth from him, turned around in the crowd and said, "Who touched my garments?"

31. And the talmidim of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach were saying to him, "You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, `Who touched me?'"

32. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was looking around to see the one having done this.

33. Now the isha, B'YIR'AH (with fear) and BIRA'DAH (trembling), aware of what had happened to her, came and fell down before Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and told him the Emes.

34. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to her, "Bat, your emunah has brought you refu'ah.  Go in shalom and receive refu'ah from  your affliction."

35. While Rebbe Malech HaMoshiach was still speaking, some came from the Rosh Beit HaKnesset, saying, "Your yaldah is niftar, are you still causing a shter (bother) for the rabbi?"

36. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having overheard what was being spoken, says to the Rosh Beit HaKnesset, "Do not be afraid, only have emunah."

37. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach did not permit anyone to follow after him, except Kefa and Ya'akov and Yochanan, the brother of Ya'akov.

38. And they come into the bais of the Rosh Beit HaKnesset, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach beheld much commotion and weeping and loud wailing.

39. And having entered, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "Why are you distressed and weeping?  The yaldah is not niftar but is only sleeping."

40. And they began making leitzonus of him.  But having put everyone out, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach takes the abba of the na'arah and the immah and the ones with him, and goes into where the na'arah was.

41. And having grasped the hand of the na'arah, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to her, "Talitha Koum," which, being translated, means "Little girl, to you I say, arise!"

42. And ofen ort (immediately) the na'arah arose and she was walking around. For she was twelve years old. And ofen ort (immediately) they were amazed with great wonder.

43. And he gave orders to them earnestly that no one should have da'as of this.  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to give her some okhel.

## Mark 6

1. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came out from there and comes into his shtetl and his talmidim follow him.

2. And Shabbos having come, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began to say shiurim in the shul, and many, listening, were amazed, saying, "From where [did] this one get lernen, and what [is] the chochmah that has been given to this one?  And what gevurot are being done by his hands?

3. Is not this one the Naggar (Carpenter), Ben-Miryam? The brother of Ya'akov, Yosef, Yehuda and Shimon?  And, are not  his achayot here with us?"  And they were taking offense at Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

4. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying to them, "A navi is not without his kavod, except in his own shtetl and among his own mishpochah and in his own bais."

5. And he was not able there to do many nissim, except on a few cholim he laid (his) hands and administered refu'ah to them.
 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S TALMIDIM ARE EMPOWERED FOR ADMINISTERING REFU'AH   (MT 10:1-42; MK 6:6-13; LK 9:1-6)

6. And he wondered on account of their lack of emunah. And he was going around the shtetlach in a circuit, saying shiurim.

7. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach summons the Shneym Asar, and he began to send them out two by two, and he was giving to them samchut [over] the ruchot hatume'ot (unclean spirits). [Devarim 17:6]

8. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gave mitzot to them that they should take nothing on [the] derech except a mere walking stick -- not lechem, not a beggar's sack, nor a money belt;

9. but instead, to wear sandals, and not to take an extra kaftan.

10. And he was saying to them, "Wherever you enter into a bais, stay there until you leave that area.

11. And whatever place does not give you the kabbalat panim, and does not listen to you, then, as you are leaving there, let it be NI'ER CHATZNO, shake off the dust of your feet, for an edut to them.

12. And having gone out, they preached that bnei Adam should teshuva.

13. And many shedim they were casting out, and they were anointing with shemen (oil) many cholim, and they were administering refu'ah to them.  HEROD'S PECHADIM (TERRORS) (MT 14:1-12; MK 6:14-29; LK 9:7-9)

14. And Herod the king heard of it, for the name of Yehoshua had become famous, and some were saying, "Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva has been made to stand up alive from [the] mesim, and for this reason the nissim (miracles) are at work in him."

15. But others were saying, "It is Eliyahu."  And still others were saying, "He is a navi, like one of the nevi'im of old." [Malachi 4:5]

16. But when Herod heard of it, he kept saying, "Yochanan whom I beheaded has stood up alive from the mesim!"

17. For Herod himself had sent and had Yochanan arrested and bound in the beis hasohar, on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother, Philippos, for he had married her.

18. But Yochanan was saying to Herod, "It is not mutar (permissible) according to the Torah for you to have your brother's wife." [Vayikra 18:16, 20:21]

19. And Herodias bore a grudge against Yochanan and desired to kill him. But she could not.

20. For Herod feared Yochanan, knowing him [to be] a tzaddik and kadosh, and Herod was protecting Yochanan. And when Herod heard    Yochanan, he was greatly disturbed, and [yet] gladly Herod was listening to Yochanan.

21. And, an opportune day having come, when Herod, on his birthday, gave a seudah for the court of his nobles, and the military commanders, and those of chashivut (prominence) of the Galil, [Esther 1:3, 2:18]

22. And when his daughter entered and danced, she pleased Herod and the ones reclining at the seudah with him.  And the king said to the the girl, "Ask me whatever you wish and I will give [it] to you."

23. And he made an shevu'ah (oath) to her solemnly, "Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my Malchut. [Esther 5:3,6; 7:2]

24. And having gone out, she said to her mother, "What should I ask [for]?"  And her mother said, "The rosh Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva."

25. And having entered, ofen ort (immediately), with haste before the king, she made a request, saying, "You may give to me upon a platter the rosh Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva."

26. And having become very sad, the king, on account of his shevu'ah and on account of the ones reclining at the seudah [with him], was unwilling to refuse her.

27. And, ofen ort (immediately), the king sent an executioner and commanded him to bring the rosh Yochanan.  And having left, the executioner beheaded Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva in the beit hasohar.

28. And he brought the rosh Yochanan upon a platter and gave it to the young girl, and the young girl gave it to her mother.

29. And, having heard this, Yochanan's talmidim came and carried away his geviyah and placed it in a kever.    
 REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S TISH IN THE MIDBAR AND THE "MANNA" FROM SHOMAYIM SERVED AT HIS FARBRENGEN (INSPIRATIONAL GATHERING)    (MT 14:13-21; MK 6:30-44; LK9:10-17; JO 6:1-13)

30. And the Shluchim gathered together with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and reported to him everything which they did and which they had taught.

31. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "Come away a while, you yourselves, for a yechidus in a quiet place for a Shabbaton."  For there were many coming and going, and they did not even have time for okhel.

32. And they departed in the sirah (boat) to a secluded place for a yechidus.

33. And the people, recognizing them, saw them departing, and from all the shtetlach they ran there and arrived ahead of them.

34. And having gotten out of the sirah (boat), Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach  saw a large multitude and he had rachamanut on them, for they were KATSON ASHER AIN LAHEM RO'EH ("like sheep without a shepherd"), and Rebbe Malech HaMoshiach began to teach them many things. (Bamidbar 27:17; Melachim Alef 22:17; Divrey Hayamim Bais 18:16; Yechezkel 34:8)

35. And when it was already a late hour, his talmidim came up to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and were saying, "This place is desolate and already [it is] late.

36. Send them away, in order that, having departed to the surrounding farms and shtetlach, they may buy for themselves what okhel they may eat."

37. But in reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "You yourselves give them [something] to eat."  And they say to him, "Shall we go and spend two hundred denarii for lechem and give to them to eat?" [Melachim Bais 4:42-44]

38. And Rebbe, Melech Hamoshiach says to them, "How much lechem do you have?  Go [and] see." And knowing, the talmidim of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach say, "Chamesh, and dagim, shenayim."

39. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach commanded them to recline at tish, as it were, everyone group by group, on the green grass.

40. And they reclined, group by group, in hundreds and in fifties.

41. And, having taken the chamesh loaves and the shnei hadagim and looking up to Shomayim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said a berakhah, and having offered the betzi'at halechem, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was giving to his talmidim in order that they might set them before the people.  And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach divided the shnei hadagim among them all.

42. And everyone ate, and they were satisfied,

43. And they picked up shirayim, shneym asar baskets full, and from the dagim.

44. And those who had eaten the loaves numbered chamesh elafim.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH THE BAAL MOFET (MIRACLE WORKER), WALKING AL PNEI HAMAYIM (MT 14:22-36; MK 6:45-56; JO 6:14-21)

45. And ofen ort (immediately) Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach compelled his talmidim to embark into the sirah (boat) and to go before [him] to the other side to Beit-Tzaidah, while he dismisses the multitude.

46. And having said a "Shalom" farewell to them, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach departed to the mountain to daven.

47. And erev having come, the sirah (boat) was in [the] middle of the lake, and Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was alone on shore.

48. And having seen them laboring at the oars, for the wind was against them, about the fourth watch of halailah, Moshiach comes to them, walking on the lake. And he wanted to go by them.

49. But having seen him on the lake, they thought that it is a ruach refa'im.  And they cried out;

50. for everyone saw him.  And ofen ort (immediately) Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach spoke with them, and they were filled with pachad (terror). Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "Chazak! Ani hu.  Do not be afraid."

51. And he got into the sirah (boat) with them.  And the wind died down. And in themselves they were exceedingly amazed.

52. For they did not understand concerning the loaves [6:43], but their levavot had been hardened.

53. And having crossed over onto the land, they came to Gennesaret and anchored [there].

54. And when they disembark from the sirah (boat), the people ofen ort (immediately) recognized Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

55. And the people rushed everywhere in that whole region, and they began to carry about on their mats the cholim to where they heard he was.

56. And wherever Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was entering into the shtetlach or into towns or into the countryside, thy laid the cholim in the marketplaces, entreating him that they might just touch the tzitzit of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.  And as many as touched it were receiving refu'ah. [Bamidbar 15:38-41; Devarim 22:12]

## Mark 7

1. And, when they had come down from Yerushalayim, the Perushim and some of the Sofrim come together around Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach,

2. and they had observed that some of his talmidim were eating their lechem with yadayim temei'ot, that is, unwashed hands.

3. [For the Perushim, and indeed this was the Jewish minhag, do not eat without doing n'tilat yadayim and also observing the Masoret HaZekenim [the Torah Sheb'al peh].

4. And when they come from [the] marketplace, unless they do so, they do not eat.  And there are many other things which they have received in order to observe, such as the tevilah of cups and pitchers and copperpots.]

5. And the Perushim and the Sofrim question Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Why do your talmidim not follow the halakhah according to the Masoret HaZekenim, but eat their lechem with yadaym temei'ot?"

6. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Yeshayah rightly gave nevu'ah of you tzevu'im, as it has been written, HAAM HAZEH BISFATAV KIBDUNI V'LIBO RIKHAK MIMENI VATEHI YIRATAM OTI MITZVAT ANASHIM MELUMMADAH ("This people with [their] lips honor me, but their heart is removed far away from me.

7. And in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the mitzvot of men.") [Yeshayah 29:13]

8. Abandoning the mitzvat Hashem, you are holding to the Masoret HaBnei Adam."

9. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was saying to them, "You have a fine knack for setting aside the mitzvat Hashem in order that your own masorah might stand undisturbed.

10. For Moshe [Rabbeinu] said, `KABED ES AVICHA V'ES IMMECHA' ("Honor your father and your mother"), and, `The one reviling AVIV V'IMMO MOT YUMAT ("father or mother -- let him be put to death.' [Shemot 20:12, Devarim 5:16, Shemot 21:17, Vayikra 20:9]

11. But you say, `If a man says to his Av or to his Em, whatever by me you might have benefited is Korban' [that is, the taitsh (translation) is an offering to Hashem],

12. then no longer do you permit him to do anything for his Av  or his Em.

13. You nullify and make void the dvar Hashem by means of your masorah you received. And you do many similar things."

14. And having summoned again the multitude, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was saying to them, "Give ear to me and have binah.

15. "There is nothing outside of a ben Adam (human being) entering into him which is able to make him tameh, but it is the things coming out from the ben Adam that make him tameh."

16.  

17. And when he left the multitude and entered a bais, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach's talmidim were asking him [about] the mashal.

18. And he says to them, "Are you so lacking in binah also? Do you not have binah that it is not what is outside and entering into the ben Adam that is able to make him tameh?

19. "Because it does not enter into his lev, but into his stomach and goes out into the latrine," making all the okhel tohar.

20. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying, "It is the thing proceeding out of the ben Adam that makes him tameh.

21. "For from within the lev of the ben Adam comes evil cravings and makhshavot: then zenunim (fornications), thefts (gneyvot), murders (retzichot),

22. ni'ufim (adulteries), chamdanut (greediness), rishah (wickedness), nechalim (scheming deceitfulness), zimmah (lewdness, sensuality), an 'ayin horo or ro'ah 'ayin (an envious evil eye), lashon hora, ga'avah (pride), and ivvelet (foolishness).

23. All these evil things proceed from within and make the ben Adam tameh. 

  THE EMUNAH OF THE GOYIM IN SPITE OF THE MECHITZAH OF GENDER AND NATIONALITY SEPARATING THEM FROM REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH (MT 15:21-28; MK7:24-30)

24. And from there Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach arose and departed to the district of Tzor and Tzidon. And having entered into a bais he wanted no one to have da'as, [yet] he was not able to escape notice.

25. But, after hearing about Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, ofen ort (immediately), an isha, whose yaldah was having a ruach temei'ah, came and fell down at his feet.

26. Now the woman was a Yevanit (Greek), by birth a Syrophoenician, and she was asking Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to cast the shed out of her bat (daughter).

27. And he was saying to her, "Rishonah allow the banim to be satisfied, for it is not tov to take the lechem of the yeladim and throw it to kelevim."

28. But she replied, saying, "Ken, Adoni, but even the kelevim under the shulchan eat from the crumbs of the yeladim."

29. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to her, "Because of this teshuva (answer), go your way, the shed has gone out from the bat of you."

30. And having departed to her bais, she found the yaldah lying on the bed, the shed having gone out.
 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH DEPARTS TO LAKE KINNERET  (MT 15:29-38; MK 7:31-8:9)

31. When he returned from the region of Tzor, and then went through Tzidon to Lake Kinneret within the region of the Decapolis,

32. they bring to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach [a man who was] cheresh-illem (deaf and mute) and they entreated him to lay hands on him.

33. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach took him aside from the multitude by himself and put his fingers into his ears, and spat, and with that touched the tongue of the mute man;

34. and, looking up to Shomayim with a deep sigh, he says to him, "Ephphatha," (which means, "Be opened!").

35. Ofen ort (immediately) his ears were opened, and the impediment of his lashon was loosed and he was speaking properly.

36. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was directing them not to tell anyone. But the more he ordered them, they were proclaiming [it] all the more.

37. And they were all astonished beyond all measure, saying, "He has done all things tov me'od, and he makes even the chereshim (deaf people) to hear and the illemim to speak. [Yeshayah 35:5,6]

## Mark 8

1. In yamim hahem (those days), again, when there was a great multitude and they had no okhel, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach called his talmidim, and says to them,

2. "I have rachamanut (compassion) on the multitude, because they already sheloshah yamim have remained with me and they do not have anything they may eat;

3. and if I send them away hungry to their batim, they will give out on the way; and some of them have come from faraway."

4. And his talmidim answered him, "From where will anyone be able to find enough lechem to feed these ones here in the midbar?" [Bamidbar 11:21]

5. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was asking them, "How many loaves do you have?" And they said, "Shevah."

6. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach directed the multitude to recline at tish, as it were, on the ground. And having taken the sheva kikrot (loaves), he made a berakhah and offered the betzi'at halechem (the breaking of the bread) and was giving [them] to his talmidim to serve to them, and they served the multitude.

7. And they also had a few small dagim.  And after he had made the berakhah over them, he directed these to be served as well.

8. And they ate and were satisfied. And there was an abundance of shirayim (leftovers), sheva baskets [full].

9. And there were approximately arba'at elafim (four thousand [people]). And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sent them away. JEWISH MANHIGIM (LEADERS) TEST REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH  (MT 15:39-16:4; LK 8:10-12)

10. And ofen ort (immediately), having embarked onto the sirah (boat) with his talmidim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came into the region of Dalmanutha.

11. And the Perushim came out and began to argue with him, seeking from him an ot min HaShomayim (a sign from heaven), testing him.

12. And sighing deeply in his ruach, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Why does hador hazeh (this generation) seek for an ot? Omein, I say to you, no ot shall be given to hador hazeh." REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH SHMOOZES OUT A SCOLDING AND CHIDES HIS TALMIDIM, WARNING THEM ABOUT TEACHING THAT PUFFS UP WITH BLINDING GA'AVAH (PRIDE) (MT 16:5-12; MK 8:13-26)

13. And having left them, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach again embarked and departed to the other side.

14. And his talmidim had forgotten to take lechem and did not have anything except one kikar (loaf) in the sirah (boat) with them.

15. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was giving orders to them, saying, "Take care!  Beware of the se'or (leaven) of the Perushim and the se'or of Herod."

16. And the talmidim were beginning to discuss among themselves that they do not have [any] kikrot (loaves).

17. And aware of this, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "Why are you discussing that you do not have kikrot? Do you not yet have binah? nor comprehend?  Have your levavot fallen into timtum halev (hardening of the heart), KESHI (stubbornness, hardness DEVARIM 9:27)? [Yeshayah 6:9,10]

18. EINAYIM LAKHEM V'LO TIRU V'OZNAYIM LAKHEM V'LO TISHMA'U ("Having eyes, do you not see?  And having ears, do you not hear?"--Yirmeyah 5:21; Yechezkel 12:2) And do you not remember,

19. when I offered the bezi'at halechem with the chamesh kikrot for the chameshet ha'alafim, how many baskets of shirayim you picked up?"  And they say to him, "Shneym Asar."

20. And when I offered the bezi'at halechem over the shevah for the arba'at haalafim, how many baskets full of shirayim did you pick up?" And they say to him, "Shiva."

21. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying to them, "Do you not yet have binah?"

22. And they come to Beit-Tzaidah. And they bring to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach an ivver (blind man), and entreated him to touch him.

23. And having grasped the hand of the ivver, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach took him outside the shtetl; and, having put spittle on his eyes, [and] having laid hands upon him, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was questioning him, "Do you see anything?"

24. And after looking up, the ivver was was saying, "I see bnei Adam--they look like trees walking!"

25. Then again Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach placed his hands upon his eyes; and the man looked intently and was restored, and  was seeing everything clearly.

26. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sent the man to his bais, saying, "Do not even enter the shtetl."    THE ANI MA'AMIN OF THE CORRECT (ORTHODOX JEWISH) EMUNAH (FAITH), THE EMUNAH OF THE TRUE DAT HAYEHUDIT (MT 16:13-20; MK 8:27-30; LK 9:18-21)

27. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went out along with his talmidim, to the shtetlach of Caesarea Philippi;  and on the way he was questioning his talmidim, saying to them, "Who do bnei Adam say that I am?"

28. And the talmidim spoke to him, saying, "`Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva;' and others say, `Eliyahu;' but others, `One  of the nevi'im.'" [Malachi 4:5]

29. And he continued questioning them, "But who do you say that I am?"  In reply, Kefa says to him, "You are the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."

30. And he warned them to tell no one about him. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH BEGINS TO GIVE THE NEVU'AH (PROPHECY) OF HIS COMING MAVET AND TECHIYAS HAMESIM (MT 16:21-28; MK 8:31-38; LK 9:22-27)

31. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began to teach them that it is necessary [for] the Ben HaAdam [Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14] to suffer many things and to be rejected by the Zekenim and the Rashei Hakohanim (the Chief Priests) and the Sofrim (Scribes), and to be killed and after Shalosha Yamim to undergo the Techiyas HaMesim."

32. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was speaking about the matter plainly. And Shimon Kefa took him aside and began to rebuke him.

33. But having turned around and having looked at his talmidim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach rebuked Kefa, and says, "Get behind me, Hasatan; for you are not putting your machshavot (thoughts) on the interests of Hashem but on that of bnei Adam."

34. And having summoned the multitude along with his talmidim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "If anyone wishes to follow after me, let him make hakhchashah (denial) of himself, and take up his aitz of mesiras nefesh (self-sacrifice), and follow me.

35. "For whoever wishes to save his nefesh will lose it; but whoever loses his nefesh for my sake and for the sake of the Besuras HaGeulah will save it.

36. "For how is the ben Adam nehneh (benefited) if he gain the kol haOlam, and forfeit his neshamah?

37. "For what shall a ben Adam give in exchange [for] his neshamah?

38. "For whoever feels bushah (shame) regarding me and my dvarim in this dor hano'ef v'hachoteh (adulterous and sinful generation), the Ben HaAdam will also have bushah regarding him, when Moshiach comes in the kavod of his Av with the malakhim hakedoshim."

## Mark 9

1. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying to them, "Omein, I say to you, there are some of those standing here who shall not taste mavet until they see that the Malchut Hashem has come in gevurah." A PREVIEW OF THE BIAS HAMOSHIACH  (MT 17:1-13; MK 9:2-13; LK 9:28-36)

2. And after shishah yamim Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach takes Kefa and Ya'akov and Yochanan, and brought them up a high mountain  by themselves. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was transfigured before them;

3. and his garments became like a dazzlingly brilliant kittel, gantz (exceedingly) white, more white than anyone on earth could bleach them.

4. And Eliyahu Hanavi appeared to them along with Moshe (Rabbeinu), and they were talking with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

5. And in reply, Kefa says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Rebbe, it is tov [for] us to be here, and let us make shalosh sukkot, one for you and one for Moshe (Rabbeinu) and one for Eliyahu Hanavi.

6. Kefa did not know what he was answering, for they were tzufloigen (dazed) with pachad (terror).

7. And there came an anan (cloud) that was overshadowing them, and there came a bat kol out of the anan, "ZEH BENI AHUVI, ELAV TISHMA'UN (Listen to him!)" (Tehillim 2:7) [Shemot 24:16]

8. And suddenly, when they looked around, they saw no one in their company any more, except only Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

9. And [as] they were coming down from the mountain, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gave instructions to them that they should tell no one what they saw, except when the Ben HaAdam [Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14] should arise in his Techiyas HaMesim.

10. And they retained Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's dvar, discussing among themselves what he might mean by "his Techiyas HaMesim."

11. And they were questioning Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, "Why is it that the Sofrim (Scribes) say it is necessary for Eliyahu Hanavi to come rishonah?"

12. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Eliyahu Hanavi  indeed does come rishonah and brings tikkun to all things.  And yet how is it written of the Ben HaAdam that he must suffer many things and be NIVZEH VACHADAL ("despised and rejected"--Yeshayah 53:3)?

13. "But I say to you, that Eliyahu Hanavi has indeed come, and they did to him whatever they pleased, just as it has been written concerning him." [Melachim Alef 19:2, 10; Malachi 3:23f (4:5f)] REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH HEALS THE BOCHUR POSSESSED BY SHEDIM     MT 17:14-21; MK 9:14-29; LK 9:37-42)

14. And when they returned to the talmidim, they saw a great multitude around them and [the] Sofrim (Scribes) arguing with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's talmidim.

15. And ofen ort (immediately), as soon as the multitude saw Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, they were surprised and began running up to [him] with "Shalom" greetings.

16. And he questioned them, "About what are you arguing with them?"

17. And one of the multitude answered Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Rabbi, I brought beni (my son) to you, because he has a shed that makes him illem (mute).

18. "And whenever it seizes him, it throws into convulsions and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. And I told your talmidim in order that they might cast it out, and they did not have the ko'ach."

19. In reply to them, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says, "O dor with emunah, how long will I be with you? How long will I put up with you? Bring the bochur to me!"

20. They brought the bochur to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.  And when the shed saw Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, it threw the bochur into convulsions, and, falling to the ground, the bochur began rolling around foaming at the mouth.

21. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach questioned the bochur's abba, "How long has this been happening to him?"  And he said, "From kinder-yoren.

22. And also it has often thrown him into the aish and into the mayim that it might destroy him. But if you can do anything, grant rachamim upon us and help us!"

23. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "`If you can?`!! All things are possible to him who has emunah!"

24. Ofen ort (immediately) the abba of the bochur cried out and began saying, "Ani Ma'amin! Help my lack of emunah!"

25. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having seen that a multitude was gathering, rebuked the ruach hatemei'ah, saying to it, "You cheresh-illem (deaf and mute) ruach hatemei'ah, I command you, come out from him and do not ever enter into him again!"

26. And after shrieking out a shrai (scream) and throwing the bochur into violent seizures, the ruach hatemei'ah came it.  And the bochur was so like a geviyah (corpse) that many exclaimed he was niftar.

27. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having grasped the hand of the bochur, lifted him up; and the bochur stood up.

28. And, having entered into a bais, his talmidim began questioning Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach privately, "Why were we not able to perform the gerush shedim (exorcism)?"

29. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "This kind of gerush shedim is accomplished only by davening tefillos."  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S SECOND NEVU'AH OF HIS SUFFERING AND THE KAVOD TO FOLLOW  (MT 17:22-23; MK 9:30-32; LK 9:43-45)

30. And from there they went forth and were passing through the Galil, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not want anyone to have da'as.

31. For Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was teaching his talmidim and was saying to them, "The Ben HaAdam [Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14] is to be betrayed into the hands of bnei Adam, and MOSHIACH YIKARET ("Moshiach will be violently killed," Daniel 9:26), and when he has been killed, he will rise in his Techiyas HaMesim on Yom HaShelishi."

32. But they were did binah concerning this dvar, and they were afraid to inquire further.

 A QUESTION FOR REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH: WHO ARE THE GEDOLIM? (MT 18:1-5; MK 9:33-37; LK 9:46-48)

33. And they came to K'far-Nachum; And when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was in the bais, he began questioning them, "What were you arguing about baderech?"

34. But they were keeping silent, for baderech they were discussing with one another which of the talmidim was hagadol.

35. And sitting down, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach called the having sat down he called the Shneym Asar and says to them, "If anyone wishes to be Rishon, he shall be Acharon, and mesharet of all."

36. And having taken a yeled, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach set him in [the] center of them, and, having taken the yeled into his arms, he said to them,

37. "Whoever receives one yeled such as this bishmi (in my name) receives me, and whoever receives me, receives not only me but the One who sent me."  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH SPEAKS OF THE MICHSHOLIM OF THE OLAM HAZEH  (MT 18:6-14; MK 9:38-50; LK 9:49-50)

38. Yochanan said to him, "Rebbe, we saw someone performing a gerush shedim in your name, and we were trying to stop him, because he was not one of your chasidim." [Bamidbar 11:27-29]

39. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Do not stop him, for no one who will accomplish nifla'ot bishmi (in my name) will be able soon afterward to speak lashon hora about me.

40. "For the one who is not our mitnagged (opponent) is for us.

41. "For whoever gives you to drink a kos of mayim bishmi (in my name) because you are talmidim of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, omein  I say to you, he shall not lose his sachar.

42. "And whoever causes a michshol (stumbling block) for one of these little ones, the ma'aminim b'Moshiach who have emunah in me, it would be better for him if a heavy millstone, one turned by a donkey, were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea.

43. "And if your yad (hand) causes you a michshol, cut off your yad; for it is better for you if you enter Chayyei Olam as an amputee, than, having both yadayim, you go away into Gehinnom, into the AISH LO TIKHBEH ("fire not [ever] extinguished" Yeshayah 66:24).

44.  

45. "And if your regel (foot) causes you a michshol, cut off you regel; it is better for you to enter Chayyei Olam lame, than, having both raglayim, to be cast into Gehinnom.

46.  

47. "And if your ayin (eye) causes you a michshol, take it out; for it is better for you to enter the Malchut Hashem one-eyed, than, having both eynayim, to be cast into Gehinnom,

48. "where their TOLA'AT LO TAMUT ("worm does not die"--Yeshayah 66:24) and AISH LO TIKHBEH ("the fire not [ever] extinguished"-- Yeshayah 66:24).

49. "For everyone with have aish as his melach (salt). [Vayikra 2:13]

50. "Melach is tov, but if the melach becomes unsalty, by what [means] will you make it salty again?  Have melach in yourselves. And among yourselves let there be shalom."

## Mark 10

1. And from there, having got up, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach comes  into the region of Yehudah and on the other side of the Yarden, and again multitudes gather to him, and as was his minhag (custom), once more he was teaching them Torah. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S TORAH ON THE GET (MT 19:3-12; MK 10:2-12)

2. And, having approached, the Perushim, testing him, were asking him, "Is it mutar (permissible) for a man to give a get to his wife?"

3. But in reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "What mitzva did Moshe [Rabbeinu] give you?"

4. And they said, "Moshe Rabbeinu made it mutar (permissible) for a man to write SEFER KERITUT (a get, a sefer keritut, bill of divorcement) and to send her away (dismiss her, divorce her)." [Devarim 24:1-4]

5. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Because of the hardness of your levavot, he wrote you this mitzva. [Tehillim 95:8]

6. "But from the Reshit of the Beri'ah (beginning of the creation) ZACHAR UNEKEVAH BARA OTAM (Hashem "made them male and female"). [Bereshis 1:27,5:2]

7. "AL KEN YA'AZAV ISH ES AVIV V'ES IMMO V'DAVAK B'ISHTO

8. VHAYU L'VASAR ECHAD" (" A man will leave his father and his mother and he will be joined to his isha (wife), and the two will be one flesh;") [Bereshis 2:24] For this reason, they are no longer Shenayim but Basar Echad.

9. "Therefore, what Hashem has joined together, let no ben Adam separate."

10. And in the bais, the talmidim began to question Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach about this again.

11. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "Whoever gives a get to his isha and marries another, commits ni'uf (adultery) against his isha.

12. And if she gets a gerushim (divorcement) from her ba'al and marries another, she commits ni'uf (adultery). [Mattityahu 19:9]
 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH ON THE SUBJECT OF CHINUCH HABANOS (MT 19:13-15; MK 10:13-16; LK 18:15-17)

13. And they brought to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach yeladim that he might lay his hands on them.  But the talmidim rebuked them.

14. And having seen this, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach became displeased and indignant, and said to his talmidim, "Permit the yeladim to come to me, and do not hinder them, for of such as these is the Malchut Hashem.

15. "Omein, I say to you, whoever is not mekabel Malchut Hashem as a yeled would be mekabel Malchut Hashem, will by no means enter it."

16. And having taken the yeladim into his arms, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach laid his hands on them and made a berakhah over them.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND ONE OF THE BAALE-BATTIM OF YISROEL, WHO BECAUSE OF HIS LACK OF PERCEPTION OF TRUE RICHES, PASSES BY THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME MEKABEL MOSHIACH AND RECEIVE S'MICHAH AND THE AVODAS KODESH MINISTRY OF ONE OF MOSHIACH'S TALMIDIM. (MT 19:13-15; MK10:13-16; LK 18:15-17)

17. And as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was setting out to travel, one running and falling down before him, was asking him, "Rabbi haTov, what mitzva may I do that I might inherit Chayyei Olam?"

18. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Why do you call me `tov'? No one [is] tov except echad, Elohim."

19. "You have da'as of the mitzvot, the Aseres Ha-Dibros (The Decalogue), LO TIRTZACH, LO TINAF, LO TIGNOV, LO TA'ANEH V'REI'AC ED SHAKER, KABEID ES A'VICHA V'ES IMMECHAH ("Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness (do not defraud), honor your father and mother.")" [Shemot 20:12-16; Devarim 5:16-20]

20. And the man was saying to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Rabbi, from kinder-yoren I have been shomer mitzvot, keeping all these things."

21. And looking at him and having ahavah for his neshamah, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "One thing you lack: go and sell all your possessions and give to the aniyim (poor), and you will have otzar (treasure) in Shomayim; and come, follow me [as my talmid].

22. But at the dvar haMoshiach, his face turned gloomy and he departed with agmat nefesh, for he had many possessions.

23. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, looking around, says to his talmidim, "How difficult it will be for the ashirim to enter the Malchut Hashem!" [Tehillim 52:7, 62:10]

24. And the talmidim were amazed at his dvarim. But again Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, in reply, says to them, "Yeladim, how difficult it is to enter into the Malchut Hashem.

25. "It is easier [for] a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for an ashir (rich person) to enter the Malchut Hashem."

26. And they were even more amazed, saying to one another, "Then who with the Yeshu'at Eloheinu is able to be saved?"

27. Having looked at them, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says, "With bnei Adam [this is] impossible, but not with Hashem. For all things are possible with Hashem."

28. Shimon Kefa began to say to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Hinei! We left everything and have followed you!"

29. Yehoshua said, "Omein, I say to you, there is no one who left bais or achim or achayot or imma or abba or banim or sadot for the sake of me and for the sake of the Besuras HaGeulah,

30. "but that he shall receive a hundredfold now in the Olam Hazeh, batim (houses) and achim and achayot and imahot and banim and sadot with redifot (persecutions); and in Olam Habah, Chayyei Olam."
 THE RISHONIM (FIRST) AND THE ACHARONIM (LAST)

31. "And many Rishonim will be Acharonim; and the Acharonim, will be Rishonim."
 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND HIS THIRD NEVU'AH CONCERNING HIS MAVET AND TECHIYAS HAMESIM (MT 20:17-19; MK 10:32-34; LK 18:31-34)

32. And they were on the derech making aliyah leregel to Yerushalayim, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was leading out, walking ahead of them, and they were astounded, and the ones following were afraid. And again Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach took the Shneym Asar aside for a yechidus and began to tell them what was to happen to him,

33. saying, "Hinei, we are making aliyah leregel to Yerushalayim, and the Ben Adam will be betrayed to the Rashei Hakohanim and the Sofrim (Scribes) and they will condemn him with onesh mavet and will hand him over to the Goyim,

34. "And they will mock him and spit on him and scourge him and will kill [him], and on the Yom HaShelishi he in his Techiyas HaMesim stand up alive again." YOCHANAN AND YA'AKOV: SELFISH AMBITION AND THE KOS OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH (MT 20:20-28; MK 10:35-45)

35. And Ya'akov and Yochanan, the banim of Zavdai, approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying to him, "Rebbe, we wish that whatever bakosha (request, pidyon nefesh) we may ask you, you may do for us."

36. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "What do you wish me to do for you?"

37. And they said to him, "Grant to us that one may sit limin of you (right hand) and one lismol (left hand) in the kavod of your kisse."

38. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "You do not have da'as of what you ask. Are you able to drink the kos which I drink or the tevilah in which I am submerged?" [Iyov 38:2]

39. And they said to him, "We are able."  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "The kos which I drink you shall drink; and you shall have the tevilah in which I am submerged.

40. "But to sit limin or lismol of me is not mine to grant, but for the ones for whom it has been prepared."

41. And hearing this, the Asarah (Ten) became indignant with Ya'akov and Yochanan.

42. And having summoned them, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "You have da'as that among the Goyim those whom they recognize as their moshlim (rulers) domineer them and their Gedolim exercise authority over them.

43. "However, it is not so among you. He who wishes to become gadol among you must be your mesharet."

44. And whoever wishes to be Rishon among you must be eved of all.

45. For even the Ben HaAdam (Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14) did not come to be served but to serve and to give his nefesh as a pedut ransom [for the Geulah] for many." [Yeshayah 53:10-11]  A MIRACLE: A JEWISH MAN ENABLED TO SEE REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH BEN DOVID (MT 20:29-34; 10:46-52; LK 18:35-43)

46. And they come to Yericho. And as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach  was going forth from Yericho with his talmidim and a great multitude, Bar-Timai [son of Timai], an ivver kabbetsan (a blind beggar) was sitting beside the road.

47. And when he heard that it was Yehoshua from Natzeret coming, he began to cry out and to shout, "Ben Dovid Yehoshua, chaneini!"

48. And many were rebuking him that he should shekit, but he kept crying out all the more, "Ben Dovid, chaneini!"

49. Having stopped, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Summon him here."  And they called the ivver, saying to him, "Chazak! Cheer up! He is calling you!"

50. And having tossed aside his kaftan, and having jumped up, he came to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

51. And in reply, Yehoshua said, "What do you wish that I may do for you?  And the ivver said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Rabboni, that I may see."

52. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Go, your emunah  has brought you tikkun." And ofen ort (immediately) he regained his sight  and he began following Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach baderech.

## Mark 11

1. And when they draw near to Yerushalayim at Beit-Pagey and  Beit-Anyah near the Mount of Olives, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sends two of his talmidim,

2. and says to them, "Go into the shtetl ahead of you, and ofen ort (immediately) as you enter it, you will find an AYIR (colt, Zecharyah 9:9) tied there, on which no one of men yet has ever sat; untie it and bring it here. [Bamidbar 19:2, Devarim 21:3, Shmuel Alef 6:7]

3. And if anyone says to you, `Why are you doing this?` you say `The Adon has need of it and will send it again here.`"

4. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's talmidim left and found an AYIR (Zecharyah 9:9) tied at the sha'ar outside on the rehkov. And they untied him.

5. And some of by-standers were saying to them, "What are you doing untying the AYIR?"

6. And the talmidim spoke to them just as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had instructed them.  And the by-standers permitted them.

7. And the talmidim brought the AYIR to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and they lay upon it their garments, and he sat upon it.

8. And many spread their garments on the derech, but others spread leafy branches they had cut from the sadot.

9. And the vanguard and rearguard of the procession were crying out, HOSHAN NAH (`Save now,` Tehillim 118:25-26) BARUCH HABAH B'SHEM ADONOI!

10. A berakhah on the coming Malchut Dovid Avinu!  Hoshan nah in the highest!

11. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach entered into Yerushalayim into the Beis HaMikdash and, having looked around at everything, and, the hour now being late, he went out to Beit-Anyah with the Shneym Asar.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH CLEANSES THE BEIS HAMIKDASH--THE AITZ TE'ENAH IS CURSED (MT 21:18-19; MT 11:12-18; LK 19:45-48)

12. And on the next day, when they came from Bethany, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was hungry.

13. And having seen in the distance an aitz te'enah (fig tree) in leaf, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach approached it to see whether he might find p'ri on it.  But when he came to it, he found nothing except leaves. For it was not the te'enim season.

14. And in reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to it, "May no one ever be nourished from p'ri from you again! And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's talmidim were listening.

15. Then they came to Yerushalayim.  And having entered the Beis HaMikdash, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began to drive out the ones buying and selling in the Beis HaMikdash, and he overturned the shulchanot (tables) of the machalifei hakesafim (money changers) and the chairs of the ones selling the yonim (doves).

16. And he was not allowing anyone to carry things through the Beis HaMikdash.

17. And he was teaching Torah and he was saying to them, "Has it not been written, BEITI BEIT TEFILLAH YIKAREI L'KHOL HA'AMMIM ("My House shall be called a House of Prayer [for] all peoples")  but you have made it a ME'ARAT PARITZIM ("den of robbers"). [Yeshayah 56:7; Yirmeyah 7:11]

18. And the Rashei Hakohanim (the Chief Priests) and the Sofrim (Scribes) heard this, and they were seeking how they might destroy him, for they were afraid of him, for all the multitude were amazed at his torah.  WHATEVER IS WITHOUT P'RI IN REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH IS CURSED--THE WITHERED AITZ TE'ENAH AND THE POWER OF EMUNAH (MT 21:19-22; MK 11:19-26; LK 21:37-38)

19. And when it became late, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and his talmidim went out of the city.

20. And in the boker early, as they passed by, they saw the aitz te'enah (fig tree) having been withered from [the] roots.

21. And, having remembered, Shimon Kefa says to him, "Rebbe, look, the aitz te'enah (fig tree) which you cursed has been withered."

22. And in reply Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "Have emunah in Hashem.

23. "Omein, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, be lifted up and be thrown into the sea, and does not waver in his lev but has emunah that what he says happens, so it will be for him.

24. "For this reason, I say to you, everything for which you daven tefillos, everything you request in prayer, have emunah that you have received it, and so it will be for you.

25. And when you stand davening, grant selicha if something you hold against someone, in order that your Avinu sh'baShomayim may grant you selicha for your peisha'im.

26.                         THE SAMCHUT OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH IS QUESTIONED BY THE SANHEDRIN (MT 21:23-46; 22:1-14; MK 11:27-12:12; LK 20:1-19)

27. And again they come into Yerushalayim. And in the Beis Hamikdash, [when] Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was walking about, the Rashei Hakohanim (the Chief Priests) and the Sofrim (Scribes) and the Zekenim come to him.

28. And they were saying to him, "By what kind of samchut do you do these things? Or who gave to you this samchut that you may do these things?"

29. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "I will ask you one dvar (question), and you answer me and I will tell you by what kind of samchut I do these things:

30. the tevilah [of teshuva] of Yochanan--was it from Shomayim or from bnei Adam? Answer me!"

31. And they were discussing among themselves, saying, "If we say, from Shomayim, he will say, `Why then did you not with him have emunah?'

32. "But [if] we say from bnei Adam?--they were afraid of the multitude, for everyone was considering Yochanan b'emes a navi.

33. And in reply to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, they say, "We do not have da'as."  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "Neither will I tell you by what kind of samchut I do these things."

## Mark 12

1. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began to speak to them in meshalim. "A man, a Ba'al Bayit, planted a kerem (vineyard), and   he put around [it] a fence and dug a pit for the yekev (winepress) and built a migdal (tower), and he leased it to koremim (vine-keepers) and then the man went on a journey. [Yeshayah 5:1-7]

2. "And the Ba'al Bayit sent to the tenants, the koremim, in the season [of Katsir] an eved in order that from the koremim he might receive from the perot of the kerem.

3. "But they seized the eved and they beat him and sent him away empty.

4. "And again the Ba'al Bayit sent to the tenants, the koremim, another eved; and that one they struck on the rosh and insulted.

5. "And the Ba'al Bayit sent another; and that one they killed, and many others, some beating, and others killing.

6. "Still he had one BEN AHUV [9:7]. Lemaskana (finally) the Ba'al Bayit sent him to them saying, `They will respect BENI.`

7. "But those koremim said to themselves, `This one is the Yoresh (Heir), the Bechor. Come, let us kill him, and the nachalah, the bechorah will be ours.`

8. "And having seized [him], they killed him and threw him out of the kerem.

9. "What then will the Ba'al Bayit of the kerem do?  He will come and destroy the koremim and will give the kerem to others.

10. Have you not read this Kitvei Hakodesh? "EVEN MA'ASU HABONIM HAY'TAH LEROSH PINAH; MEI'ET HASHEM HAY'TAH ZOT, HI NIFLAT B'EINEINU ("The stone which the ones building rejected, this one has come to be for [the] capstone of [the] corner."

11. "From Adonoi this came to be and it is wonderful in [the] our eyes?" [Tehillim 118:22,23]

12. And they were seeking to seize him, and they were afraid of the multitude, for they knew that against them he told the mashal. And leaving him, they went away.   

 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND HIS GAINSAYERS: AN ATTEMPT TO ENTRAP REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH CONCERNING TAXES AND CAESAR (MT 22:15-22; MK 12:13-17; LK 20:20-26)

13. And they send to him some of the Perushim and the Herodians in order that they might catch him in a dvar.

14. And having come, they say to him, "Rabbi, we have da'as that you are an ish of Emes and you do not show deference toward anyone.  Ki ein masso panim with you. but rather on the Derech Hashem you give Divrei Torah in Emes. Is it mutar (permissible) to give a poll tax to Caesar or not?  Should we give or should we not give?"

15. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having seen their tzevi'ut (hypocrisy), said to them, "Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius that I may look [at it]."

16. And they brought [one].  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "Whose demut is this and whose inscription?"  And they said to him, "Caesar's."

17. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "The things of Caesar, give to Caesar, and the things of Hashem [give] to Hashem." And they were amazed at Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach. THE SHEILAH (QUESTION) ABOUT THE TECHIYAS HAMESIM--A VAIN EFFORT TO CHALLENGE THE CHOCHMAH OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH; WHEN THE TZEDUKIM CALL HIM "RABBI" THEY INTEND IT AS A SHTOCH (MOCKING AND IRONIC JAB)  (MT 22:23-33; MK 12:18-27; LK 20:27-40)

18. And [the] Tzedukim come to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, the ones who say that there is not to be a Techiyas HaMesim, and they were questioning him, saying,

19. "Rabbi, Moshe (Rabbeinu) wrote to us that if an ACH of someone should die and leave behind an isha UVEN EIN LO ("and there is no son to him") YEVAMAH YAVO ALEIHA ULEKAKHAH LO L'ISHA V'HAYAH HABECHOR ASHER TELED YAKUM AL SHEM ACHIV HAMET ("the brother of her husband must come to her and he must take her to him as wife and the Bechor she bears shall raise up the name of the dead brother." Devarim 25:5)

20. "Now there were shiva achim. And the first took a wife and, dying, did not leave a descendant.

21. "And the second took her and he died, not having left behind a descendant. And the third likewise.

22. "And the shiva did not leave a descendant.

23. "In the Techiyas HaMesim, when they are made to stand up alive, of which of them will she be [the] isha? For shiva had her [as] wife."

24. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, said to them, "Is not this the reason you are in error, having da'as neither of the Kitvei Hakodesh nor of the gevurat Hashem?

25. "But concerning the Mesim that are made to stand up alive, they do not marry nor are they given in nissuin (marriage), but are like the malachim in Shomayim.

26. "But concerning the Mesim, that they are made to stand up alive, have you not read in the sefer of Moshe Rabbeinu at the bush, how Hashem spoke to him, saying, ANOCHI ELOHEI AVRAHAM ELOHEI YITZCHAK V'ELOHEI YA'AKOV ("I am the G-d of Avraham, the G-d of Yitzchak, and the G-d of Ya'akov," Shemot 3:6)

27. "Hashem is not the G-d of the Mesim but of the Chayyim. You are greatly mistaken." 


 THE TALMID CHACHAM (BA'AL TORAH) ASKS REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH TO POINT TO THE GREATEST MITZVAH (MT 22:34-40; MK 12:28-34)

28. And one of the Sofrim (Scribes) approached and heard them debating, and seeing that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answered them well, asked him, "Which mitzvah is rishonah of all the mitzvot?"

29. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answered, "SHEMA YISROEL ADONOY ELOHEINU ADONOY ECHAD is harishonah.

30. "V'AHAVTA ES ADONOY ELOHECHA B'KHOL L'VAVCHA UVECHOL NAFSHECHA UVECHOL M'ODECHA. [Devarim 6:4,5]

31. "And the shneyah is this, V'AHAVTA L'RE'A'CHA KAMOCHA [Vayikra 19:18].  There is not another mitzvah greater than these."

32. And the Ba'al Torah said to him, "Well spoken, Rabbi, b'emes you have said that Hashem is ECHAD, and EIN OD ("one [Devarim 6:4] and there is no other" [Yeshayah 45:18] except him. [Devarim 4:35,39; Yeshayah 45:6,14; 46:9]

33. "and to have ahavah for himBECHOL L'VAVCHA ("with all your heart") and with all your binah U'VECHOL M'ODECHA ("with all your strength" Devarim 6:5) and L'RE'ACHA KAMOCHA ("your neighbor as yourself" Vayikra 19:18) is greater [than] all of the burnt offerings and sacrifices." [Shmuel Alef 15:22; Hoshea 6:6; Michoh 6:6-8]

34. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, when he saw that this Torah teacher answered with chochmah said to him, "You are not far from the Malchut Hashem."  And no one was daring to put a sh'eilah in front of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach again.    REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH GIVES US THE TRUE DAAS TORAH INTERPRETATION OF TEHILLIM 110:1 (MT.22:41-46; MK 12:35-37; LK 20:41-44)

35. While Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying shiurim in the Beis Hamikdash, he was saying "How is it that the Sofrim (Scribes) say that Moshiach is [merely] ben Dovid?

36. "Dovid himself said by the Ruach Hakodesh, `NE'UM HASHEM L'ADONI: SHEV LIMINI, AD ASHIT OYVECHA HADOM L'RAGLECHA` ("Hashem said to my L-rd, Sit at the right of me, until I make your enemies a the footstool for your feet.") [Shmuel Bais 23:2; Tehillim 110:1]

37. "Dovid himself calls Moshiach `Adon;` how then is Moshiach [merely] ben Dovid?" And the large multitude found it a huge oneg to listen to him.  
 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH ATTACKS VAIN TRAPPINGS OF CHASHIVUT IN THE SHUL AS WELL AS ABUSES OF SAMCHUT (MK 12:38-40; LK 20:45-47)

38. And in his torah, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying, "Beware of the Sofrim (Scribes, Torah-teachers, rabbonim), the ones enamored of strutting about in extremely long kaftans and equally lengthy `Shalom' greetings in the marketplaces,

39. "and places of honor in the shuls and places of honor at the seudot (banquet dinners).

40. "Beware particularly of the ones devouring the batim (houses) of the almanot and making a grand show of davening long tefillos. Mishpat will fall more heavily on these." 
 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH COMMENTS ON THE ALMANAH AND HER TWO MITES (MK 12:41-44;LK 21:1-4)

41. And having sat [down] opposite the Beis Hamikdash Otzar (Treasury), Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was observing how the multitude throws copper [coins] into the Otzar. And many ashirim (rich people) were throwing [in] much. [Melachim Bais 12:9]

42. And a poor almanah came and threw [in] two leptas, which is a kodrantes.

43. And having summoned his talmidim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach   said to them, "Omein, I say to you that this poor almanah has put in more tzedakah than all those contributing to the Otzar,

44. "for everyone threw in from their abundance, but this almanah from her need has put in everything she had, all her michyah (subsistence)."

## Mark 13

1. And as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was going out from the Beis HaMikdash, one of his talmidim says to him, "Hinei!  Rebbe, what  large stones and impressive binyanim (buildings)!"  THE CHURBAN FORETOLD BY REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH

2. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, "Do you see these great binyanim?  Not one even (stone) will be left resting on another even (stone).  All will be thrown down!"

3. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the Beis HaMikdash having a yechidus with Kefa and Ya'akov and Yochanan and Andrew. THE BEGINNING OF THE CHEVLEI MOSHIACH

4. "Tell us when these things will be and what [will be] the ot (sign) when all these things are about to be consummated?"

5. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began to say to them, "Beware lest anyone deceive you.

6. For many will come in my name [arrogating my title and authority as Moshiach] saying "I am [here]."  And they will deceive many. [Yirmeyah 29:8]

7. "But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be troubled. It is necessary for these things to occur, but it is not yet HaKetz (the End [of the Olam Hazeh]).

8. "For there will be an intifada of ethnic group against ethnic group and malchut against malchut, there will be earthquakes in place after place, [and] there will be famines. These things are but the beginning of the Chevlei [Moshiach].

9. "But as for yourselves, take heed and be careful.  For they will hand you over to the sanhedrin and in the shuls you will be beaten and before moshlim (governors) and melachim (kings) you will take your stand for the sake of me [Moshiach] as a solemn edut (testimony) to them.

10. "And it is necessary that the Besuras HaGeulah first be proclaimed to all nations.

11. "And when they arraign you and hand you over for trial, do not be worried beforehand about what you might say, but whatever is given to you in that hour, this you shall say, for it is not you yourselves who are the ones speaking, but the Ruach Hakodesh.

12. "And ach will hand over ach to mavet, and Av [his] own yeled, and yeladim will rise up against horim and cause them to be condemned with onesh mavet. [Michoh 7:6]

13. "And everyone will hate you with sinas chinam (baseless hatred) because of my name [Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua]. But the one having endured to HaKetz this one will be receive Yeshu'at Eloheinu.

14. "And when you see the SHIKKUTS MESHOMEM ("the abomination of desolation," the abomination that causes desolation, Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) standing where it ought not --let the one reading this, take heed!--then let the ones in Yehudah flee to the mountains.

15. "And the one on the roof, let him not come down back inside and let him not enter his bais to take anything away.

16. "And the one in the sadeh (field) let him not turn back to get his kaftan.

17. "And oy to the ones "with child" and the ones with nursing infants yamim hahem.

18. "But daven tefillos that it may not occur in khoref (winter).

19. "For in those days will be Tzarah Gedolah (Great Tribulation) of such a kind as has not happened from [the] Reshit HaOlam (Beginning of Creation) which Hashem created until now and never again will be. [Daniel 9:26; 12:1; Yoel 2:2]

20. "And unless Hashem makes the yamim mekatzer (shortened), no one would be delivered in the Yeshu'at Eloheinu. But for the sake of the Bechirim (Chosen Ones), whom Hashem chose, he shortened the yamim.

21. "And, then, if someone says to you, "Hinei! Here [is] the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach!  Hinei! There!--do not have emunah in what they say.

22. "For meshichei sheker (false moshiachs) will arise, and nevi'ei sheker (false prophets), and they will perform otot and moftim so as to deceive and lead stray, if possible, the Bechirim. [Devarim 13:6,7,11,14]

23. "But you beware. I have forewarned you concerning all things.

24. "But after the Tzarah [13:19] of yamim hahem, the shemesh will be darkened, and the yare'ach will not give the ohr (light) of it,

25. "and the kokhavim (stars) will be falling out of Shomayim, and the kokhot, the ones in Shomayim [i.e. the cosmic structure],  will be shaken. [Yeshayah 13:10; 34:4; Yechezkel 32:7-8; Amos 8:9; Yoel 3:3f (2:30f)]

26. "And then you will see the BEN HAADAM BA BA'ANANIM ("the Son of Man [Moshiach] coming in clouds" Daniel 7:13-14) with gevurah rabbah and kavod.

27.  "And then he will send the malachim and he will gather together his Bechirim [13:20] from the four winds, from the ends (extremities) of ha'aretz to the ends (extremities) of Shomayim. [Zecharyah 2:6]  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH FORETELLS THE KETS HAOLAM HAZEH KAYITS HARVEST OF KLAL YISROEL, ESPECIALLY OF THE RELIGIOUS GEDOLIM WHO THEN WILL BE NO LONGER IN THE WINTER OF THE CURSE OF REJECTION [MARKOS 11:21] AS AT THE TIME OF THE CHURBAN, WHICH REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH ALSO FORETOLD [MARKOS 13:2]

28. "And from the aitz te'enah (fig tree) learn the mashal: when by that time its branch has become tender and it puts forth the leaves, you have da'as that Kayits (Summer) is near;

29. "So also you, when you see these things happening, have da'as that it is near, at the doors.

30.  "Omein, I say to you that by no means haDor HaZeh passes away until all these things take place.[Markos 13:24; Mattityahu 27:45]

31. "Shomayim and ha'aretz will pass away, but the dvarim of me [Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach] will by no means pass away.[Yeshayah 40:8]

32. "But concerning HaYom HaHu or the sha'ah, no one has da'as, neither the malachim in Shomayim nor HaBen, but only HaAv.

33.  "Beware, stay shomer, for you do not have da'as when the time is.

34.  "It is like a man, when departing on a journey and leaving his bais and, having put his avadim in charge, each with his assigned avodas, gives orders to the sho'er (gatekeeper) to be shomer."   UFITOM YAVO EL HEKHALO HAADON [REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH] ASHER ATEM MEVAKSHIM UMALACH HABRIT ASHER ATEM CHAFETZIM HINEH VA (MALACHI 3:1; CHAGGAI 2:7);  THIS MESSAGE IS FOR ALL ESCHATOLOGICAL YISROEL AND ALL THE BECHIRIM AND ALL MA'AMINIM IN MOSHIACH (MK 13:37), NOT FOR ONLY YEHUDIM OR YEHUDIM WITH EMUNAH IN REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH OR ONLY THE BRIT CHADASHA KEHILLAH, THIS MESSAGE IS FOR ALL--TAKE HEED!

35. "Therefore you be shomer, for you do not have da'as when the Ba'al Bayit comes, either late in the yom or at chatzot halailah  or at cockcrow or baboker,

36. "lest having come PITOM ("suddenly" Malachi 3:1) he finds you sleeping.

37. "And what I say to you, I say to all, be shomer."

## Mark 14

1. Now it was two days before the Pesach, the Chag HaMatzot. And the Rashei Hakohanim and the Sofrim were seeking how they might by ormah (cunning) do away with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

2. For they were saying, "Not at the Chag, for fear that a riot break out among the am ha'aretz."    

 AN ACTED NEVU'AH (PROPHECY): AN ISHA PREPARES HAGUF HAREBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH FOR KEVURAH (MT 26:6-13; MK 14:3-9; JO 12:2-8)

3. And he was in Beit-Anyah at the bais of Shimon the leper, reclining at tish, and an isha came, having an alabaster flask of costly mishcha (ointment), pure nard, and having broke open the alabaster flask, she poured [it on] the rosh of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

4. Now some were there who in ka'as said to one another, "For what reason has this waste of mishcha taken place?

5. "For this mishcha was able to be sold for more than three hundred denarii and to be given to the aniyim."  And they were reproaching her.

6. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Leave her alone. Why are you bringing about difficulty for the isha? Has she not performed one of the Gemilut Chasadim on me?

7. "For always the aniyim you have with you, and when you wish you are able to do ma'asim tovim for them, but me you do not always have. [Devarim 15:11]

8. "With what she had she did all she could. She prepared ahead of time to anoint my basar for the kevurah (burial) [Tehillim 16:9-10; Iyov 19:25-27; Yeshayah 53:11].

9. "And, omein, I say to you, wherever the Besuras HaGeulah is proclaimed in kol ha'aretz, also what this isha did will be spoken in zikaron of her."   BETRAYING THE REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH: THE ACT OF YEHUDAH FROM K'RIOT (MT 26:14-16; MK 14:10-11; LK 22:3-6)

10. And Yehudah from K'riot, one of the Shneym Asar, went to the Rashei Hakohanim (the Chief Priests) in order that he might betray him to them.

11. And there was chedvah (rejoicing) with the ones having heard and they gave the havtachah of a matnat kesef to Yehudah. And he was seeking how he might conveniently betray Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.  PREPARING FOR PESACH WITH REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH (MT 26:17-20; MK 14:12-17; LK 22:7-30)

12. And at the rishon of the Chag HaMatzot [when it was customary to prepare the Pesach Korban for mo'ed zevach], his talmidim say to him, "Where do you wish us to go and make the preparations for you to conduct the Seder?" [Shemot 12:1-11; Devarim 16:1-4]

13. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sends two of his talmidim and he says to them, "Go into the city, and you will meet a man carrying a jar of water; follow him;

14. "and wherever he enters, tell the Ba'al Bayit that the Rebbe says, "Where is my mekom linah (guest room) where I can conduct the Pesach Seder with my talmidim?

15. And he will show you a large upstairs room having been furnished and ready. And there prepare for us."

16. And the talmidim went out and they came into the city and found things just as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach told them, and they made preparations for Pesach.

17. And erev having come, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach arrives with the Shneym Asar.   THE NAMING OF THE BETRAYER (MT 26:21-25; MK 14:18-21; LK 22:21-23; JO 13:21-30)

18. And while they were at tish in a yechidus, reclining and eating, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Omein, I say to you, that one of you will betray me, OKHEL LACHEMI ("the one eating my bread" Tehillim 41:10 (9).  THE TIME OF CHESHBON HANEFESH OF THE SHLUCHIM AND THE BEDIKAS CHOMETZ OF DENIAL AND BETRAYAL

19. They began to have agmat nefesh, and, one by one, to say to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Sure I am not the one?"

20. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "It is one of the Shneym Asar, the one dipping with me into the bowl [SHEMOT 12:8].

21. "For the Ben HaAdam [Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14] goes just as it has been written concerning him [Yeshayah 53:3; Daniel 9:26; Zecharyah 12:10; Tehillim 41:10 (9)], but woe to that man through whom the Ben HaAdam is betrayed. [It would have been] better for him if that man had not been born."   REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S FINAL HAMOTZI AND BERAKHAH AT HIS SEUDAH (MT 26:26-29; MK 14:22-25; LK 22:17-20)

22. And at the Seudah, while they were eating, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having taken the matzah, having made the ha-Motzi, he offered the betzi'at halechem (breaking of the bread) and gave to them, and said, "Take and eat, this is my BASAR. [SHEMOT 12:8]" THE FINAL KIDDUSH IN ZACHOR (REMEMBRANCE) OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH WHOSE TZAVVAAH (LAST WILL) IS THE BRIT CHADASHA KAPPARAH FOR OUR SELICHA (FORGIVENESS) AND DEVEKUS (COMMUNION WITH G-D)

23. And having taken the Kiddush Cup (Kos) [and] having made the berakhah, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gave the Kiddush Cup to them, and everyone drank of it.

24. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "HINEI DAHM HABRIT (SHEMOT 24:8), the dahm of me (Moshiach), which is being poured out lama'an RABBIM (for the sake of "MANY" Yeshayah 53:11).

25. "Omein, I say to you, that no longer will I by any means drink of the p'ri hagefen (fruit of the vine) until Yom HaHu when I drink it chadash (new) in the Malchut Hashem."

26. And having sung the Hallel, they went out to the Mount of Olives.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S TALMIDIM TOLD THAT THEY WILL BE SCATTERED (MT 26:31-35; MK 14:27-31; LK 22:31-38); KEFA ASSERTS THAT EVEN IF ALL BECOME SHMAD DESERTERS, NEVERTHELESS HE WILL STAND FIRM; THE HAKHCHASHAH FORETOLD

27. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "All of you will fall away, for it has been written, "I will strike down ES HARO'EH UTEFUTEN HATZON ("the Shepherd and the sheep will be scattered"). [Zecharyah 13:7]

28. "But after I am made to stand up alive (Moshiach's Techiyas HaMesim), I will go before you into the Galil."

29. But Shimon Kefa said to him, "Even if everyone will fall away, yet I will not."

30. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, "Omein, I say to you, that you today, balailah hazeh (during this night) before the tarnegol crows twice, you will make hakhchashah (denial) of me shalosh pa'amim (three times).

31. But Kefa kept saying with vehemence, "If it is neccessary for me to die for you al kiddush ha-Shem, by no means will I make hakhchashah (denial) of you." And likewise also everyone declared.  THE FINAL TEMPTATION OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH; THE ADAM HECHADASH IN THE GAN HANISYONOS (GARDEN OF TEMPTATION) GAINS THE ESCHATOLOGICAL MESSIANIC TITZACHON (VICTORY) (BERESHIS 3:1-6; MT 26:36-40; MK 14:32-42; LK 22:39-46; JO 18:1)

32. And they come to a place of which the name [was] Gat-Sh'manim and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to his talmidim, "Sit down here while I daven."

33. And he takes Kefa and Ya'akov and Yochanan with him and he began to be distressed and to be troubled.

34. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, "My agmat nefesh is great, even to the point of mavet. Remain here and stay awake and shomer."

35. And having gone forth a little, he was falling on the ground and was davening tefillos that, if it is possible, this sha'ah might pass from him."

36. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying, "Abba, Avi, all things [are] possible for you. Take away this KOS [YESHAYAH 51:17] from me. But not what I will, but what you [will]."

37. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach comes and finds them sleeping, and he says to Shimon Kefa, "Are you sleeping? Were you not chozek to stay awake one hour?

38. "Stay shomer and daven that you may not enter lidey nisayon. Indeed the ruach [is] ready but the basar [is] weak."

39. And again Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went away and davened the same dvarim as before.[14:36]

40. And once again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were falling shut, and they did not have da'as of what they might answer him.

41. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach comes the shlishit (third) time and says to them, "Sleep [for] the remainder and take your rest. It is enough. The sha'ah has come.  Hinei, the Ben HaAdam is betrayed in the hands of chote'im.

42. "Get up, let us go. Behold the one betraying me has drawn near."     THE HANDING OVER OF THE SEH HAELOHIM, REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH, THE PESACH KORBAN  (MT 26:47-56;  MK 14:43-52; LK 22:47-53; JO 18:2-12; YESHAYAH 53:7)

43. And, ofen ort (immediately), bishas maise (at the same time) Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach is speaking, Yehudah arrives, one of the Shneym Asar, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs with Rashei Hakohanim (the Chief Priests) and the Sofrim (Scribes) and the Zekenim.

44. Now the one betraying Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had given a signal to them, saying, "Whomever I may give the neshikah (kiss), he is [the one], seize him, and lead [him] away under guard."

45. And when he came, he ofen ort (immediately) approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and says, "Rebbe," and he gave him the neshikah."

46. And they laid their hands on him and arrested him.

47. But one of those standing by drew his cherev and struck the servant of the Kohen Gadol and cut off his ear.

48. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answered and said to them, "Do you come out swords and clubs as against a ganav to arrest me?

49. "Every day I was with you in the Beis HaMikdash teaching Torah and you did not arrest me; but let the Kitvei Hakodesh be fulfilled." [Yeshayah 53:7-12]

50. And, having left Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, everyone fled.

51. And a certain bochur was following along with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and the bochur was wearing nothing but a linen garment around his naked body, and they seized the bochur.

52. But the bochur ran away naked, leaving the linen garment behind.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH BEFORE THE SANHEDRIN, THE BEGINNING OF HIS TZA'AR (PAIN AND SUFFERING): CONDEMNED ON THE BASIS OF PERJURED EDUT (MT 26:57-68; MK 14:53-65; LK 22:54, 63-65; JO 18:24)

53. And they led away Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to the Kohen Gadol and all the Rashei Hakohanim (the Chief Priests) and the Zekenim and the Sofrim (Scribes) were assembled.

54. And Shimon Kefa from a distance followed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach right into the courtyard of the Kohen Gadol.  And Kefa was sitting together with the servants and warming himself near the ohr of the aish.

55. And the Rashei Hakohanim (the Chief Priests) and [the] entire Sanhedrin were seeking edut (testimony) against Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach in order to bring the onesh mavet, and they were not finding any.

56. For many gave edut sheker against Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and the eduyot (testimonies) were not in agreement.

57. And some, taking the stand, were giving edut sheker against him, saying,

58. "We heard him saying, `I will bring churban to this Beis Hamikdash made with human hands, and, after shalosha yamim, another, not made with hands, I will build."

59. So their eduyot was not identical.

60. And having stood up in their midst, the Kohen Gadol questioned Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, "Do you not answer anything to what these bear solemn edut (testimony) against you?"

61. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was silent and did not answer anything. [Yeshayah 53:7-8]  Again the Kohen Gadol was questioning him and says to him, "Are you the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, HaBen Hamevorakh?"

62. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, "Ani hu, and you will see the BEN HAADAM [Daniel 7:13-14] YOSHEV LIMIN HaGevurah [Tehilllim 110:1] UVA IM ANENEI HASHOMAYIM" ("the Ben HaAdam [Moshiach] sitting at the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven").

63. And the Kohen Gadol, making the keriah (ritual tearing) of his tunic, says, "What further need do we have of edim? [Vayikra 10:6; 21:10; 24:16; Bamidbar 14:6]

64. "You heard him commit Chillul Hashem gidduf (blasphemy). How does it seem to you?" And they all condemned Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to be deserving of mishpat mavet. [Vayikra 24:16]

65. And some began to spit on Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and to cover his face and to strike him and to say to him, "Let's hear a dvar nevu'ah!" And the shomrim took custody of him by slapping Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.  KEFA MAKES HAKHCHASHAH (DENIAL) OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH        (MT 26:58,69-75; 14:54,66-72; LK 22:54-62; JO 18:15-18,25-27)

66. And Shimon Kefa being below in the courtyard, one of the maids of the Kohen Gadol comes by.

67. And having seen Kefa warming himself, having looked him over, she says, "You also were with the one from Natzeret, Yehoshua!"

68. But he denied [it], saying, "I do not have da'as nor binah of what you are saying." And he walked away and went outside into the entryway and a tarnegol crowed.

69. And the maid, having seen him, began again to say to the ones having stood by, "This one is one of them!"

70. But again he made hakhchashah (denial). And after a little [while] again the ones having stood by were saying to Kefa, "You are one of them, for indeed you are a Gelili" (inhabitant of the Galil).

71. And Kefa began to speak a kelala and to swear, "I do not have da'as of this man--I don't know the one of whom you speak!"

72. And ofen ort (immediately), for a second time, a tarnegol crowed. And then Kefa remembered the dvar that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had spoken to him, "Before a tarnegol crows twice, shalosh pe'amim (three times) you will make hakhchashah (denial) of me." (Markos 14:30). And having broken down, Kefa was weeping.

## Mark 15

1. And as soon as it was boker, the Rashei Hakohanim (the Chief Priests) with the Zekenim and Sofrim (Scribes) and [the] entire Sanhedrin, having performed the akedah (binding) of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, led [him] away and handed [him] over to Pilate. [Bereshis 22:9] REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH BEFORE PILATE (MT 27:3-14; MK 15:2-5;  LK 23:1-5; JO 18:28-38)

2. And Pilate questioned Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, "Are you the Melech haYehudim?" And, in reply, he says, "You say so."

3. And the Rashei Hakohanim were accusing Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach [of] many things.

4. And Pilate again questioned him, saying, "Do you not answer anything? Look how many things they accuse you [of]."

5. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach no longer answered anything, so Pilate was astounded. [Yeshayah 53:7]  THOUGH IT IS PESACH AND NOT YOM KIPPUR, REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH FULFILLS A YOM KIPPUR MOTIF IN THE QUESTION OF KAPPARAH IN TWO "SONS OF THE FATHER," ONE FOR HASHEM, ONE FOR AZAZEL (VAYIKRAH 16:6-9); MOSHIACH MA SHE-EIN KEIN BAR-ABBA

6. Now [at] every Chag he was releasing to them one prisoner for whom they were making request.

7. Now there was the one being called Bar-Abba, who had been imprisoned with his fellow insurrectionists and who, at the time of the Mered (Revolt, Uprising), had committed retzach (murder).

8. So the crowd came and began to ask Pilate to do for them just as in the past was his custom.

9. But Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you wish [that] I should release to you the Melech haYehudim?"

10. For Pilate knew that because of kinah (envy) the Rashei Hakohanim had handed him over to him.

11. But the Rashei Hakohanim incited the crowd that Pilate should instead release Bar-Abba to them.

12. But Pilate, in reply again, was saying to them, "What then do you wish [that] I should do with the one whom you call the Melech HaYehudim?"

13. And again they cried out, "Let him be hanged on HaAitz!" [Devarim 21:22]

14. But Pilate was saying to them, "Why? What ra'ah has he committed?" But they all the more cried out, "Let him be hanged on HaAitz!" [Devarim 21:22]

15. So Pilate, desiring to placate the crowd, released to them Bar-Abba, and handed over Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to be scourged [with the flagellum] and to be hanged on HaAitz. [Devarim 21:22]
 REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S KETER OF THORNS [YESHAYAH 53:6]; THE  COHORT OF THE ARMY OF THE GOYIM IS GATHERED AGAINST MOSHIACH (TEHILLIM 2:1-2)

16. And the chaiyalim (soldiers) led away Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach into the courtyard, which is [the] Praetorium, the governor's headquarters, and they called together [the] whole cohort.

17. And they clothe him [in royal] purple and place upon him a keter of thorns that they had woven together.

18. And they began to greet Him, "Hail, Melech HaYehudim!"

19. And they were striking him [on] the rosh  with a staff and they were spitting on him and bending their knees and bowing down before him. [Tehillim 22:8,17]

20. After mocking him, they stripped him of [royal] purple and clothed him in his garments. And they lead him out that they might pierce him and hang him on HaAitz. [Devarim 21:22]  BEING PRESSED INTO SERVICE TO HELP BEAR REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S AITZ (MT 27:31-34; MK 15:20-23; LK 23:26-33; JO 19:16-17)

21. And a certain Shimon from Cyrene was passing by, who was coming in from [the] countryside.  He was the father of Alexander and Rufus. The chaiyalim requisition him in order that he might carry Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's Aitz . [Devarim 21:23; 27:26; Yeshayah 53:4-5]  THE HAGBA (LIFTING UP) OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH (MT 27:35-50; MK 15:24-37; LK 23:33-46; JO 19:18-30)

22. And they bring Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to a place called Gulgotha, which means, being translated, `Place of the Skull.`

23. And they were giving to him yayin having been mixed with myrrh, but this one did not take it. [Tehillim 69:22 (21); Mishle 31:6]

24. And they hanged Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach on HaAitz and YICHALLEKU VEGADAI ("they divide the garments") of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and VAPPILU GORAL ("they cast lots") for them, to decide what each might take." [Tehillim 22:19(18)]

25. Now it was [the] third hour when they hanged Rebbe, Melech  HaMoshiach on HaAitz.

26. And the inscription of the charge against him was inscribed above his rosh, "HaMelech HaYehudim."

27. And with him they also nailed, each to his own aitz, shnei shodedim, one on [the] right and one on [the] left of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

28.  

29. And the ones passing by were reviling him and shaking their heads and saying, "Ha! The one bringing churban on the Beis HaMikdash and rebuilding [it] in shalosha yamim, [Tehillim 22:7; 109:25]

30. "Save yourself! Come down from the aitz!

31. "Likewise, also, the Rashei Hakohanim along with the Sofrim were also mocking him, saying. "He saved others, but himself he is not able to save." [Tehillim 22:7]

32. "Let the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, let the Rebbe Melech Yisroel, let [him] come down now from the aitz, in order that we may see and have emunah!"  And the ones having been hanged on the aitz on either side of him were reproaching him. [Markos 8:31]

33. And when the sixth hour came [high noon], it became choshech over kol ha'aretz until [the] ninth hour. [Amos 8:9]

34. And at the ninth hour, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach cried out in a kol gadol, "Eloi, Eloi lamah sabachthani?" which means, being translated, "ELI ELI LAMAH AZAVTANI? ("My G-d, my G-d,  why have you forsaken me?" [Tehillim 22:1]

35. And some of the ones having been standing nearby and having heard, were saying, "Hinei! He calls for Eliyahu HaNavi!"

36. And someone having run and having filled a sponge with CHOMETZ ("vinegar" Tehillim 69:21), and having placed it on a staff, gave a drink to him, saying, "Leave him alone.  Let us see if Eliyahu Hanavi comes to take him down."

37. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having uttered a kol gadol and having breathed his last, expired.

38. And the parochet [in the Heikhal] in the Beis haMikdash was torn in two from top to bottom.

39. And the centurion, having stood nearby opposite Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and having seen that he expired this way, said "Truly, this man was the Ben HaElohim!"

40. And there were also nashim looking on from a distance, among whom [were] Miryam from Magdala, and Miryam the Imma of the younger Ya'akov and of Yosi, and Shlomit. [Tehillim 38:11]

41. They were with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach in the Galil and they had been following him [as talmidat] and serving him, and there were many other Jewish women who with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had made their aliyah leregel up to Yerushalayim.        REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S OWN CHEVRAH KADDISHA FORMS TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE KEVURAH OF THE NIFTAR  (MT 27:57-60; MK 15:42-46; LK23:50-54; JO 19:31-42)

42. And already, erev fast approaching, vi-bahlt (since) it was Preparation Day, which is the day before Shabbos,

43. Yosef of Ramatayim, a member of the Sanhedrin and a man of chashivut (prominence) there, a man who was also himself looking forward to the Malchut Hashem, had the chozek to go into Pilate and ask for the guf Yehoshua.

44. And Pilate was amazed that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was already niftar, and Pilate summoned the centurion to question him whether Yehoshua was niftar already.

45. And having found out from the centurion, he gave the geviyah (corpse) to Yosef.

46. And having bought tachrichim linen cloths and having taken Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach down, he wrapped him in the tachrichim  and placed him in a kever which had been cut from rock, and he rolled a stone against the entrance of the kever.

47. And Miryam of Magdala and Miryam the Imma of Yosi were observing [as eye-witnesses] of where Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach  had been laid.

## Mark 16

1. And when Shabbos had ended, Miryam Magdalene and Miryam Imma of Ya'akov, and Shlomit bought spices in order that they might go and anoint him.

2. And at Shachrit on Yom Rishon, the first day of the shavu'a (week), the shemesh just coming up, they come to the kever.

3. And they were saying to themselves, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the kever?"

4. And having looked up, they observe that the stone, which was extremely large, had already been rolled aside!

5. And having entered into the kever, they saw a young man enrobed in white, sitting on the right side, and they were shocked with astonishment.

6. But he says to them, "Do not be alarmed.  You seek Yehoshua from Natzeret, who has been hanged on HaAitz. He has been made to stand up alive.  He is not here. Hinei!  The place where they laid him.

7. But go tell his talmidim and Kefa that he goes before you into the Galil. There you will see him, just as he told you."

8. And having gone out, they fled from the kever, and trembling and amazement seized them. And they told no one anything for they were afraid.

9. And now after Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach arose early on Yom Rishon, he appeared rishonah to Miryam of Magdala, from whom he had cast out shiva shedim.

10. She went out and announced to the ones who had been with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach while they were in avelut (mourning) and weeping.

11. And those who heard that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach lives and he was seen by her, refused to have emunah.

12. And after these things, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach appeared in another demut to shenayim of them walking along into the country.

13. And those having gone reported to the rest, but the rest did not have emunah either.

14. But later Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach appeared to the Achad Asar themselves, reclining at tish, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach reproached them for their lack of emunah and the KESHI [stubbornness, hardness DEVARIM 9:27] of their levavot, because they had no bittachon in those who saw Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach after he had been made to stand up alive.

15. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, "Go into kol haOlam, and proclaim the Besuras HaGeulah to all HaBri'ah.

16. "The one having had emunah and having submitted to a tevilah of teshuva will be delivered in the Yeshu'at Eloheinu, but the one not having emunah will come under the gezar din (verdict) of haresha'ah (condemnation as guilty).

17. "And these otot will accompany those that have emunah. Bishmi (In my name) they will cast out shedim; they will speak with leshonot chadashot (Acts 2:4);

18. "And with their hands they will pick up nechashim (Acts 28:3-5); and, if any deadly poison they drink, it will in no way harm them; upon [the] cholim they will lay their hands and they will bring them refu'ah."  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH IS TAKEN UP INTO SHOMAYIM (LK 24:50-53; ACTS 1:9-11)

19. And then Adoneinu Yehoshua, after speaking to them, was taken up into Shomayim and V'YASHAV LIMIN HASHEM ("sat down at the right hand of Hashem." [Tehillim 110:1])

20. And those having gone forth preached the Hachrazah (Proclamation, kyrygma) everywhere, [while] Adonoi was working with them, confirming through the accompanying otot.
