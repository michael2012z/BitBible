# Philippians

## Philippians 1

1. From Sha'ul and Timotiyos, servants of Rebbe, Melech  HaMoshiach Yehoshua;  To all the kedoshim in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua who are in the city of Philippi with the supervising mashgichim ruchaniyim (spiritual overseers, zekenim, mivakkerim, supervisors) and the klei kodesh (ministers), the ministering messianic shammashim.

2. Chen v'chesed Hashem and shalom Hashem from Elohim Avinu and Adoneinu Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua.  MOSHIACH'S SHLIACH AND HIS TEFILLAH FOR THE KEHILLAH IN PHILIPPI [A ROMAN COLONY LOCATED IN MACEDONIA WHICH IS IN THE BALKAN PENINSULA, NORTH OF ANCIENT GREECE, AND IS WHERE RAV SHA'UL WAS LED ALSO TO THESSALONICA AND BEREA AND TO HIS MINISTRY THERE (SEE ACTS 16:9-17:13]; HIS HANACHA (PREMISE) IS THAT HASHEM HAS BEGUN A MITZVAH IN THE PHILIPPIANS; HIS DIYUK (LOGICAL CONCLUSION) IS THAT HASHEM WILL COMPLETE IT

3. Modeh Ani (I thank) my G-d upon every zikaron (remembrance) of you,

4. always in every tefillah of mine on behalf of all of you, davening with simcha, making techinah (supplication)

5. in view of your devekut Hashem, your chavrusa partnership in the Besuras HaGeulah from day one until now.

6. Being convinced of this:  that He who began a pe'ulah hatovah (good action 2:13) in you, will bring that mitzvoh to completion [Tehillim 138:8] by Yom Hashem, the Yom Adoneinu, Moshiach Yehoshua [1:10; 2:16].

7. It is in fact b'tzedek for me to have hitbonanut (profound contemplation-4:8-9) about you all because you hold me in your levavot with hartzige sincerety, both in regard to my kaval (chain/fetter) and in the apologetic and vindicatory work for the Besuras HaGeulah, you being all devekut (attachment to G-d) participators in the Chen v'Chesed Hashem given to me.

8. For Hashem 'ed (G-d is my witness) how I yearn for all of you with the ahavas Moshiach Yehoshua.

9. And my tefillah is this, that your ahavah [in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach] may yet increase more and more in profound da'as and binah (binah)

10. to help you approve the feste (excellent) things of musar (moral discipline) that matter, that you may be barei lev (pure in heart) and without michshol (stumbling block) of blame [2:15] in the Yom HaMoshiach [1:6; 2:16],

11. having been filled with the p'ri Tzedek (fruit of righteousness) through Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua to the kavod Hashem and his tiferet. SHA'UL LIFTS THE KOS OF L'CHAYIM: "TO ME TO LIVE IS REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH"; THE MATURE KNOW THAT HE IS KOVUA (ESTABLISHED, FIRMLY SET) BY HASHEM IN ROME FOR THE APOLOGETIC DEFENSE OF THE BESURAS HAGEULAH

12. I want you to have da'as, Achim b'Moshiach, that the things concerning me have come to an even greater advancement (1:25) of the Besuras HaGeulah [II Tim.2:9].

13. So that my kaval (chain/fetter--1:7) has been made hitgalut in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach!  In all the imperial guard and the public at large!

14. And most of the Achim b'Adoneinu, having been strengthened in bittachon by my kaval (chain/fetter), are more readily willing to dare to fearlessly proclaim the Dvar Hashem.

15. Indeed some darshanim (preachers) preach their derashot (sermons) out of a ruach that is mekanne (jealous, envious) and of madon (strife); but some have derashot proclaiming Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and these darshanim have kavvanah tovah (good intention).

16. These latter proclaim Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach out of a ruach of ahavah, having da'as that the purpose of my divinely destined appointment here is for the apologetic defense of the Besuras HaGeulah.

17.  But those other ones preach Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach out of anochiyut (selfishness--2:3), not with a lev tahor (pure in heart) motive, lu yetzuuyar (assuming) by means of my kaval (1:13-14) to stir up tzoros.

18. Nu? Whether the maggidim are or are not perfect in their intent, the significant thing is that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach is preached!  And in this I have simcha. And I will go right on having simcha!
 AS HAMOSHIACH'S SHLIACH TO THE GOYIM CONTEMPLATES HIS POSSIBLE IMMINENT KIDDUSH HA-SHEM MARTYRDOM, HIS FINAL CONCLUSION IS GAM HU LI LISHU'AH (IYOV 13:16) THROUGH THE TECHINAH (SUPPLICATION) OF THE KEHILLAH AND THROUGH THE DIVINE EZRAH; HOWEVER, WHETHER IN LIFE OR IN DEATH, MIMUH NIFSHACH (EITHER WAY), HE WINS IN MOSHIACH

19. For, I have da'as that through your tefillos for me and through the ezrah (aid) given by the Ruach Moshiach, this will turn out for my Yeshu'ah (rescue--1:28; 2:12) [Rom.8:28].

20. It is my confident tikvah that in nothing I will be put to bushah (shame), but with all ometz (courage--Yehoshua 1:7) as always, even now, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach will be magnified in my guf (body) (1:13), whether through Chayyah (Life) or through Mavet (Death).

21. For to me to live is Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach [Gal.2:20] and to die is revach (gain, profit, hanaa).

22.  But if it means I am to go on living in the basar, this for me is p'ri for Hashem in the work of avodas kodesh.  What will I choose?  I do not have da'as.

23. I am kleir. I am pulled two drakhim (ways) by a happy dilemma, on the one tzad (side) having the desire to depart and be with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, for this is much better [II Cor.5:8].

24. But on the other tzad (side) to remain in the basar is more necessary for your sake.

25. And  having been convinced of this fact, I have da'as that I blaib (remain, continue unchanged) and will continue with all of you, for your advancement (1:12) and simcha of the [orthodox Jewish] Emunah [cf. 1:27; I Tim.3:9; 4:1,6; 5:8; 6:10,21; Jude 3],

26. with the ultimate aim that by coming to you again your glorying may abound in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua.          

 THE ACHDUT (UNITY) OF MOSHIACH'S KEHILLAH; YOUR FEARLESSNESS SAYS TO YOUR MITNAGGEDIM: HARAYA! (THAT PROVES IT!) YOU ARE LOST!

27. Only one thing: carry out in practice the torat haEzrakhut (citizenship--see 3:20) worthily of the Besuras HaGeulah of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.  Then, whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear concerning you that you are standing like a ma'oz (fortress) in one ruach, with one nashamah, contending for the Emunah (Jude 3; Php 4:3) of the Besuras HaGeulah.

28.  And, I might add, not having pakhad (fear, terror) in reaction to anything as far as the mitnaggedim (the ones opposing) are concerned, which is a proof to them of their churban (destruction), but of your Yeshu'ah (salvation--1:19; 2:12], and this from Hashem.

29. For to you it was given on behalf of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, not only to have emunah in him but also on behalf of him to be laden with the burden of Messianic innuyim (sufferings--3:10),

30. with your having the same struggle, which you saw in me [Acts 16:22] and now hear to be in me [1:13].

## Philippians 2

1. If, therefore, there is any idud (encouragement) in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, if any nechamah (comfort) of ahavah (love), if any devekut (attachment to G-d) in shutafut (partnership, association) of the Ruach Hakodesh, if any warmth of affection and rachamanut (compassion, mercy),

2. then make my simcha (joy) shleimah (complete) by having the same lev, the same ahavah, an agudah (union, association) with one neshamah, thinking the same makhshavot (thoughts),

3. doing nothing according to anochiyut (selfishness--1:17) nor according to empty gaiva (conceit, haughtiness, arrogance), but in anavah (humility), fergin (graciously grant) each other esteem above yourselves [Rom.12:10].

4. Let each of you look after not only your own interests, but also the best interests of others [2:21; I Cor.10:24,33].

5. Let this thinking be in you which was also in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua,

6. who, though existing in the demut of the mode of being of Elohim [his etzem or essential nature, Joh.1:1-2; 17:5], did not regard being equal with G-d as a thing to be seized (thought it not gezel, robbery)[Bereshis 3:5],

7. but poured out and emptied himself [II Cor.8:9], taking the demut of the mode of being of a servant [Yeshayah 52:13-53:12], and was born in the likeness of bnei Adam [Joh.1:14; Rom.8:3; Heb.2:14-17], and having been found in appearance as an Adam,

8. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach humbled himself, unto mishma'at (obedience--2:12)  [cf. Bereshis 3:17] even unto death [Joh.10:17; Heb.5:8; 12:2], and that, a death on the Aitz [Devarim 21:23; 27:26; Gal.3:13; Php.3:18].

9. Therefore, also Hashem exalted [Yeshayah 52:13; 53:12; Dan.7:14; Acts 2:33; Heb.1:3] Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and gave to him ha-Shem [Eph.1:21; Heb.1:4] above every name,

10. that at  ha-Shem of Yehoshua, KOL BERECH (every knee--YESHAYAH 45:23) will bow, of beings b'Shomayim (Shomayim) and ba'Aretz (on the earth) and mitachat laAretz (in the world below),

11. and KOL LASHON (every tongue--YESHAYAH 45:23) shall make hoda'ah (confession) with an Ani Ma'amin that is an open and public admission that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua is Adoneinu, to the kavod of Elohim Avinu.   VAYILONU "AND THEY MURMURED' SHEMOT 15:24; 16:2; 17:3; BAMIDBAR 14:2,29; 16:41; AVOID MURMURING AND DIVISION, REMEMBERING THAT THE OHR HAOLAM IS MOSHIACH IN US

12. Therefore, Chaverim, just as you have always had mishma'at (obedience--2:8) concerning me, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own Yeshu'ah [1:19,28] B'YIR'AH ("with fear") and BIRA'DAH "with trembling" [TEHILLIM 2:11].

13. For Hashem is the one working in you, both to will and to work kirtzono (according to His will). [Ezra 1:5]

14. Do all things without murmurings and arguments,

15. that you may be barei lev (pure in heart) and without michshol (stumbling block) of blame [1:10], bnei haElohim TAMIM U'MUM ("unblemished and unspotted"--SHEMOT 12:5; VAYIKRA 22:20; YESHAYAH 53:7-9) in the midst of a DOR IKKESH UFETALTOL ("warped and crooked generation--DEVARIM 32:5), among whom you shine as the ZOHAR (DANIEL 12:3) in the Olam Hazeh,

16. holding fast the Dvar haChayyim.  This is so that I will have reason for glorying on the Yom HaMoshiach [1:6,10], that I neither ran nor labored L'TOHU (in vain) [Yeshayah 49:4; 65:23].

17. And, indeed, if my neshamah is to be poured out as a nesekh (libation wine) offering upon the korban (sacrifice) of the avodas kodesh (kohen's service, ministry) of your emunah, I have simcha, rejoicing together with you all [cf.Rom.15:16; II Tim.4:6].

18. And in the same way also you have simcha, rejoicing together with me [l:4,18; 1:25; 2:2,17].   SEEING A MAILA (COMMENDABLE TRAIT): THE MOFET (EXAMPLE) OF RAV SHA'UL'S BEHELFER (ASSISTANT) TIMOTIYOS (A ZARIZ STALWART) AND EPAPHRODITUS: BITTUL HAYESH (ABANDONMENT OF SELF) IN DEVEKUT (CLEAVING TO G-D) THROUGH REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S INNUYIM (SUFFERINGS): ZERIZUT (DILIGENCE) AS A PORTRAIT OF SELFLESSNESS; RAV SHA'UL BEDOICHEK (RELUCTANTLY) SENDS EPAPHRODITUS TO PHILIPPI

19. I have tikvah b'Adoneinu Yehoshua to send Timotiyos to you soon, that I also may be cheered up in the da'as of the things concerning you.

20. For I have no one like-minded who will emesdik (genuinely) care for your spiritual welfare.

21. All of them are seeking their own interests [2:4], not those of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua.

22. But of the proven mamashus (real worth) of Timotiyos you have da'as, because as a ben with his Abba, Timotiyos served with me in the Besuras HaGeulah.

23. Therefore, I have tikvah to send him, as soon as I see how the things will go with me.

24. But I have bittachon in Hashem that indeed I will come quickly.

25. But I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, the Ach b'Moshiach and fellow po'el (worker) and fellow chaiyal (soldier) of mine, but the shliach and keli kodesh (minister) of my need [4:18].

26. I am sending him to you, because he was yearning after you all and was under zeiyar great stress, because you heard that he was ill.

27. For indeed he was sick, coming near to death, but Hashem had mercy on him--not on him only but also on me, lest I should have agmat nefesh (grief) upon agmat nefesh.

28. Therefore, I am all the more eager to dispatch him to you, in order that when you have seen him again, you may have simcha and I may have less agmat nefesh.

29. Therefore, receive him in Adoneinu with all simcha and hold esteem for such klei kodesh (ministers) [I Cor.16:16,8; I Tim.5:17],

30. because he came near to death on account of the avodas HaMoshiach, having risked his life, that he might make up for the ministry to me that you could not give.

## Philippians 3

1. As to the rest, Achim b'Moshiach of mine, have simcha in Adoneinu [1:25; 2:18,28,29; 4:4].  To keep writing the zelba thing [l:4,18; 1:25; 2:2,17, 18, 28,29] to you is not an irksome bother to me, but for you it is a safe-guard.

2. Be shomer and on your guard and watch out for those [unclean, prowling] kelevim (dogs--Tehillim 22:17(16),20; Rev.22:15), watch out for the evil po'alim (workers), watch out for the circumutilators (Gal.6:12).

3. For we are the Bnei haMilah [Rom.2:29; Col.2:11-12], the ones whose avodas kodesh is by the Ruach Hakodesh [Joh.4:23; Rom.8:4] and whose kavod is in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua and who take no bittachon in the basar.  AS TO HIDDUR MITZVAH (CAREFUL AND PUNCTILIOUS OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW) IN TORAH-JUDAISM, PUT ME DOWN AS FRUMEH YIDDEN, CHAREIDI, SHOMER DATI, A HEILIGER YID (HOLY JEW) WITH PEYOT, BEKESHE AND SHTREIMEL, KEEPING WITH IRREPROACHABLE FRUMKEIT ALL THE TRADITIONAL MINHAGIM AND HIDURIM (STRINGENCIES) IN THE WORLD OF CHASSIDUS PIETY OF MY GENERATION

4. Even though I could be having bittachon also in the basar. If any other person thinks he has grounds to have bittachon in the basar, I have more (II Cor.11:18-12:10):   *

5. bris milah on the eighth day [Luke 1:59; 2:21],  *from Bnei Yisroel by birth,  *of the tribe of Benjamin,  *a speaker of Lashon HaKodesh, Ivrit of Ivrit-speaking parents; a Hebrew of Hebrews (II Cor.11:22),  *with regard to the Torah, from the kat haPerushim (Act 23:6; 26:5), *

6. with regard to kanous (zealousness), persecuting the adat haMoshiach (Act 8:3; 22:4; 26:9-11),  *with regard to [my own, eigene] Tzidkat haTorah [3:9; Rom.2:27-29], unreproachable [glatt kosher frum and shomer mitzvot].   ALTHOUGH SHA'UL IS STILL LOYAL TO HIS PEOPLE AND IS STILL A  PRACTICING (SHOMER MITZVOT) JEW WHO IS PROUD OF HIS HERITAGE, YET THE PRAISE OF THE MEN OF JUDAH HE CONSIDERS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE PRAISE OF HASHEM; THE RABBI WHO ONCE KNEW THE ADULATION OF THE YESHIVAH AND PRAISE OF THE COURT OF THE KOHEN GADOL, CONSIDERS ALL THIS NOW AS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE DEVEKUT WITH HASHEM HE NOW KNOWS AND THE DA'AS OF THE TZIDKAT HASHEM THAT COMES NOT FROM YICHUS OR ZCHUS OF MA'ASEI MITZVOT (ROM.4:4-6; GAL.5:6; EPH.2:8-9) OR A LEGALISTIC MISINTERPRETATION OF THE TORAH BUT FROM THE TORAH-TRUE EMUNAH OF AVRAHAM AVINU IN REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH (BERESHIS 15:6); NOW SHA'UL IS SHOMER MITZOT OUT OF HIS JEWISH LOYALTY TO THE COVENANT OF THE TORAH AND NOT AS A MEANS TO EARN HIS OWN PERSONAL REDEMPTION APART FROM THE GEULAH SHLEIMAH PURCHASED FOR HIM BY REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH

7. But what things were revach (gain, profit, toeles) to me, these things I considered loss, on account of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach (Mt. 13:44-46; Luk.14:33).

8. But even more so, I consider all to be loss on account of the excellency of the da'as of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua Adoneinu [3:10; Yirmeyah 9:23-24], on account of whom all things I suffered loss and I consider them as nothing, in comparison, that I may gain Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach [Tehillim 73:25],

9. and be found in him, not having my own Tzedek (self-achieved righteousness, a self-righteousness) based on chumra (legalism [a misinterpretation of the Torah]), but the Tzedek [Yirmeyah 33:16] through emunah [Rom.3:21-22] in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, the Tzidkat Hashem based upon emunah [Bereshis 15:6; Rom.9:30].

10. I want to have da'as of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and of the gevurah (power) of his Techiyas haMesim and the devekut (attachment to G-d) of Moshiach's innuyim (sufferings -- 1:29;Rom.8:17; Gal.6:17), being formed into the mode of being of Moshiach's death [death to the sinful Olam Hazeh and the unregenerate basar--Rom.6:3-5],

11. if somehow I may oiftu (attain) to the Techiyas Hamesim [Act 4:2; Rev.20:5-6].   PRESSING TOWARD THE MARK OF KEDUSHA AND ALIYAH TO GAN EDEN IN REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH

12. Not that already I oispoyel (achieved, obtained) or already have been made shleimut, but I pursue this tochnit (master plan) that I may lay hold of [I Tim.6:12,19 cf.Php 2:6] that for which I was laid hold of by Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua [Act 9:5-6].

13. Achim b'Moshiach, I do not consider myself to have laid hold (3:12); but one zach (thing) I do, forgetting the things behind, and stretching forward to the things before,

14. according to the tachlis I pursue the prize of the Aliyah of Hashem, the k'riah (call) of HaShem b'Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua (II Pet.1:10; 2:12).

15. Therefore, as many as would be shlemut, let us think like this (2:5-8): and if in anything your makhshavot (thoughts) are different [Mt.5:48; I Cor.2:6], even this Hashem will reveal to you.

16. Fort (nevertheless), let us march in line with what we have attained, let us hold to the same [Gal.6:16].

17. Achim b'Moshiach, together be imitators of me [I Cor.4:16; 11:1]. Take note of the ones walking as you have a mofet (Zech 3:8) in us [2:5-8,19-30; I Thes.1:7; I Pet.5:3].

18. For many, of whom I was often telling you, and now also I say with weeping, walk as oyvim (enemies) of the Aitz [Devarim 21:23; 27:26; Gal.3:13; I Cor.1:23; Gal.6:12] of Moshiach [2:8].

19. Their destined end [Tehillim 73:17] is churban (destruction, Gehinnom). Their g-d is their appetite [Rom.16:18], and their kavod, what they glory in, is their bushah (shame). Their makhshavot are set on the Olam Hazeh [Rom.8:5-6].  WE ARE BNEI AVRAHAM BY EMUNAH AND OUR TORAT HAEZRAKHUT (CITIZENSHIP) IS OF THE OLAM HABAH, NOT THE OLAM HAZEH

20. But the torat haEzrakhut (citizenship--see 1:27) we practice exists in Shomayim [Eph.2:6; eb.12:22; Gal.4:26; 6:16], from where also we eagerly await a Moshi'a (Savior), a Go'el, Adoneinu Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua,

21. who will transfigure the guf (body) of our humiliation into the demut of the mode of being of the guf (body) of his kavod, according to the pe'ulah (action--1:6; 2:13) of his ko'ach power) [Rom.8:29; I Cor.15:43-53], even to the subjecting of all things to himself [I Cor. 15:28].

## Philippians 4

1. So then, my achim ahuvim whom I have a tshuka (longing) for, my simcha and atarah  (crown--I Thes 2:19-20), stand firm in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu.    THE SEFER CHAYYIM [SHEMOT 32:32,33; TEHILLIM 69:28; DAN.12:1; REV.3:5; 13:8; 17:8; 20:12,15; 21:27]

2. I appeal to Euodias and I appeal to Syntyche, think the same thing in Adoneinu.

3. Ken, I ask also you, true yoke-fellow, assist them, who contended alongside me in the Besuras HaGeulah with both Clement and the rest of the fellow po'alim (workers) of mine, whose names are in the Sefer haChayyim.   HAVE SIMCHA IN REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH ADONEINU; THE BIAS HAMOSHIACH IS IMMINENT

4. Have simcha in Adoneinu always [2:18; 3:1; Tehillim 85:6; 97:12; Chabakuk 3:18]; again I will say it.  Rejoice!

5. Let your chassidus sobriety be known to kol Bnei Adam; Rebbe, Moshiach Adoneinu is near [Tehillim 119:151; 145:18; Heb.10:37; Jas.5:8,9]!

6. Be anxious in nothing [Mt.6:25; I Pet.5:7], but in everything by tefillah and by techinah (supplication) with hodayah (thanksgiving--Col.4:2), let your requests be made known before Hashem,

7. and the shalom Hashem [Yeshayah 26:3; Joh.14:27; Col.3:15], surpassing all binah (understanding) will guard your levavot and your makhshavot (thoughts) in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua. 
 THE HITBONANUT IN LINE WITH DEVEKUT; WHAT YOU ARE TO TRACHT (CONTEMPLATE) WHEN YOUR ARE FARTRACHT (INTROSPECTIVE); LET THIS BE YOUR HITBODEDUT (QUIET MEDITATION)

8. As to the rest, Achim b'Moshiach, whatever things are Emes, Nichbad, Yashar, Tahor, male No'am and tiferet (Shemot 28:2), whatever things are commendable, if there is any virtue, if any praise, think about these things.

9. And that which you learned and you received and you heard and you saw in me, practice these [Rom.12:17] and Elohei haShalom [Rom.15:33; 16:20; I Cor.14:33; I Thes.5:23] will be with you.      TODAH RABBAH FOR YOUR MATANOT (GIFTS)

10. I had much simcha in Adoneinu that now at last you blossomed anew so as to think of me, for indeed you were thinking of me, but were lacking opportunity.

11. Not that I refer to lack, for I have learned, in whatever circumstances I am, to be tzufrieden (content) [I Tim.6:6].

12. I have da'as both to be humbled in anavah and I have da'as how to abound in everything. And in all things I have learned what is nistar (concealed), I have learned what it means to be filled and to have hunger, to  abound and to have lack.

13. I can do all things in the One empowering me [II Cor.12:10; II Tim.4:7].

14. Fort (nevertheless), you did well in entering into devekut (attachment to G-d) with me through sharing in my Messianic innuyim (sufferings).

15. And also you Philippians have da'as, that in the beginning of the Besuras HaGeulah, when I went out from Macedonia, not one kehillah shared with me in an accounting of expenditures and receipts except you only [II Cor.11:9].

16. Indeed in Thessalonica both once and again you sent to my need.

17. Not that I seek the matanah (gift), but I seek the p'ri increasing to your account [I Cor.9:11].

18. But I have all things and I abound;  I have been filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things from you, a RE'ACH HANNICHOACH ("a pleasant aroma" Bereshis 8:21), an acceptable, sacrifice well-pleasing to Hashem [Shemot 29:18; Yechezkel 20:41].   HASHEM RO'I LO EH'CH'SAR (TEHILLIM  23:1)

19. And my G-d will fill every need of yours [Tehillim 23:1] according to his osher (riches) in Kavod in Moshiach Yehoshua.

20.  L'Elohim Avinu hakavod l'Olemei Olamim. Omein.   FINAL "SHALOM" GREETINGS

21. Greet with "Shalom" every kadosh in Moshiach Yehoshua; the Achim b'Moshiach here with me send "Shalom" greetings.

22. All the kedoshim send "Shalom" greetings, especially the kedoshim in Caesar [Nero's] household [Php.1:13].

23. The Chen v'Chesed of Adoneinu Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua be with your neshamah.
