# 2 Thessalonians

## 2 Thessalonians 1

1. From Sha'ul and Silvanus (Sila) and Timotiyos. To the kehillah of the inhabitants of the city of Thessalonika in Hashem, in Elohim Avinu and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua Adoneinu,

2. Chen v'Chesed Hashem to you and Shalom from Elohim Avinu and Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua Adoneinu.  HODINU L'HASHEM FOR THE KEHILLAH'S GROWING EMUNAH AND AHAVAH IN FACE OF REDIFOT AND TZOROS

3. With continuous todot we ought to make berachot to Hashem concerning you, Achim b'Moshiach, as is fitting, because your emunah is increasing abundantly and the ahavah (agape) every one of you has for the other is growing.

4. Therefore, we ourselves glory in you in all the kehillot of Hashem for your zitzfleisch (patience) and emunah in all the redifot (persecutions) and the tzoros you are enduring,

5. kluhr a manifest siman (sign) of the yashar mishpat (righteous judgment) of Hashem intended for you to be deemed worthy of the Malchut Hashem, on behalf of which also you undergo [Chevlei Moshiach] sufferings.  ON THE RETRIBUTION OF REDEFOT AND THE REWARD OF MA'AMINIM AT THE BIAS MOSHIACH, AT HIS PAROUSIA, HIS ARRIVAL

6. Indeed it is emes and tzedek for Hashem to repay with tzarah (tribulation) those who bring tzarah (tribulation) on you

7. and to recompense you, the ones suffering tzarah (tribulation), with revachah (relief) along with us at the Apocalypse of [Moshiach] Yehoshua Adoneinu from Shomayim with the malachim of his oz (power)

8. BELAHAVEI AISH ("in flaming fire" YESHAYAH 66:15), giving Onesh to the ones not knowing Hashem and to the ones not obeying the Besuras HaGeulah of [Moshiach] Yehoshua Adoneinu.

9. These are the ones who will pay an Onesh of Avaddon Olam (Eternal Destruction [Gehinnom]) away from the Shechinah of Hashem UMEHADAR GE'ONO ("and from the splendor of his majesty"  --YESHAYAH 2:19),

10. when He comes to be glorified in His kedoshim and to be marveled at in all the ma'aminim [in Moshiach] because our martyr's witness to you was believed in YOM HAHU ("that Day" YESHAYAH 2:11).

11. To this end also we make tefillos always concerning you that Eloheynu may count you worthy of the Keri'ah (Calling) and by His gevurah may fulfill every chefetz hatov (good desire) and ma'aseh haEmunah (work of Faith)

12. al menat (in order that) ha-Shem (the Name) of Adoneinu Yehoshua may be glorified in you, and you, in him [Moshiach], according to the unmerited Chen v'Chesed of Eloheynu and Moshiach Yehoshua Adoneinu.

## 2 Thessalonians 2

1. We ask you, Achim b'Moshiach, concerning the Bias Moshiach (the Arrival/Coming of Moshiach) Yehoshua Adoneinu and our being gathered together to him [Moshiach],

2. that you not become too hastily disturbed from your mental composure nor frightened either by a ruach or by a dibbur (saying) or by a iggeret (letter), as if from us, saying that the YOM Hashem (AMOS 5:18) has come.

3. Let no one in any way lead you astray, because, unless the Mered (Rebellion), the [Anti-Moshiach] Shmad, the Ma'al Defection, the Azivah Desertion, comes rishonah (first), and the Apocalypse of the Ish haMufkarut (Man of Lawlessness), the Ish haChatta'ah Ben haAvaddon (Man of Sin, Son of Destruction) is unveiled...

4. I'm referring to the one setting himself against and exalting himself AL KOL EL (DANIEL 11:36), above all that are given the appellation "El" or "avodat Hashem," with the result that he sits down in G-d's own Beis Hamikdash, proclaiming that he himself is Elohim (YECHEZKEL 28:2)...

5. Do you not recall that when I was still with you I was telling you these things?

6. Yet you know what is restraining now, so that he [Anti-Moshiach] may be unveiled and revealed in his own time.

7. For the sod haMufkarut (mystery of lawlessness) is already working; only he who restrains just now will do so until he is taken out of the way.

8. And then the Ish haMufkarut, the Lawless One, will be revealed, whom HaAdon [Yehoshua] will destroy by the RUACH (YESHAYAH 11:4) of His mouth and will wipe out at the epiphany of his Bias (Parousia).

9. The Bias of the Anti-Moshiach is according to the working of Hasatan with all false koach and otot and pseudo-moftim,

10. and with all deception of resha (wickedness) for those who are perishing, because they did not accept the ahavat haEmes so that they be delivered.

11.  And for this reason Hashem sends to them a powerful madduchei shav (delusion) al menat (in order that) they believe what is sheker.

12.  This is for the purpose of condemning to Onesh all the ones who have no emunah in haEmes, but instead have had delight in resha.  THE BECHIRAH OF THE BIKKURIM FOR THE GEULAH AND THE FAITHFUL SHOMRIM OF MOSHIACH'S TORAH

13.  But we ought always to offer todot and make berachot to Hashem concerning you, Achim b'Moshiach ahuvei Hashem, because Hashem chose you as bikkurim for the Geulah through kedusha of the Ruach HaKodesh and emunah in haEmes.

14. This is haEmes to which Hashem called you through our Besuras HaGeulah to the obtaining of the kavod of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua.

15. So then, Achim b'Moshiach, stand fast and hold fast to the [orthodox Jewish] emunah, the Moshiach's torah that was handed over and transmitted to you, which you were taught whether by dibbur (saying) or by our iggeret.

16. Now may haMelech haMoshiach Yehoshua Adoneinu Himself and Elohim Avinu, who has regarded us with ahavah (agape), and has granted us nechamat olam (eternal encouragement) and tikvah tovah (good hope) by the unmerited Chesed of Hashem--

17. May He give chozek (strength) and encouragement to you in every mitzvah (good deed) you do and in every dibbur (saying) you utter.

## 2 Thessalonians 3

1. Lemaskana (finally), Achim b'Moshiach, daven tefillos for us, that the Dvar Hashem  will run and be lifted up in kavod, just as it is also with you,

2. and that we may be delivered from wicked anshei resha, for not all possess the emunah.

3. But Ne'eman is Hashem who gives you chozek (strength) and is shomer over you, guarding you from the Evil One.

4. And we have bittachon in Hashem concerning you, that you are doing and will continue to do what we have directed.

5.  Now may Hashem direct your levavot in the ahavat Hashem and into the zitzfleisch of Moshiach.   ADMONITION AGAINST SCHNORRERS IN THE KEHILLAH

6. Now we charge you, Achim b'Moshiach, b'Shem Adoneinu Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, to shun association with every one of the Achim b'Moshiach who follows the derech habatlanim (way of idlers) and walks not according to Moshiach's torah that was handed over and transmitted to you and which you received from us.

7. For you yourselves know how it is necessary to imitate us as a mofet, a role model, because we were not batlanim among you.

8. Nor did we eat lechem (food) from anyone gratis, but in labor and exertion lailah v'yomah we were working for the tachlis of not weighing down any one of you;

9. not because we do not have the zechut (right), but in order that we impart ourselves as a mofet (role model) to you that you might imitate us.

10. For even when we were with you, this we used to direct you: that if anyone will not be a melachah (worker), neither let him be an ochel (eater).

11. For we hear that some among you are leading the life of a batlan (loafer), not being busy with a parnasah, but being busybodies with hitarevut (meddlesomeness).

12.  Now such persons we are directing and exhort in Moshiach Yehoshua Adoneinu to work with quietness that they may eat their own lechem.

13. But you, Achim b'Moshiach, do not lose chozek in well-doing.

14. But if anyone does not obey the gzeira (injunction) in this iggeret (letter), take special notice of that one; do not associate with him, for the purpose of stirring him with a sense of bushah (shame).

15.  And do not consider (him) an an oyev (enemy) but warn him as an ach b'Moshiach. FINAL TEFILLAH

16. Now may Elohei haShalom Himself grant you shalom in every way. Hashem be with you all.

17. I, Sha'ul, send dirshu bishalom  in my own handwriting, which is the distinctive siman (sign) in every iggeret; this is the way I write.

18.  The unmerited Chen v'Chesed Hashem of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua be with you all.
