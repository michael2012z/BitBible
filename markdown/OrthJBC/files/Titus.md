# Titus

## Titus 1

1. Sha'ul an eved of Hashem and a Shliach of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, according to the charedi (orthodox) emunah (faith) of the Bechirei Hashem (chosen ones of G-d) and da'as haEmes as pertains to chassidus [in Moshiach],

2. based on a tikvah of Chayyei Olam which Hashem--who cannot speak sheker [Bamidbar 24:19; Shmuel Alef 15:29]--promised before the Yamim haOlam (days of eternity),

3. but revealed at the proper time his dvar [Besuras HaGeulah] in the hachrazah (proclamation, kyrygma), with which I was entrusted, according to the mitzva of Hashem Moshieynu.

4. To Titos, beni ha'amitti baEmunah (my true son in the faith), the [orthodox Jewish] emunah shared in common.  Chesed Hashem and Shalom from Elohim HaAv and Moshiach Yehoshua Moshieynu.  MESSIANIC S'MICHAH FOR MOSHIACH'S ZEKENIM IN THE KEHILLOT OF MOSHIACH

5. For this reason I left you in Crete that you should set in order what remains and give messianic s'michah to Zekenim (Shemot 12:21) city by city, as I directed you.

6. If anyone is without reproach, a ba'al isha echat (husband of one wife), his banim being ma'aminim in Moshiach, and not under accusation of debauchery and zenut or sorrut (rebelliousness/insubordination) [Shmuel Alef 2:22].

7. For it is necessary for the congregational Mashgiach Ruchani to be without reproach as Hashem's mefakke'ach al Bais Hashem (steward or supervisor of the House of G-d), not a ba'al gaavah (a haughty person), not quick in ka'as (anger), not a shikkor (drunkard) given to much wine, not violent, not a gelt-loving kamtzon (miser).

8. Rather, the Mashgiach Ruchani must be a man who practices hachnosas orchim (hospitality), an ohev es haTov (a lover of the good), having seychel, a tzaddik, kadosh (holy), kovesh es yitzro (self-controlled),

9. devoted to the faithful hattafah (preaching) of the Besuras HaGeulah, adequate for hora'ah (teaching) that exhorts to [Moshiach's] orthodox Jewish doctrine and for refuting and exposing with conviction the ones speaking against it.

10. For there are indeed many mitnaggedim, idle talkers and deceivers, especially the ones of the party of the Mohalim haGoyim (Circumcisers of Gentiles),

11. whose mouths it is necessary to stop, who are subverting entire mishpachot (families) by teaching what they ought not, for the sake of dishonest gelt.

12. A certain one of them, a "navi" of their own number, said, "Cretans are always meshakkrim (liars), wicked beasts, lazy trombeniks."

13. This edut is true, for which cause rebuke them sharply, that they may be orthodox Jewish in [Moshiach's] emunah,

14. not paying attention to Jewish aggadot and to mitzvot d'Rabbanan (precepts imposed by the rabbis), becoming meshummad (apostate) from haEmes.

15. All things are tahor to the tahorim; but, to the ones having been defiled and taking the side of the Apikoros, nothing is tahor, but has been made tameh, both lev and matzpun.

16. Hashem they profess to know, but by their ma'asim they deny him, being disqualified [for the rabbanut or ministry of Moshiach] and sorrut, and, as to every one of the ma'asim tovim, unpalatably unkosher (unfit).

## Titus 2

1. But you, speak the things which are suitable to Moshiach's orthodox Jewish doctrine.

2. Zekenim need to be temperate, respectable, men of seychel, being orthodox [in Moshiach] in the emunah, in ahavah, in savlanut

3. Similarly the senior women, the zekanot, in hitnahagut (conduct) as befits kedushah, not yentas of slander nor slaves of wine, but melamedot es haTov (teachers of the Good)

4. that they may encourage the young nashim to have ahavah for their ba'alim and their banim,

5. to have seychel, tahor in tznius, domestic workers baBayit, tov lev, being submissive to their ba'alim, lest chillul Hashem come to the dvar haElohim.

6. The bochrim, similarly, exhort to have seychel

7. about all things, showing yourself a mofet of ma'asim tovim.  In the hora'ah [of Moshiach], show integrity, seriousness,

8. along with dibur (speech) that is orthodox [in Moshiach] and beyond reproach, that the mitnagged may be ashamed, having no lashon hora to say against you.

9. Avadim (slaves) need to be submissive to their own adonim in everything, to be acceptable, not talking back,

10. not pilfering, but showing all good reliability, that they may adorn the hora'ah of Hashem Moshieynu in all things.

11. For the Chen v'chesed of Hashem has appeared, bringing Yeshu'at Eloheynu to kol bnei Adam,

12. instructing us to deny all that is frai and not chassidus [in Moshiach] and all that is ta'avanut, and to live with seychel and tzedek Hashem and yirat Shamayim in Olam Hazeh,

13. awaiting the tikvah hameashsheret, the appearing of the kavod haEloheinu haGadol and Moshieynu Yehoshua the Moshiach,

14. who gave his nefesh on behalf of us, that he might bring in the Geulah for us, redeeming us MI KOL AVONOTAV (TEHILLIM 130:8), making tahor AM LI SEGULAH ("A PEOPLE FOR MY POSSESSION" --SHEMOT 19:5), zealous for ma'asim tovim.

15. Preach these things, give chizak and reprove with all authority.  Let no one "write you off."

## Titus 3

1. Remind them to be "V'NISHMA" ("OBEDIENT, "AND WE WILL OBEY!"--SHEMOT 24:7) to sarim (rulers), to shiltonim (authorities), to be submissive, to be obedient, ready for every ma'aseh tov.

2. Speak lashon hora of no one, be not ohev riv (quarrelsome). Be eidel (gentle), displaying anvetanut (meekness) to kol bnei Adam.

3. For all of us were once chaser da'at (lacking knowledge), sorrarim (disobedient), being led astray, avadim (slaves) of ta'avot and to various pleasures of Olam Hazeh, spending our lives in eyvah (enmity--Bereshis 3:15) and kina (jealousy), hated, and hating one another.

4. But when the Chen v'chesed and the ahavah of Hashem Moshieynu appeared to bnei Adam,

5. not by ma'asim mitzvot in yechus which we have merited, but according to his rachamim, he granted us Yeshu'at Eloheynu through the mikveh mayim ruchani of rebirth and renewing of the Ruach Hakodesh,

6. which he poured out on us richly through Moshiach Yehoshua Moshieynu,

7.  that, having been acquitted betzedek by the chesed of Hashem, we might become yoreshim (heirs) in the tikvah HaChayei HaOlam.

8. Trustworthy is the dvar Emes. I counsel you to strongly affirm the divrei torah I am handing on to you, that those who have become ma'aminim in Hashem may be shomer for ma'asim tovim. These things to bnei Adam are good, tov m'od.

9. But pilpul minutiae controversies and toledot and quarrels and fights about the Torah, avoid, for they are unprofitable hevel.

10. An ish hacholek (a man of division, a divisive man) after one or two warnings, avoid,

11. knowing that such a man is perverted and sinful, bringing harsha'ah (condemnation) upon himself.

12. When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, try to come to me at Nicopolis, for there I have decided to spend the winter.

13. Do your utmost to speed Zenas the Torah moreh and Apollos on their way, that nothing for them may be lacking.

14. Let anshei adateynu (the men of our community) learn to be concerned about ma'asim tovim so as to supply urgent needs, that they may not be lo poreh (unfruitful).   A FINAL SHALOM

15. All the ones with me give you "shalom" greetings.  "Shalom" to those who have ahavah for us in the emunah [of Moshiach].  Chen v'chesed Hashem to all of you.
