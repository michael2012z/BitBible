# 1 Peter

## 1 Peter 1

1. Shimon Kefa a Shliach of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua  to haBechirim (the Chosen ones [2:4,6,9]), to the Exiled ones of the Golus, Sojourners living as aliens in the Diaspora, scattered in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,

2.  to haBechirim (the Chosen ones) according to the foreknowledge [1:20] of Elohim Avinu, the ones set apart as kedoshim by the Ruach Hakodesh, resulting in mishma'at (obedience [1:14,22; 3:6; 4:17]) to the Moshiach and resulting in hazzayat haDam haMoshiach (sprinkling of the Blood of Moshiach--Yeshayah 52:15, Shemot 24:7), of Moshiach Yehoshua.  May Chesed Hashem and Shalom Hashem abound to all of you!  A BERACHAH FOR THE NEW BIRTH IN MOSHIACH

3. Baruch Hashem, haElohim Avi of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua!  By his great rachamim (mercy) we have been born anew to a tikvah chayah (living hope) through Moshiach Yehoshua's Techiyas (Resurrection) from Hamesim (the dead ones).

4. We have also been born anew to a nachalah (inheritance [3:9]) that is without shachat (corruption--Tehillim 16:10) and undefiled and unfading, having been preserved in Shomayim for you,

5. the ones by the koach of Hashem being guarded through Emunah (Faith) for Yeshu'at Eloheynu (the Salvation of our G-d), which is ready to be revealed at the Ketz Hayamim (End of Days).

6. In this you have great simcha, though now for a little while you may have to suffer in various massot (trials/temptations [4:12]),

7. that the genuineness of your Emunah, much more valuable than gold which, though perishable is tested by Aish (Fire), may be found to the tehillah and the kavod and the teferet at the Apocalypse of Moshiach Yehoshua.   REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH THE HIDDEN TZADDIK

8. He is the one for whom you have ahavah, even though you have not seen him. Though you do not now see him, you have emunah in him [as Moshiach] and rejoice with simcha inexpressible and full of kavod,

9. obtaining the maskana (outcome, toitzaa) of your Emunah, the Yeshu'at Eloheynu of your nefashot (souls).    THE NEVU'OT OF THE NEVI'IM AND THE MA'AMINIM IN MOSHIACH

10. The Nevi'im, who prophecied of the Chen v'Chesed Hashem that was to come to you, searched and inquired about this Yeshua'at Eloheynu.

11. The Nevi'im were searching for what time or what context of occasion the Ruach of Moshiach in them was pointing to, when predicting the Chevlei Moshiach and haKavod to follow.

12. The revelation came to the Nevi'im that the avodas hakodesh they were rendering was not to themselves, but to you, when they spoke of the things announced to you through the Maggidim of the Besuras HaGeulah by the Ruach Hakodesh sent from Shomayim, the very things even malachim desire to look into.   KEDOSHIM TIH'YU KI KADOSH ANI

13. Therefore, tighten the "readiness" belt of your mind, a mind that is kovesh es yitzro (self-controlled).  Set your tikvah completely on the Chen v'Chesed Hashem that is being brought to you at the Apocalypse of Moshiach Yehoshua.

14. As Bnei Mishma'at (Children of Obedience--1:2), not conforming yourselves to your former ta'avot, when you lacked da'as (personal, saving knowledge),

15. but, als (since) the One who bestows on you the keri'ah (calling) is KADOSH HU (TEHILLIM 99:5), so also yourselves become kedoshim in hitnahagut (conduct),

16. because it says in the Torah, KEDOSHIM TIH'YU  KI KADOSH ANI ("YOU MUST BE HOLY ONES FOR I AM HOLY"--VAYIKRA 19:2). 
 MOSHIACH THE TRUE KORBAN PESACH OF THE GEULAH

17. And if you call upon as "Avinu" [Mt.6:9] the One who is the impartial Shofet (Shofet kol ha'aretz) of each man L'ISH K'MA'ASEIHU ("TO EACH AS HIS DEEDS"--TEHILLIM 62:13), then conduct yourself with yirat Shomayim during your time in the Golus of Olam Hazeh,

18. knowing that the padut nafsheynu (redemption of our souls) was not with perishable things such as silver or gold when your Geulah (Redemption) was purchased from the Derech haHevel handed down to you from your Avot.

19. No, it was the precious DAM (VAYIKRA 17:11) as of a SEH TAMIM U'MUM ("lamb unblemished and unspotted" --SHEMOT 12:5; VAYIKRA 22:20; YESHAYAH 53:7-9), the DAM of Moshiach (Mt.26:28)

20. who, on the one hand, having been foreknown lifnei hivvased tevel (before the foundation of the world), but, on the other hand, having been manifested [5:4] at the Ketz Hayamim (End of Days) because of you.

21. Through him [Moshiach] you have emunah in Hashem, the One who brought forth Moshiach's Techiyas (Resurrection) from Hamesim (the dead ones) and gave him Kavod.  And so your emunah and your tikvah [1:13] are in Hashem.

22. Having purified your nefashot (souls) by mishma'at (obedience--1:2) to haEmes, resulting in ahavah shel achvah (brotherly love) without tzevi'ut (hypocrisy), have fervent ahavah (agap‚) for one another, from a lev tahor.
 NEW BIRTH IN MOSHIACH WHO IS THE DVAR ELOHEYNU YAKUM L'OLAM

23.  You have been given a new birth, not from perishable zerah (seed), but zerah that is without shachat (corruption--Tehillim 16:10), through the Dvar Elohim who is Chai v'Nitzav l'Olam (living and remaining firm forever).

24. For, KOL HABASAR CHATZIR V'CHOL CHASEDO K'TZITZ  HASSADEH, YAVESH CHATZIR, NAVEL TZITZ  UDVAR ELOHEYNU YAKUM L'OLAM ("All flesh is grass and all of [mankind's] glory is like the flower: the grass withers, the flower falls,

25. but the Word of our G-d stands forever" YESHAYAH 40:6-8).  And this is the Dvar proclaimed to you as Besura HaGeulah [in Moshiach].

## 1 Peter 2

1. Therefore, having put away all rishus (malice), all  remiyah (guile, fraud, deceit) and tzevi'ut (hypocrisy) and kin'ah (envy) and all lashon hora,

2. as new born olalim (infants), desire the pure cholov ruchani (spiritual milk), that by it you may grow into Yeshu'at Eloheynu,

3. now that you have tasted  KI TOV Hashem ("that the L-rd is good," TEHILLIM 34:9).

4. Come to him [Moshiach], to that "Even Chayah" ("Living Stone"), CHADAL ISHIM ("rejected by men"--YESHAYAH 53:3; TEHILLIM 118:22; YESHAYAH 28:16) but with Hashem BECHIR ("Chosen" YESHAYAH 42:1 [1:1]),  precious--

5. You also, like avanim chayot (living stones [2:24]), are being built up for a Bayit Ruchani for a kehunnat kodesh (holy priesthood) to offer up zivchei ruach (sacrifices of the spirit) acceptable to Hashem through Moshiach Yehoshua.

6. For it stands written in the Kitvei haKodesh, HINENI YISSAD B'TZION EVEN PINNAT YIKRAT ("Behold! I place in Zion a precious corner stone"--YESHAYAH 28:16; TEHILLIM 118:22; DANIEL 2:34-35), chosen, and HAMA'AMIN LO YACHISH ("the one believing (on him, on Moshiach) never will be dismayed/ashamed--YESHAYAH 28:16).  WHY SOME, WHEN IT COMES TO REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH, BECOME MESHUMMAD (APOSTATE)

7. Therefore, to you who are the ma'aminim [in Moshiach] this EVEN ("Stone") is YIKRAT ("precious"--YESHAYAH 28:16), but to the apikursim (unbelievers): EVEN MA'ASU HABONIM HAY'TAH LEROSH PINAH ("The stone which the ones building rejected became the head of the corner"--TEHILLIM 118:22 [YESHAYAH 53:3]).

8. And EVEN NEGEF UL'TZUR MICHSHOL ("a stone for stumbling over and a rock for falling over"--YESHAYAH 8:14).  They stumble because they have no mishma'at (obedience--1:2,14,22; 4:17) to the Dvar Hashem--which is also what they were appointed for [II Pet.2:9,12,17; Jude 1:4; Rom.9:14-24]. MOSHE RABBEINU AND YESHAYAH SPOKE ABOUT YOU MA'AMINIM IN MOSHIACH

9. but you are an AM NIVCHAR ("a chosen people"--YESHAYAH 43:20; SHEMOT 6:7), a MAMLECHET KOHANIM  ("a kingdom of priests/royal priests"--SHEMOT 19:6), a GOY KADOSH ("a holy nation"--SHEMOT 19:6), an AM SEGULLAH ("a people of treasured possession"--SHEMOT 19:5; MALACHI 3:17), for this purpose: that you may declare the wondrous deeds of the One who gave you the keri'ah (calling) and summoned you out of choshech into his marvelous ohr [YESHAYAH 43:21; 42:12].

10. You, who once were LO AMMI ("not my people"-HOSHEA 1:9) but now are AMMI ATAH ("my people you are"--HOSHEA 2:25), the AM Hashem ("the people of G-d"), the ones having not received rachamim, but now having received rachamim (HOSHEA 2:25).
 CHIZZUK TO THOSE WHO ARE EXILES IN THE GOLUS OF OLAM HAZEH

11. Chaverim, I salute you as aliens and exiles (1:1,17) with the "chazak ve'ematz" ("Be strong and of good courage"), exhorting you to abstain from fleshly ta'avot which war against the neshamah.

12. Let your hitnahagut (conduct) among the Goyim show feste (excellent) midas chassidus (quality of piety) that, wherein they speak against you as anshei resha (men of wickedness), by observing your ma'asim tovim they may glorify Hashem in the YOM PEKUDDAH ("Day of Visitation" [YESHAYAH 10:3]).

13. Submit [2:18; 3:1] to every created human memshalet (governing authority) because of Hashem, whether to a melech (king) as being haRosh,

14. or to moshelim (governors) as being sent by Hashem for the purpose of nakam (vengeance) on anshei resha (men of wickedness) but for the purpose of shevach (praise, commendation) on anshei tzedek.

15. For it is the ratzon Hashem (the will of G-d) that you, by acting as anshei tzedek, may silence the lack of da'as (knowledge) of the kesilim (the foolish people).

16. As Avadim (Servants) of Hashem, live as bnei Chorim (sons of Freedom, freemen); yet do not use your cherut (freedom) as a cloak for concealing ra'ah (evil).

17. Allot kavod (respect, honor) to kol Adam (all Men); have ahavah (agap‚) for [Moshiach's] agudah (brotherhood); allot yirat Shomayim to Hashem [1:17; 2:17; 3:2,6,14,16], allot kavod to haMelech.

18. Avadim, be submitting in kol yir'ah (all fear) to your adonim (masters), not only to the good and eidele (gentle) adonim, but also to the hard sarei misim (task-masters).

19. For this is worthy of shevach (praise, commendation) if, because of a consciousness of Hashem, anyone bears up under tzoros (troubles) while suffering unjustly.

20. For what shevach (praise) is it if, after committing cha'ttaim (sins) and being beaten, you endure?  But if being osei tzedek (doers of rightness) and suffering, then you endure, this is worthy of shevach before Hashem.  BACHAVURAH (IN COMPANY OF) THE CHABBUROT (WOUNDS) OF MOSHIACH

21. It was for this purpose [of your being osei tzedek and suffering] that you were given your keri'ah (calling), because also Moshiach suffered on behalf of you [YESHAYAH 53:5-6], leaving you a mofet (example), that you should follow in the steps of Moshiach,

22. who was beli chet (without sin) V'LO MIRMAH BEFIV ("and no deceit was in his mouth"--YESHAYAH 53:9);

23. Moshiach, who, being reviled, did not retaliate; suffering, he did not utter iyumim (threats), but handed himself over, entrusting himself to the Shofet Tzadik (Righteous Judge [4:5]);

24. Moshiach, who himself NASAH ES CHATTOTEYNU ("bore our sins" YESHAYAH 53:5,8,12) in his basar [TEHILLIM 16:9-10; 22:1-32] on the Aitz [haChayim, the Tree of Life--BERESHIT 3:22] that, having become niftarim (deceased ones) to chattoteynu, we might become Kol Chai (all living) to Tzidkanut (Righteousness); UVACHAVURATO NIRPA LANU ("by whose wound you were healed"--YESHAYAH 53:5).

25. For you were KULANU KATZON TA'INU ("all of us like sheep we went astray"--YESHAYAH 53:6), for you were as sheep being led astray, but you made teshuva now to the Ro'eh [YECHEZKEL 34:1-16] and Mashgiach (Overseer--IYOV 10:12) of your nefashot (souls).

## 1 Peter 3

1. Nashim (wives), submit similarly to your own ba'alim (husbands), that even if any anashim lack mishma'at (obedience) to the Dvar Hashem [of the Besuras HaGeulah--1:25], through the hitnahagut (conduct) of their nashim they may be won without the dvar,

2. when they see your yirat Shomayim and your midas chassidus (quality of piety).  WINNING BA'ALIM TO MOSHIACH AND THE MATTER OF TZNIUS

3. Do not let your adornment be outward: with coiffures and with wearing gold or fine apparel,

4. but let your adornment be hidden:  adornment shebalev (inwardly) by the imperishable [1:4] adorning of the quiet ruach anavah (humble spirit), which is before Hashem of great worth.

5. For so formerly also the nashim hakedoshot (holy women) whose tikvah was in Hashem were adorning themselves, submitting themselves to their own ba'alim.

6. Just so, Sarah submitted in mishma'at (obedience) to Avraham Avinu, calling him ADONI [BERESHIS 18:12].  You became her banot (daughters), acting as nashei tzedek [2:15] and not fearing any intimidation [Mishle 3:25].  BA'ALIM AND THEIR NASHIM AS YORESHIM TOGETHER

7. Likewise, Ba'alim (Husbands), dwell with them according to the da'as of the isha as a k'li rach (weaker vessel), showing them kavod as also being yoreshim together [3:9] of the mattanah (gift) of the Chen v'Chesed haChayim, so that your tefillos will not be hindered [3:12; 4:7].  SUMMING UP: SHALOM BAYIS OF MOSHIACH IN THE KEHILLAH DURING THE COMING TIME OF TZOROS

8. Now, to say over, all of you be an agudah (union) in your thinking, have achdus, be sympathetic, having ahavah (agap‚) for the achim [Tehillim 133:1], being anshei rachamim, sh'fal ruach (lowly of spirit),

9. not rendering ra'ah for ra'ah or lashon hora for lashon hora, but, fahkert (on the contrary), rendering a berachah (blessing), because to this purpose you were given your keri'ah (calling), that you may inherit a berachah (blessing).

10. HAISH HECHAFETZ CHAYYIM OHEV YAMIM LIROT TOV ("For the one wanting to love life and to see good days") NETZOR L'SHONCHA MEYRAH USFATECHA MIDABEIR MIRMAH ("Let him stop his tongue from speaking lashon hora and his lips from speaking remiyah [guile, fraud, deceit]--TEHILLIM 34:13f)."

11. SUR MEYRAH VA'ASEIR TOV BAKESH SHALOM V'RADEFEHU ("Let him turn away from resha and let him do that which is good, let him seek shalom and pursue it");

12. EINEI Hashem EL TZADDIKIM V'AZNAV EL SHAV'ATAM ("Because the tzaddikim are before the eyes of Hashem and His ears are open to their tefillos"--TEHILLIM 34:15-16).  P'NEI Hashem B'OSEI RAH L'HACHRIT MEYA'RETZ ZICHRAM ("But the face of the L-rd is against the ones doing evil to cut off their memory from the earth"--TEHILLIM 34:15-17).

13. And who is the one harming you if you become Kannaim haTov (Zealots of the Good)?

14. But if indeed you should suffer tzoros because of the tzedek Hashem, you are ashrey (blessed,happy).  But do not fear their pachad (terror), neither be troubled.

15. But reverence in your levavot (hearts) Moshiach as Adoneinu, prepared always for an apologetic defense to everyone coming to you with a sh'eilah (question), ready with a word concerning the tikvah in you,

16. but with anavah (meekness) and yirat Shomayim, having a matzpun tahor (clean conscience [3:21]), so that, when you are maligned by lashon hora, your abusers may be humiliated by your midas chassidus (quality of piety) in Moshiach. ON TESHUVAH AND EMUNAH IN MOSHIACH OUR MEMALLE MAKOM (SUBSTITUTE) AND ON MOSHIACH'S TEVILAH IN THE MIKVEH MAYIM, WHICH IS A PLEDGE FOR A MATZPUN TAHOR AND WHICH WAS PREFIGURED BY THE MABBUL (FLOOD) WHEN MOSHIACH WENT TO THE RUCHOT IN MISHMAR

17. For if such is the ratzon Hashem, it is better to suffer tzoros for doing mitzvot than for doing ra'ah.

18. Because, indeed, Moshiach suffered once on behalf of chata'im (sins), a tzaddik (righteous one) on behalf of the chatta'im (unrighteous ones, sinners), that he might bring you to Hashem--he, having been, in the basar of Moshiach [Tehillim 16:9-10], put to death, yet, in the Ruach Hakodesh, having been made alive [4:6];

19. in which also to the ruchot (spirits) in mishmar (prison), having gone, Moshiach made the hachrazah (proclamation, kyrygma)

20. to ones without mishma'at (obedience) back then when the zitzfleisch (patience) of Hashem was waiting, in the days of Noach, while the Teva (Ark) was being prepared, in which a few, that is shemoneh nefashot (eight souls), were delivered through that mabbul's mikveh mayim;

21. and Moshiach's tevilah in the mikveh mayim, which this mabbul prefigures, now delivers you, not by means of the removal of filth from the basar, but by means of the hitchaiy'vut (pledge) of a matzpun tahor toward Hashem, through the Techiyas haMesim of Moshiach Yehoshua,

22. who is at the right hand of Hashem, having gone into Shomayim, with malachim and rashuyot (authorities) and gevurot under his feet.

## 1 Peter 4

1. Therefore, als (since) Moshiach underwent bodily sivlot (sufferings [4:13]), also you arm yourselves with the same way of thinking as Moshiach, because the one having suffered in the basar (flesh) has finished with chet (sin)

2. so as no longer to live the remaining time of Olam Hazeh in the basar, in the ta'avot bnei Adam (lusts of men), but in the ratzon Hashem (will of G-d).

3. For you have already spent sufficient time (time already gone by) in Olam Hazeh participating in the ta'avot of the Goyim, walking in darchei zimah (the ways of licentiousness), ta'avot, shichrut (drunkenness), orgiastic drinking mesibot (parties), and unlawful avodas elilim (idolatry).

4. The Goyim think it strange [4:12] that you are not running with them into the same mabbul (flood) of dissipation, and so they blaspheme and commit Chillul Hashem.

5. But they will give an account to the One being ready to take his seat as the Shofet (Judge) of the chayyim (the living ones) and the mesim (the dead ones).

6. For, indeed, this is the reason that the Besuras HaGeulah was preached to the mesim (dead ones), that, though judged in the basar as men [Heb.12:23; Joh 5:25; I Thes.4:13-18], they might have Chayyim in the ruach as Hashem. THE KETZ HAYAMIM HAS DRAWN NEAR

7. The Ketz (End) of all things now has drawn near.   Let your thinking be one of zililut da'as (sober-mindedness), therefore, and be kovesh es yitzro (self-controlled), for the sake of your tefillos [prayers].

8. Above all else, have fervent ahavah (agap‚) among yourselves, because ahavah (agap‚) KOL PESHA'IM T'CHASSEH ("all wrongs covers"--MISHLE 10:12).

9. Practice hachnosas orchim (hospitality) with one another without kevetching,

10. each one according as he received a mattanah (gift), as k'lei kodesh ministering to one another, mefakkechim tovim (good stewards, supervisors) of the varied Chen v'Chesed Hashem.

11. If anyone speaks, let it be as though it were the oracles of Hashem;  if anyone ministers, let it be as by the chozek (strength) which Hashem supplies, that in all things Hashem may be glorified through Moshiach Yehoshua.  Lo haKavod v'haOz l'Olemei olamim. Omein (To whom be the glory and the power into the ages of the ages.  Omein.)

12. Chaverim, do not be surprised at the massah (trial) of aish (fire) among you coming as a test for you, as though some strange thing were happening to you.

13. But in so far as you share in the sivlot (sufferings) of Moshiach, in the Chevlei haMoshiach, be glad that also in the Apocalypse of his Kavod, you may have simcha and sason.

14. If you are reproached for the shem haMoshiach, ashrei (happy, blessed) are you, because the Ruach haKodesh of Kavod and the RUACH Hashem [YESHAYAH 11:2] rests upon you.

15. Let not any of you suffer as a rotzeiach (murderer) or a ganav (thief) or an oseh ra'ah (an evil doer) or as one who is mitarev (meddlesome).

16. But if any one of you suffers as a ma'amin in Moshiach (believer in Messiah), let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify Hashem by this name.

17. Because the time has come to begin the Mishpat from the Beis Hashem;  and if the Mishpat begins from us, what will be the toitzaa (outcome) of the ones without mishma'at (obedience) to the Besuras HaGeulah of Hashem?

18. And if the Tzaddik is saved with difficulty, where will the man without chassidus [in Moshiach] and the Am ha'Aretz choteh (sinner) appear [MISHLE 11:31]?

19. Therefore, indeed, the ones undergoing sivlot according to the ratzon Hashem, let them commit their nefashot to a trustworthy Yotzer (Creator) while they continue to do ma'asim tovim.

## 1 Peter 5

1. Therefore, I give this word of chozek to the Zekenim (Elders--see Shemot 12:21) among you--I, as a  fellow Zaken (Elder) and as an 'Eidus (Witness) of the sivlot (sufferings) of Moshiach, of the Chevlei haMoshiach, and also as a partaker of the Kavod about to be unveiled;

2. Exercise the avodas hakodesh of Ro'eh (Shepherd) on behalf of the 'Eder Hashem (Flock of G-d [Yirmeyah 13:17]) among you, serving as Mashgichim Ruchaniyim (Spiritual Overseers), not unwillingly, for the sake of dishonest gelt, but willingly, eagerly, in conformity with Hashem,

3. not as domineering the ones assigned by Hashem to your oversight, but being a mofet (example) for the tzon (flock).

4. After the Sar haRo'im (Chief of Shepherds) has been manifested [1:20], you will receive the unfading 'ateret haKavod (crown of Glory).

5. Likewise, bochrim (young men), be submissive to the Zekenim (Elders) and clothe yourselves in the kaftan of anavah (humility) toward one another, because IM LALETZIM HU YALITZ V'LA'ANAYIM YITEN CHEN ("Indeed Hashem scorns the scorners, but gives grace to the humble"--MISHLE 3:34).

6. Therefore, be humbled under the mighty hand of Hashem, that you may be exalted in due time.

7. HASHLECH AL Hashem Y'HAVECHA V'HU Y'CHALKELECHA ("Cast your care on Hashem and he will sustain you"--TEHILLIM 55:23), because Hashem is concerned about you.    YOUR ADVERSARY HASATAN SAMMA'EL

8. Watch and be one characterized by zililut da'as (sober-mindedness), for your adversary Hasatan Samma'el, walks around like a roaring arye (lion), seeking whom to swallow.

9. Oppose him, firm in emunah, knowing that in Olah Hazeh, the same Chevlei [Moshiach] are to be laid upon your agudah (brotherhood), the achim in Moshiach.

10. Now the Elohei Kol haChesed (the G-d of all Grace), the one having bestowed upon you the keri'ah (calling) into his eternal kavod in Moshiach Yehoshua, will himself, after you have suffered tzoros for a little while, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen and establish you.

11. Lo hakavod v'haoz l'olemei olamim.  Omein.

12. To you, through Sila haAch haNe'eman (the Faithful Brother in Moshiach),  as such I regard him, I have written you briefly, a word of chizuk, encouraging you and giving edut (testimony) that this is the true Chen v'Chesed Hashem in which you stand.

13. Your coequal Nivcharah (Chosen One), she in Babel, sends "Shalom" greetings to you.    A FINAL SHALOM FROM TWO AUTHORS OF THE ORTHODOX JEWISH BRIT CHADASHA Also Markos, beni, sends "Shalom" greetings.

14. Greet one another with a neshikat ahavah (kiss of agap‚).  Shalom to all of you, the ones in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.
