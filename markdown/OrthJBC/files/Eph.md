# Ephesians

## Ephesians 1

1.  Sha'ul a Shliach of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua by the ratzon Hashem to the kedoshim who are in Ephesus, and who are haNe'emanim in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua;

2. Chen v'Chesed Hashem to you and shalom from Elohim Avinu and  Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua. THE BERAKHOT OF THE GEULAH B'MOSHIACH

3. Baruch hu Adonoi Avi Adoneinu Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, who has bestowed on us every birkat hanefesh in Shomayim in Moshiach,

4. just as he picked us out to be part of Hashem's Bechirim (Chosen Ones) before the hivvased tevel (foundation of the world), that we should be kedoshim and without mum (defect, Vayikra 22:20) before him.  In ahavah [Vayikra 11:44; 20:7; Shmuel Bais 22:24; Tehillim 15:2]

5. having provided the yi'ud merosh (predestination) for us to be chosen as adopted bnei brit through Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua to himself, according to the chafetz of his ratzon,

6. to the tehilat kavod of the Chen v'Chesed Hashem of him by which he freely favored us in the Moshiach HaAhuv.

7. In him we have the pedut (redemption, personal Geulah release on payment of ransom) through the [kapparah] dahm of Moshiach, the selichat chatoteinu, according to the osher of the Chen v'Chesed Hashem of him,

8. which he lavished upon us.  In all chochmah and binah,

9. having made hitgalut to us the raz of his ratzon, according to the chafetz of his ratzon, which Hashem purposed in Moshiach

10. for a pakuddat Hashem (stewardship of G-d), a plan for the fullness of time, gathering up all things in Moshiach, both the things in Shomayim and the things on ha'Aretz in him.

11. In Moshiach we have also obtained a nachalah (alloted inheritance, Tehillim 16:5-6), having been predestined according to the tochnit Hashem (purposeful and willed plan of G-d), who works all things after the counsel of his ratzon,

12. to the end that we who were HaRishonim to have tikvah in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach should be to the tehilat kevod of him.

13. In Moshiach you also, having heard the message of HaEmes, the Besuras HaGeulah of Yeshu'at Eloheinu which is yours--having also had emunah, you received your chotam (seal) in Moshiach with the Ruach Hakodesh of havtachah,

14. who is bestowed as an eravon (pledge) of our nachalah (alloted inheritance, Tehillim 16:5-6), with a view to the Geulah of Hashem's own possession, to the tehilat kevod of him. THE TEFILLAH OF RAV SHA'UL

15. Because of all of this, I, too, having heard of the emunah in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua which is yours, and having heard of your ahavah (agape) for all the kedoshim,

16. do not cease giving hodayah (thanksgiving) for you, while speaking of you in my tefillos;

17. that Hashem of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua, the Avi Hakavod, may give to you a ruach of chochmah and hitgalut in the da'as of Moshiach.[Shemot 28:3; Yeshayah 11:2]

18. It is my tefillah that the eynayim of your levavot may be  enlightened so that you may have da'as of what is the tikvah of his keri'ah (his summons from Shomayim), what is the osher of the kavod of his nachalah in the kedoshim,

19. and what is the surpassing gedulat hagevurah (greatness of his power) to us who have emunah, according to the working of the ko'ach of his might [Yeshayah 40:26]

20. which he exerted in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, when he raised him in Moshiach's Techiyas HaMesim, having seated him at his yad yamin in Shomayim,

21. far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in the Olam Hazeh but also in Olam Habah.

22. And Hashem subordinated all things under the feet of Moshiach and gave him as Rosh over all things to the Brit Chadasha Kehillah,

23. which is HaGuf HaMoshiach, [Bereshis 47:18; Tehillim 16:9-10; Iyov 19:25-27; Yeshayah 53:11] the melo (plentitude) of him, who fills all in all.

## Ephesians 2

1. And you being niftar in your pesha'im and chatta'im,

2. in which you amol (formerly) fier zich (comported oneself), according to the course of the Olam Hazeh, according to the Sar of the authority of the air [the Samekh Mem, Hasatan, teivel, the devil], the ruach now working in the bnei haMeri (sons of Rebellion).

3. Among them we too all formerly conducted ourselves in the ta'avot of our basar, following the lusts of the flesh and of the machshavot (thoughts), and we were by nature yeladim of the Charon Af Hashem, as also the rest.

4. But Hashem, being rich in rachamim, because of his ahavah harabba with which he loved us,

5. even when we were niftar in our pesha'im, he made us alive together with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach (by the unmerited Chen v'Chesed Hashem you have been delivered in your personal Geulah and the Yeshu'at Eloheinu), [Tehillim 103:12]

6. and raised us up with Moshiach and seated us with him in Shomayim in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua,

7. in order that, in the Olam HaBah, he might display the surpassing osher of the Chen v'Chesed Hashem of him in chesed toward us in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua.

8. For by unmerited Chen v'Chesed Hashem you have been delivered from Hashem's Din (Judgment) and granted a share in the Geulah (Redemption), through emunah; and this is not an ainfal of yourselves, it is a matnat Hashem (gift of G-d);

9. not the result [of the zchus (merit)] of being Torah and mitzvot observant [Acts 15:1; Gal.5:3-4], so that before Hashem no man should be a ravrevan (boaster, braggart). [Devarim 9:5]

10. For we are his masterpiece, having been created in Moshiach Yehoshua for ma'asim tovim, which Hashem prepared beforehand, that we should walk our derech in them. [Yeshayah 29:23; 42:7; 60:21;]  ACHDUT IN REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH ADONEINU, MOREINU, V'RABBEINU

11. Therefore, have zikaron that formerly you, the Goyim in the flesh, who are called "arelim" (uncircumcised ones) by the ones being called "nimolim" (circumcised ones)--which is a Bris Milah performed in the flesh by human hands--

12. have zikaron that you were at that time bazunder (unrelated and separate) from Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having been alienated from the torat haEzrakhut (the citizenship) in the Am Berit, from Yisroel, zarim (strangers) to the Beritot HaHavtacha, farfalen (lost) and having no tikvah (hope) and without G-d in the Olam Hazeh. [Yeshayah 14:1; 65:1]

13. But now in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, you, who formerly where in the outermost courts, have been brought near by the kapparah of the dahm of Moshiach.

14. For Moshiach himself is our arbitrating shalom, who made the Shneym into Echad, having broken down the barrier of the Mechitzah, the Eyvah, in the basar of Moshiach,

15. the chok (decree/law) of mishpatim in ordinances having annulled that the Shneym he might create in himself into Adam Chadash Echad, arbitrating shalom,

16. and that Moshiach might bring the ritztzuy (reconciliation, cessation of enmity), reconciling to Hashem the Shneym into one gufaniyut (corporeality) [Bereshis 47:18; Tehillim 16:9-10; Iyov 19:25-27; Yeshayah 53:11] through the Moshiach's aitz, having put to death the Eyvah by it.

17. And having come, Moshiach preached shalom to you, the ones in the outermost courts, and shalom to the ones near; [Tehillim 148:14; Yeshayah 57:19]

18. because through Moshiach we both have HaSha'ar laHashem (gate to approach G-d's presence, access of the tzaddikim --Tehillim 118:20) by one Ruach Hakodesh to Elohim HaAv.

19. Therefore, then, no longer are you zarim and aliens, but you are fellow citizens of the kedoshim and bnei bayit members of the household of G-d,

20. having been built upon the yesod (foundation) of the Shluchim and Nevi'im, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua himself being the ROSH PINAH (Tehillim 118:22),

21. in whom all the binyan (edifice), being fitly joined together, grows into a Heikhal Kadosh b'Hashem,

22. in whom also you are being built together into a Mishkan of Hashem in the Ruach Hakodesh.

## Ephesians 3

1. For this cause, I, Sha'ul, the prisoner of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua for you Goyim,

2. if indeed you heard of the pakuddat Hashem of the Chen v'Chesed Hashem having been given to me for you,

3. that according to hitgalut there was made known to me the sod of the raz, as I wrote before in brief,

4. as to which you are able by reading to have binah of my haara (insight) into the Sod HaMoshiach [the Secret of Moshiach)

5. of which in other dorot was not made known to the bnei Adam as it has now been made hitgalut to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's Shluchim and Nevi'im HaKedoshim in the Ruach Hakodesh,

6. namely, that the Nations are fellow bnei HaYerushsha (heirs) of the nachalah (alloted inheritance, Tehillim 16:5-6) and joint evarim of HaGuf HaMoshiach [Bereshis 47:18; Tehillim 16:9-10; Iyov 19:25-27; Yeshayah 53:11] and joint partakers of the havtachah (promise) in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua through the Besuras HaGeulah, [Yechezkel 47:22]

7. of which I became a keli kodesh (minister) according to the matnat Hashem of the Chen v'Chesed of G-d having been bestowed upon me, according to the working of his gevurah.

8. To me, the less than the least of all kedoshim, was given this Chen v'Chesed Hashem, to preach to the Goyim the unsearchable osher of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach,

9. and to shed light on what is the pakuddat Hashem of the Sod  that was meOlam nistar (hidden) in Hashem, who created all things,

10. in order that the many-faceted Chochmah Hashem might be made known now to the rulers and the authorities in Shomayim through the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's Brit Chadasha Kehillah.

11. This was in accordance with the tochnit Hashem (purposeful and willed plan of G-d) for the Olamim (Ages), which he implemented in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua Adoneinu,

12. in whom we have boldness and HaSha'ar laHashem (gate to approach G-d's presence, access of the tzaddikim --Tehillim 118:20) in bittachon through emunah in him.

13. Therefore, I ask you not to lose chozek concerning my tzoros on your behalf, which is for your kavod. CHOCHMAH, BINAH, AND DA'AS OF THE AHAVAH OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH

14. For this cause I fall down before HaAv,

15. from whom every mishpochah in Shomayim and on ha'Aretz is named,

16. that he may grant you according to the osher of his kavod to become mightily empowered through his Ruach Hakodesh in the inner man;

17. so that Moshiach may make his maon in your levavot through emunah, being rooted and grounded in ahavah,

18. that you may be able to have binah, together with all the kedoshim, what is the breadth and length and height and depth [Iyov 11:8,9; Tehillim 103:11]

19. and to have da'as of the ahavah of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, which ahavah surpasses da'as, in order that you may be filled to all the  melo (plentitude) of Hashem.

20. Now to the One who is able to do exceedingly abundantly, beyond all that we ask or think, according to the ko'ach working in us. [Melachim Alef 3:13]

21. To him be kavod in the Brit Chadasha Kehillah and in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, bekhol hadorot l'Olam va'ed.  Omein.

## Ephesians 4

1. Therefore I impart chizzuk (strengthening) to you, I, the prisoner of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu, and I admonish you to walk and fier zich (comport oneself) in your derech in a manner worthy of the keri'ah by which you were called,

2. with all anavah (humility) of mind and meekness, with savlanut (long-suffering), showing forbearance to one another in ahavah,

3. being eager to keep the achdus (unity) of the Ruach Hakodesh in the uniting bond of shalom;

4. as there is one guf (body) [Bereshis 47:18; Tehillim 16:9-10; Iyov 19:25-27; Yeshayah 53:11 and one Ruach Hakodesh, as also you were called in one tikvah (hope) of your ke'riah:

5. Adon echad, emunah achat, tevilah achat,

6. one G-d and Avi-khol (Father of all), who is over all and through all and in all. [Devarim 6:4; Zecharyah 14:9]

7. But to each of us was given the Chen v'Chesed Hashem according to the measure of the Matnat HaMoshiach.

8. Therefore it says, ALITA LAMMAROM SHAVITA SHEVI LAKACHTA MATANOT ("You ascended to the height you led captive, you received gifts"--Tehillim 68:19 [68:18]), he has led captive a host of captives, he had brought matanot to bnei Adam.

9. Now if he "ASCENDED" what can it mean except that also he descended into the lower parts of ha'aretz?

10. The One who descended is himself also the One having ascended far above all the Shomayim, that he might fill all things. [Mishle 30:1-4]  ON THE AVODAS KODESH MINISTRY OF THE BRIT CHADASHA KEHILLAH;    ON THE ACHDUT (UNITY) OF MOSHIACH AND HAGUF HAMOSHIACH ON HA'ARETZ, THE BRIT CHADASHA KEHILLAH

11. And he gave some to be shluchim, and some nevi'im, and some gifted to be used in Kiruv efforts for Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and some supervising mashgichim ruchaniyim (spiritual overseers) who are ro'im and morim in the kehillah,

12. for the equipping of the kedoshim for the work of avodas kodesh ministry, to the building up of HaGuf HaMoshiach [Bereshis 47:18; Tehillim 16:9-10; Iyov 19:25-27; Yeshayah 53:11]

13. until we all attain to the achdus (unity) of the emunah and at the da'as of the Ben HaElohim, at the Bnei Chayil maturity, to the measure of the stature of the melo of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.

14. In this way, we are no longer olalim (infants) tossed by waves and carried around by every wind of limmud (instruction), by the cunning of bnei Adam, with craftiness leading to the scheming of remiyah (deceit) and madduchei shav (delusion); [Yeshayah 57:20]

15. but telling HaEmes in ahavah, let us grow up in every respect unto him who is the Rosh, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach,

16. from whom all HaGuf HaMoshiach [Bereshis 47:18; Tehillim 16:9-10; Iyov 19:25-27; Yeshayah 53:11]--being fitly joined together and being united in an aggudas by that which every joint contributes according to each part's proper working process--  promotes the growth of HaGuf HaMoshiach in building itself up in ahavah.

17. This therefore I say and give solemn edut in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu: no longer are you to fier zich (comport oneself) in your derech as also the Goyim walk, in the futility of their machshavot (thoughts),

18. their binah (understanding) being in choshech, having been alienated from the life of Hashem because of the ignorance existing in them, because of the KESHI (stubbornness, hardness DEVARIM 9:27) of their levavot, [Devarim 29:4]

19. who, having put away remorse, gave themselves over to zimah (lewdness) for the practice of every kind of tumah with chamdanut.

20. But you did not so have lernen of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach,

21. if indeed you heard about him and took shiurim in him, as HaEmes is in Yehoshua.  ON THE NEED FOR TESHUVA AND HITKHADESHUT (REGENERATION) AND "CHANGING CLOTHES IN MOSHIACH" SO THAT WE ABANDON NOT ONLY LASHON HORA BUT THE UNREGENERATE SELF AND ARE PERSONALLY TRANSFORMED IN REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH FOR THE YOM HAGEULAH (THE DAY OF REDEMPTION)

22. For the torah you received was that you must disrobe from your former derech of your old self, the one being corrupted according to the ta'avot of remiyah (guile, deceit) [Yirmeyah 17:9]

23. and to be renewed by the Ruach Hakodesh controlling your machshavot (thoughts)

24. and to enrobe yourself in the Adam HeChadash (the new humanity) having been created according to the demut Hashem in tzidkat Eloheinu and in the kedushah of HaEmes.

25. Therefore, disrobed from Sheker, let us speak HaEmes, each one with his re'a (neighbor), because we are evarim one of another. [Tehillim 15:2; Vayikra 19:11; Zecharyah 8:16] AL TIFTAH PEH L'SATAN ("DO NOT GIVE THE ADVERSARY AN OPENING")

26. Have ka'as and do not sin; do not let the shemesh go down on your anger, [Tehillim 4:4]

27. nor [by the yetzer hara] give opportunity to Hasatan.

28. Let the one stealing no longer be a ganav, but rather let  the ganav get a parnasah and toil with his own hands at something beneficial, that he may have something to share with the one who is nitzrach (needy).

29. Let no lashon hora proceed out of your peh, but only a dvar that is tov, for edification in accordance with the need, that it may mediate Chen v'Chesed Hashem to the ones hearing.

30. And do not grieve the Ruach Hakodesh of Hashem, by whom you were sealed for the Yom HaGeulah. [Yeshayah 63:10]

31. Let all merirut lev (bitterness) and ka'as and wrath and clamor and lashon hora be removed from you, with all resha.

32. And have chen v'chesed (graciousness) with another.  Be kind, tender hearted, forgiving each other, as also Hashem in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach forgave you.

## Ephesians 5

1. Therefore, be imitators of Hashem as beloved yeladim,

2. and fier zich (comport oneself) in your derech in ahavah, as also Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had ahavah for us and gave himself up on behalf of us as a korban and zevach to Hashem for a RE'ACH HANNICHOACH ("a pleasant aroma" Bereshis 8:21).

3. But do not let zenut (fornication) or anything tumah or chamdanut even be named among you, as is proper for kedoshim.

4. And also let there be nothing that is an ERVAT DAVAR (indecent thing) or the tipshus or foolish talking of letzim or coarse jesting or shtiklech, which are not fitting, but rather hodayah (thanksgiving).

5. For of this you have da'as vada (with certainty), that every zoneh (fornicator) or impure person or covetous person (chamdanut is avodah zarah, avodah elilim) does not have a nachalah in the Malchut of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and of Hashem.  TO WALK THE DERECH OF YELADIM OF HAOHR

6. Let no one deceive you with empty dvarim. For, because of these things the Charon Af Hashem comes upon the bnei haMeri (sons of Rebellion).

7. Therefore, do not be shuttafim (partners) with them.

8. For you were once Choshech, but now you are Ohr (Light) in Hashem. Fier zich (comport oneself) in your derech as yeladim of HaOhr.

9. For the p'ri HaOhr is in doing chesed and tzedek and emes,

10. proving that which is well-pleasing be'einei Hashem.

11. And do not involve yourself in the ma'asei haChoshech (works of darkness), those works without p'ri; but rather even expose them.

12. For as to the things being done by them under cover of secrecy, it brings bushah and is a bizayon (disgrace) even to speak of them.

13. But everything being exposed by HaOhr (Light) becomes visible,

14. for everything becoming visible is HaOhr (Light); therefore here is the meaning of these words, KUMI, ("Rise up!" YESHAYAH 51:17; 60:1), sleeper, AND ARISE FROM THE MESIM, (YESHAYAH 26:19) AND Moshiach WILL SHINE ON YOU (YESHAYAH 60:1-2). [Yeshayah 26:19; 60:1; Malachi 4:2]

15. Therefore, fier zich (comport oneself) in your derech with a careful walk, not as kesilim but as chachamim,

16. redeeming the time, because the yamim are ra'im.

17. Therefore, do not be foolish, but have binah of what the ratzon Hashem is.

18. And do not become shikker with schnaps, in which is dissipation, but be filled with the Ruach Hakodesh, [Vayikra 10:9; Mishle 20:1; Yeshayah 28:7] 


 A WORD TO THE CHAZZANIM AND MESHORORIM (SINGERS) CALLING FOR ZEMIROS (SHABBOS TABLE SONGS) AND NUSACH HATEFILLAH (PRAYER CHANTS) IN THE RUACH HAKODESH

19. speaking to one another in Tehillim and shirim and hymns and neshamah niggunim miRuach Hakodesh (soul melodies from the Ruach Hakodesh), singing and making melody in your levavot to Adonoi, [Tehillim 27:6]

20. giving todot always for everything to Eloheinu, even Avinu b'Shem Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua [Iyov 1:21; Tehillim 34:1]

21. being submissive to one another in the yirat HaMoshiach.

22. Nashim (wives), make yourselves accountable to your ba'alim as to Adoneinu, [Bereshis 3:16]

23. because a ba'al is rosh of the isha as also Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach is rosh of the Brit Chadasha Kehillah, being himself the Moshi'a (Savior) of HaGuf HaMoshiach. [Bereshis 47:18; Tehillim 16:9-10; Iyov 19:25-27; Yeshayah 53:11]

24. But as the Brit Chadasha Kehillah is accountable to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, so also the nashim should be to their ba'alim in everything.

25. Ba'alim, have ahavah for your nashim, as also Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach has ahavah for the Brit Chadasha Kehillah and gave  himself up on behalf of her,

26. that he might bring her to kedusha, having given her tohorah (purification) by the tevilah of the mayim in the dvar,

27. that he might present to himself [as a kallah] the Brit Chadasha Kehillah in all her kavod TAMIM (unblemished, SHEMOT 12:5; VAYIKRA 22:20; YESHAYAH 53:7-9) and without wrinkle or any such things, but that she may be kedoshah and without blemish.  FINAL DIVREI TORAH ON SHALOM BAYIS

28. So also the ba'alim ought to show ahavah for their own nashim as their own gufim; [Bereshis 2:23-24] the one with ahavah for his own isha has ahavah for himself,

29. for no one ever had sin'as chinom for his own basar but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach also does the Brit Chadasha Kehillah,

30. because we are evarim of HaGuf HaMoshiach. [Bereshis 47:18; Tehillim 16:9-10; Iyov 19:25-27; Yeshayah 53:11]

31. AL KEN YA'AZAV ISH ES AVIV V'ES IMMO V'DAVAK BE'ISHTO V'HAYU LEVASAR ECHAD  ("Because of this a man will leave his father and his mother and will be joined to the wife of him and the two will be one basar.") [Bereshis 2:24]

32. This is a sod hagadol, but I am referring to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and the Brit Chadasha Kehillah. [Shir HaShirim 3:6-4:12; Bereshis 2:23,24; 24:1-7; 41:45; 47:18; Shemot 2:21; Ruth 1:16-17; 3:9]

33. Each of you, however, should show ahavah for his isha as himself, and an isha should kabed es haba'al (respect, honor the husband).

## Ephesians 6

1. Yeladim, obey your horim (parents) in Adoneinu, for this is right. [Mishle 6:20]

2. KAVED ES AVICHA V'ES IMMECHA [SHEMOT 20:12; DEVARIM 5:16], (which is the mitzvah harishonah with a havtacha),

3. that it may be well with you and you will be a long time on ha'aretz.

4. And, Avot, do not provoke your yeladim to ka'as, but nurture them in the musar of Hashem and his tokhechah (reproof). [Bereshis 18:19; Devarim 6:7; Mishle 13:24; 22:6]

5. Avadim (servants), serve with mishma'at (obedience) your adonim according to the basar B'YIR'AH ("with fear") and BIRA'DAH ("with trembling") [TEHILLIM 2:11] with your levavot of erlichkeit (sincerety) as to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach,

6. not with eye service as men-pleasers, being mehaneh to bnei Adam, but as avadim (servants) of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, doing the ratzon Hashem  from your levavot.

7. Render your service with a tov lev as avadim unto Adoneinu and not unto bnei Adam,

8. having da'as that whatever ma'aseh tov each one does, this he will receive back from Hashem, whether he is an eved or a Ben Chorim.

9. And, adonim, do the same things to them, forbearing threatening, having da'as that both their and your Adon is in Shomayim, and ein masso panim im Hashem (there is no partiality with Hashem). [Iyov 31:13,14]

10. For the rest, be continually empowered in the ko'ach of Hashem and in the oz of his gevurah. [Tehillim 27:14]
 MUKHAN UMEZUMAN ("BEHOLD, I AM READY AND SPIRITUALLY PREPARED"); AGAINST THE SITRA AHRA (POWERS OF EVIL AND DARKNESS)

11. Put on the whole armor of Hashem for you to be able to stand against the nechalim (schemes, wiles, evil plots) of Hasatan.

12. Because we are not wrestling against basar vadahm, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of the choshech of the Olam Hazeh, against the kokhot ruchaniyim ra'im in Shomayim.

13. Therefore, take up the whole armor of Hashem, that you may be able to withstand in the Yom HaRah and, having done all, to stand.

14. Stand, therefore, having girded your waist with HaEmes and having put on the breastplate of Tzedek, [Yeshayah 11:5; Tehillim 132:9; Yeshayah 59:17]

15. and having put as shoes on your feet that which makes you ready to be a maggid of the Besuras HaGeulah. [Yeshayah 52:7]

16. With all these things, take up the shield of emunah, by which you will be able to quench all the flaming darts of harah (the evil one);

17. and take the helmet of yeshu'a and the cherev of the Ruach Hakodesh, which is the dvar Hashem. [Yeshayah 59:17; 49:2]

18. Daven in the Ruach Hakodesh always with all tefillos and techinnah (supplication).  To that end keep shomer and always persevere in techinnah for the kedoshim;

19. and for me also, that to me may be given utterance in opening my mouth in boldness to make known the Sod HaBesuras HaGeulah,

20. on behalf of which I am an emissary in chains, that in it I may be bold as it is necessary for me to speak.

21. But that you may also know my affairs, and what I am doing, Tychicus the Ach b'Moshiach and chaver and keli kodesh (minister) who is ne'eman in Hashem,

22. whom I sent to you for this very reason, that you may have da'as of the things concerning us and he may impart chizzuk (strengthening) to your levavot.

23. Shalom to the Achim b'Moshiach, and ahavah with emunah from Elohim HaAv and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua.

24. Chen v'Chesed Hashem be with all the ones who have ahavah for Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu with an incorruptible ahavah.
