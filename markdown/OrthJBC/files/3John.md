# 3 John

## 3 John 1

1.  From the Zeken (Elder, SHEMOT 3:16) To Gaius haAhuv (the beloved), whom I love b'Emes.

2. Chaver, I pray all may be hatzlocha (a success) with you, and that you may be shalem b'guf (healthy), just as your nefesh (soul) is matsli'ach (successful).

3.  For I had simcha gedola (much joy) when the achim b'Moshiach (brothers in Moshiach) arrived and gave edut (testimony) of you being in haEmes (the Truth), just as your walk is Halicha b'Derech Emes (conduct in the Way of Truth).

4.  I have no greater simcha than this, to hear of my bnei b'Moshiach (sons in Moshiach), that their walk is Halicha b'Derech Emes. 
 REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S KIRUV RECHOKIM                   THROUGH AHAVAH AND HAEMES

5.  Chaver, you do a thing of emunah (faith) when it is done for the achim b'Moshiach, especially when they are zarim (strangers).

6. They gave `edut (testimony) to your ahavah (agapâ€š) before the kehillah (assembly); you will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of the ratson Hashem (will of G-d).

7.  For, on behalf of Hashem they went forth [in Moshiach's Kiruv Rechokim], taking nothing from the Goyim.

8. Therefore, we ought to give hachnosas orchim (hospitality) to such, in order that we may be ozrim (helpers) with haEmes.

9.  I wrote something to the kehillah; but Diotrephes, who has fallen in love with being first among them, being "rosh ha`edat" ("head of the congregation"), does not receive us.

10. So if I come, I will remember his "ma'asim" ("works") which he does, his bringing unjustified charges against us with loshon horah (evil speech).  And not being satisfied with performing these "mitzvot", he even refuses to receive the achim b'Moshiach, and, those intending to do so, he hinders and expels out of the kehillah.

11.  Chaver, do not imitate haRah (Evil); rather, imitate haTov (Good).  The one doing haTov is from Hashem.  The one doing haRah has not regarded Hashem.

12.  To Demetrius, edut (testimony) has been given by all and, personally, by no less than haEmes (the Truth); we also give edut (testimony), and you know that our edut is amitti (True).

13. I had many things to write to you, but I do not want to write to you with pen and ink.

14. But I have the tikvah (hope) to see you imminently, and we will speak panim el panim (directly, in person).  Shalom to you.  The Chaverim send you "shalom" greetings.  Greet the Chaverim each by name with "Shalom."
