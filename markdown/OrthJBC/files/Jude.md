# Jude

## Jude 1

1. From Yehuda, eved (servant) of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua and a brother of Ya'akov;  To haKeru'im (the Called Ones), beloved in Elohim haAv and Hashemurim (the Guarded ones) for Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua.

2. Rachamim Hashem and Shalom Hashem and Ahavas Hashem to you abundantly!   
 THE ORTHODOX JEWISH FAITH AND THE TRUE GEULAH

3. Chaverim, although I was very eager to write to you concerning the Geulah (Redemption) we share, it suddenly became necessary to write you an urgent appeal to fight for the (correct orthodox Jewish) Emunah (Faith, the Emunah of the true Dat haYehudit), which was once for all time handed over and transmitted to the Kedoshim.

4. For certain men, anshei resha (men of wickedness) written down long ago [in the seferim of Hashem] for this harsha'ah (condemnation) [Dan.7:10; Rev.20:12; I Pet.2:8], have infiltrated our ranks, men twisting the Chen v'Chesed haEloheynu into a license for sensual self-indulgence and denying our only Ribboneynu and Adoneynu Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua. 
 THE COMING MUSAR OF AISH OLAM FOR THOSE WHO TURN ASIDE FROM THE DERECH TZEDEK AND INDULGE IN ZENUT (FORNICATION) AND PERVERSION

5. Now I wish to remind you, though you are fully informed, that Hashem, who once saved a people from the land of Mitzrayim (Egypt), afterwards destroyed every Apikoros not having Emunah (Faith).

6. And you know about the malachim (angels), not being content to keep their positions of Memshalet (Rule/Dominion), having deserted their own station, these malachim Hashem has kept chained forever under choshech [see II Pet.2:4] for the Mishpat haYom haGadol, the Judgment of the Great Day [the Yom haDin, the Day of Judgment].

7. As S'dom and Amora and the cities around them, in a doime (similar) manner to these, indulging in sexual immorality against the course of nature and turning aside and going after alien flesh, are set forth to lie in public view as an example, undergoing the musar (punishment, Yeshayah 53:5) of Aish Olam (Eternal Fire, Yeshayah 66:24; Mt. 25:46; Rev.20:10).      MOREI SHEKER AND THEIR REBELLION AGAINST THE MEMSHALAH INSTITUTED BY HASHEM

8. Likewise, indeed, these ["certain men," 1:4], these dreamers, on the one hand, pollute the basar (flesh); on the other hand, they do not recognize the memshalah (rule) of glorious heavenly beings; instead, they speak lashon hora with slanderous railing against them.

9. By contrast, Micha'el the Sar haMalachim (Dan.10:13), when he took issue with haSatan and disputed about the geviyat Moshe Rabbeinu (corpse of Moses), did not presume to pronounce a slanderous judgment [against haSatan], but said, "May Hashem rebuke you!"

10. But, on the one hand, these [men] slander whatever they do not understand; on the other hand, what they do understand instinctively, like unreasoning animals, by these things they are destroyed.

11. Oy to them!  Because they walked in the Derech Kayin (Bereshit 4:3-8) and to the to'at Balaam (error of Balaam, Bamidbar 31:16) they surrendered for gain, and in the mered (rebellion) of Korach against haMemshalah (Bamidbar 16:1-35) they were destroyed!

12. These [men] are hidden reefs [moored at] your seudas (agapâ€š-feasts), feasting with you without yirat Shomayim, shepherding themselves, waterless clouds being carried away by winds, autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, torn up from their shorashim (roots),

13. wild waves of the sea, foaming up their ma'asim hara'im (evil deeds), wandering kochavim (stars) for whom the shvartz gloom of choshech has been reserved adei ad (forever).

14. But also it was about these [men] that Enoch, in the seventh [generation] from Adam, prophesied, saying, "Hinei!  Hashem comes with His ten thousands of malachim

15. for the purpose of bringing all to Mishpat and for the purpose of proving guilty every neshamah of all of its deeds done without yirat Shomayim and of all the harsh things chatta'im (sinners) without yirat Shomayim spoke against Him."

16. These [men] are malcontents and faultfinders, walking according to their ta'avot (lusts); their mouth speaks arrogant things, flattering for the purpose of financial advantage.
 REMEMBER THE NEVU'0T OF MOSHIACH'S SHLUCHIM

17. But you, Chaverim, keep in mind the predictions (II Pet.3:3) of the Shluchim of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu  Yehoshua,

18. because they were telling you that at Acharit haYamim (the End of Days), there will be leitzim (scoffers, Tehillim 1:1) walking according to their ta'avot without yir'at Shomayim.

19. These [men] are the ones causing division, worldly men, not having the Ruach Hakodesh. BUILD YOURSELF UP ON THE KITVEI HAKODESH

20. But you, Chaverim, build yourselves up on your most holy, (correct, orthodox Jewish) Emunah (Faith), the Emunah of the true Dat haYehudit, davening in the Ruach Hakodesh.

21. Keep yourselves in the Ahavas Hashem, awaiting the rachamim of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua unto Chayyei Olam.  HAVING RACHAMIM, BUT BEING MECHALEK (DIFFERENTIATING)

22. To those who are wavering, show rachamim; others, deliver, snatching them out of the Aish [Olam];

23. On others, have rachamim mixed with yirat Shomayim, hating even the undergarment defiled by corrupt human nature. BIRKAT HAPRIDAH (PARTING BLESSING)

24. Now to the One who is able to stand shomer over you, to make you moineia (prevented) you from falling, and to set you unblemished in the presence of his Shechinah, with sason rav (much rejoicing),

25. to haElohim Hayachid Moshieynu (to the only G-d our Savior), through Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua, be HaKavod (Glory) and HaGedulah ( Greatness) and HaMemshalah (Rule) and HaGevurah (Might) mei-olam v'ad atah v'ad olemei olamim (before all time, now, and forever.) Omein.
