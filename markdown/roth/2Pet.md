# 2 Peter

## 2 Peter 1

__So then, let, them who are even suffering, according to the will of God, unto a faithful Creator, be committing their souls, in well-doing.__

1. Simon Peter, servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, unto them who have obtained, equally precious, faith, with us, in the righteousness of our God, and Saviour Jesus Christ,

2. Favour unto you, and peace, be multiplied, in the personal knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord;

3. As, all things, suited for life and godliness his divine power, unto us, hath given, through the personal knowledge of him that hath called us through glory and excellence,

4. Through which, his precious, and very great, promises, have, unto us, been given, in order that, through these, ye might become sharers in a divine natureescaping the corruption that is in the world by coveting.

5. And, for this very reason alsoadding, on your part, all diligence, supply, in your faith, excellence, and, in your excellence, knowledge,

6. And, in your knowledge, self-control, and, in your self-control, endurance, and, in your endurance, godliness,

7. And, in your godliness, brotherly affection, and, in your brotherly affection, love.

8. These things, unto you, belonging and abounding, neither idle nor unfruitful, constitute you, regarding the personal knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ;

9. For, he to whom these things are not present, is, blind, seeing only what is near, having come, to forget, his purification from his old sins.

10. Wherefore, all the more, brethren, give diligence to be making, firm, your calling and election; for, these things, doing, in nowise shall ye stumble at any time,

11. For, thus, shall richly be further supplied unto youthe entrance into the age-abiding kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

12. Wherefore, I shall be certain to be, always, putting you in remembrance concerning these things,although, indeed, ye know them, and have become confirmed in the present truth;

13. Right, nevertheless, I account itas long as I am in this tent, to be stirring you up by putting you in remembrance,

14. Knowing that, speedy, is the putting off of my tenteven as, our Lord Jesus Christ also, made clear to me:

15. Yea, I will give diligence also, that, at every time, ye may be able, after my own departure, to be keeping up the remembrance of, these very things.

16. For, not as having followed, cleverly devised stories, made we known unto you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, but as having been made, spectators, of his majesty.

17. For, when he received from God the Father honour and glory, a voice, being borne to him such as this, by the magnificent gloryMy Son, the beloved, is, this, in whom, I, delight,

18. Even this voice, we, heard, when, out of heaven, it was borne, we being, with him, in the holy mount.

19. And we have, more firm, the prophetic word;whereunto ye are doing, well, to take heed,as unto a lamp shining in a dusky place,until, day, shall dawn, and, a day-star, shall arise in your hearts:

20. Of this, first, taking notethat, no prophecy of scripture, becometh, self-solving;

21. For not, by will of man, was prophecy brought in, at any time, but, as, by Holy Spirit, they were borne along, spake, men, from God.

## 2 Peter 2

1. But there arose false-prophets also among the people, as, among you also, there shall be, false-teachers,men who will stealthily bring in destructive parties, even the Master that bought them, denying, bringing upon themselves speedy destruction;

2. And, many, will follow out their wanton ways,by reason of whom, the way of truth, will be defamed,

3. And, in greed, with forged words, will they, of you, make merchandise: for whom, the sentence from of old, is not idle, and, their destruction, doth not slumber.

4. Forif, God, spared not, messengers, when they sinned, but, to pits of gloom, consigning them, in the lowest hades, delivered them up to be kept, unto judgment,

5. And, an ancient world, spared not, but, with seven others, preserved, Noah, a proclaimer, of righteousness, a flood, upon a world of ungodly persons, letting loose,

6. And, the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, reducing to ashes, he condemned, an example of such as should be ungodly, having set forth,

7. And, righteous Lot, when getting worn out by the behaviour of them who were impious in wantonness, he rescued

8. For, in seeing and hearing, since he dwelt right among them, as a righteous man, he used to torment his soul, day by day, with their lawless deeds

9. fehlt

10. Most of all, however, them who go their way, after the flesh, with a coveting of defilement, and who despise, lordship,daring! willful! before dignitaries, they tremble not, defaming,

11. where, messengers, though, greater in might and power, are not bringing against them  before the Lord  a defamatory accusation,

12. These, however, as unreasoning creatures that have been bred as being, by nature, for capture and destruction, in the things they are ignorant of, uttering defamation, in their spoiling, shall also be made a spoil,

13. Doing wrong themselves, for a reward of wrong, accounting, a delight, their day-time delicacy, spots and blemishes, indulging in delicacies with their stratagems, as they carouse together with you,

14. Having, eyes, full of an adulteress, and that cannot rest from sin, enticing unstable souls, having, a heart trained in greed,children of a curse,

15. Forsaking a straight path, they have gone astray, following out the way of Balaam   of Beor, who loved, a reward of wrong,

16. But had, a reproof, of his own transgression, a dumb beast of burden, in mans voice, finding utterance, forbade the prophets madness.

17. These, are fountains without water, and mists, by a tempest, driven along,for whom, the gloom of darkness, hath been reserved;

18. For, great swelling words of vanity, uttering, they entice with carnal covetingsin wanton waysthem who are, well-nigh, escaping from the men who, in error, have their behaviour;

19. Promising, freedom to them, they themselves, being all the while, slaves of corruption,for, by whom one hath been defeated, by the same, hath he become enslaved,

20. For, if, having escaped from the defilements of the world by a personal knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, but, by the same having again become entangled, they are defeated, the, last, state hath become, for them, worse than, the first;

21. For, better, had it been for themnot to have obtained a personal knowledge of the way of righteousness, than, having obtained such knowledge, to turn back out of the holy commandment delivered unto them.

22. There hath befallen them the thing

## 2 Peter 3

1. This, already, beloved, is the second letter I am writing unto you; and, in these letters, I am stirring upby way of calling to remembranceyour uncorrupted mind,

2. To remember the fore-spoken declarations made by the holy prophets, and the commandment of the Lord and Saviour, by your apostles.

3. Of this, first, taking notethat there will come, in the last of the days, with scoffing, scoffers, after their own covetings, going on,

4. and sayingWhere is the promise of his presence? For, since the fathers fell asleep, all things, thus remain, from the beginning of creation.

5. For this they, willfully, forgetthat there were, heavens, from of old, and, an earth, on account of water and by means of water, compacted, by Gods word,

6. By which means, the world that then was, with water being flooded, perished;

7. While, the heavens and the earth that now are, by the same word, have been stored with fire, being kept unto the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly men.

8. But, this one thing, forget not, beloved,that, one day, with the Lord, is as a thousand years, and, a thousand years, as one day.

9. The Lord is, not slack, concerning his promise, as some count, slackness; but is long-suffering with regard to you, not being minded that any should perish, but that, all, unto repentance, should come.

10. Howbeit the day of the Lord will be here, as a thief,in which, the heavens, with a rushing noise, will pass away, while, elements, becoming intensely hot, will be dissolved, and, earth, and the works therein, will be discovered.

11. Seeing that all these things are thus to be dissolved, what manner of persons, ought  ye  all the while to be, in holy ways of behaviour and acts of godliness,

12. Expecting and hastening the presence of the day of God, by reason of which, heavens, being on fire, will be dissolved, and, elements, becoming intensely hot, are to be melted;

13. But, new heavens, and a new earth, according to his promise, are we expecting, wherein, righteousness, is to dwell.

14. Wherefore, beloved, these things, expectinggive diligence, unspotted and unblemished, by him, to be found, in peace;

15. And account, our Lords long suffering,   salvation:even as, our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given unto him, hath written unto you;

16. As also, in all letters, speaking in them concerning these things,in which   are some things, hard to be understood, which, the uninstructed and unstable, wrest,as also the other scriptures,unto their own destruction.

17. Ye, therefore, beloved, taking note beforehand, be on your guard, lest, with the error of the impious being led away, ye fall from your own steadfastness;

18. But be growing in the favour and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ:unto whom be the glory, both now and unto a day that abideth.
