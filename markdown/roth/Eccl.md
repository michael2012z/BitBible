## Ecclesiastes 1

__Surely, the pressing of milk, bringeth forth curd, and, the pressing of the nose, bringeth forth blood, and, the pressing of wrath, bringeth forth strife.__

1. The words of the Proclaimer, son of David, king in Jerusalem.

2. Vanity of vanities! saith the Proclaimer, vanity of vanities! all, is vanity.

3. What profit hath Man, in all his toil wherewith he toileth under the sun?

4. Generation, goeth and, generation, cometh, but, the earth, unto times age-abiding, remaineth.

5. And the sun, breaketh forth, and the sun, goeth in,yea, unto his own place, he panteth, from whence he brake forth.

6. Going unto the south, and circling unto the north,circling, circling continually, is, the wind, and, over its own circuits, returneth the wind.

7. All the streams, flow into the sea, yet, the sea, is not full,unto the place whither the streams flow, thither, do they again flow.

8. All words, are weak, unable is any man to tell,not satisfied is the eye by seeing, nor filled is the ear with hearing.

9. That which hath been, is the same that shall be, and, that which hath been done, is the same that shall be done,and there is, nothing new, under the sun.

10. Is there a thing, of which it can be said, See here, it is, new? Already, hath it been, for ages,   which was before us.

11. There is, no remembrance, of the thing before,nor, even of the things after, which shall be, will there be any remembrance, with them who shall come after.

12. I, the Proclaimer, was king over Israel, in Jerusalem.

13. And I gave my heart to seek and to search out, wisely, concerning all things which are done under the heavens,the same, is the vexatious employment God hath given to the sons of men, to work toilsomely therein,

14. I saw all the works which were done under the sun,and lo! all, was vanity, and a feeding on wind.

15. That which is crooked, cannot be straight,and, that which is wanting, cannot be reckoned.

16. Spake, I, in my heart, saying, As for me, lo! I have become great, and have gathered wisdom, beyond any one who hath been before me over Jerusalem,and, my heart, hath seen much wisdom and knowledge:

17. yea I have given my heart, to know wisdom, and to know madness, and folly,I know that, even this, is a feeding on wind.

18. For, in much wisdom, is much vexation,and, he that increaseth knowledge, increaseth pain.

## Ecclesiastes 2

1. Said, I, in my heart, Come now! I will prove thee with gladness, and look thou on blessedness,but lo! even that, was vanity.

2. Of laughter, I said, Madness! and, of mirth, What can it do?

3. I sought out with my heart, to cherish with wine, my flesh,but, my heart, was to guide with wisdom, even in laying hold of folly, until I should see which was blessedness for the sons of men, as to that which they could do, under the heavens, during the number of the days of their life.

4. I enlarged my works,I built me houses, I planted me vineyards;

5. I made me gardens, and parks,I planted in them trees of every kind of fruit;

6. I made me pools of water,to irrigate therefrom the thick-set saplings growing up into trees:

7. I acquired, men-servants and women-servants, and, the children of the household, were mine,also possessions, herds and flocks in abundance, were mine, beyond all who had been before me in Jerusalem;

8. I heaped me up, both silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings, and provinces,I provided me singing-men and singing-women, and the delights of the sons of men, a wife and wives.

9. So I became great, and increased, more than any one who had been before me in Jerusalem,moreover, my wisdom, remained with me;

10. and, nothing that mine eyes asked, withheld I from them,I did not keep back my heart from any gladness, for, my heart, obtained gladness out of all my toil, and so, this, was my portion, out of all my toil.

11. When, I, looked upon all my works, which my hands had made, and on my toil, whereon I had toilsomely wrought, then lo! all, was vanity, and feeding on wind, and there was no profit under the sun.

12. Thus turned, I, to look at wisdom, and madness and folly,for what can the man   that which, already, men have done.

13. Then saw, I, that wisdom doth excel folly,as far as light excelleth darkness.

14. As for the wise man, his eyes, are in his head, whereas, the dullard, in darkness, doth walk,but, I myself, knew that, one destiny, happeneth to them, all.

15. Then said, I, in my heart, As it happeneth to the dullard, even to me, will it happen, but wherefore, then, became, I, wise to excess? Therefore spake I, in my heart, Even this, is vanity.

16. For there is no remembrance of a wise man, more than of a dullard, unto times age-abiding,seeing that, already, in the days to come, all hath been forgotten, how then cometh it that the wise man dieth equally with the dullard?

17. Therefore I hated life, for, a vexation unto me, was the work which was done under the sun,for, all, was vanity, and a feeding on wind.

18. Therefore hated, I, all my toil, wherein I was toiling, under the sun,in that I should leave it for the man who should come after me;

19. and who could know whether a, wise man, he would be or a foolish, and yet he would lord it over all my toil, wherein I had toiled and wherein I had acted wisely, under the sun,even this, was vanity.

20. Then resolved I, to give my heart over to despair,concerning all the toil, wherein I had toiled, under the sun.

21. For here is a man, whose toil hath been with wisdom and with knowledge and with skill,yet, to a man who hath not toiled therein, shall he leave it as his portion, even this, was vanity and a great vexation.

22. For what hath the man for all his toil, and for the striving of his heart,wherein, he himself, toiled under the sun?

23. For, all his days, are pains, and, vexatious, is his employment, even in the night, his heart lieth not down,even this, was, vanity.

24. There was nothing more blessed for Man   that he should eat and drink, and see his desireth for blessedness in his toil,even this, saw, I myself, that, from the hand of God, it was.

25. For who could eat and who could enjoy, so well as I?

26. For, to a man who is good before him, hath he given wisdom and knowledge and gladness,whereas, to the sinner, he hath given employment, to gather and heap up, to give to one who is good before God, even this, was vanity, and a feeding on wind.

## Ecclesiastes 3

1. For, every thing, there is a season,and a time for every pursuit, under the heavens:

2. A time to be born, and a time to die,A time to plant, and a time to uproot what is planted;

3. A time to kill, and a time to heal,A time to break down, and a time to build up;

4. A time to weep, and a time to laugh,A time to wail, and a time to dance for joy;

5. A time to cast away stones, and a time to heap up stones,A time to embrace, and a time to be far from loving embrace;

6. A time to seek, and a time to give up as lost,A time to keep, and a time to cast away;

7. A time to rend, and a time to sew,A time to be silent, and a time to speak;

8. A time to love and a time to hate,A time of war, and a time of peace.

9. What profit hath he that worketh, in that wherein, himself, hath toiled?

10. I looked at the employment which God hath given to the sons of men, to work therein:

11. Everything, hath he made beautiful in its own time,also, intelligence, hath he put in their heart, without which men could not find out the work which God hath wrought, from the beginning even unto the end.

12. I know that there is no blessedness in them,save to be glad, and to do well with ones life.

13. Though indeed, that any man should eat and drink, and see blessedness, in all his toil, it is, the gift of God.

14. I know, that, whatsoever God doeth, the same, shall be age-abiding, unto it, there is nothing to add, and, from it, there is nothing to take away,and, God, hath done it, that men should stand in awe before him.

15. That which was, already, had been, and, that which shall be, already, shall have been,but, God, seeketh that which hath been chased away.

16. Then, again, I saw under the sun, the place of justice, that there was lawlessness, and, the place of righteousness, that there was lawlessness.

17. Said, I, in my heart, Both the righteous and the lawless, will God judge,for   a time for every pursuit, and concerning every workthere.

18. Said, I, in my heart, as concerning the sons of men, That God was minded to prove them,and that they might see, that they were beasts, of themselves.

19. For, as regardeth the destiny of the sons of men and the destiny of beasts, one fate, have they, as dieth the one, so, dieth the other, and, one spirit, have they all,and, the pre-eminence of man over beast, is nothing, for, all, were vanity:

20. all, go unto one place,all, came from the dust, and all, return to the dust.

21. Who knoweth the spirit of the sons of men, whether it, ascendeth, above,or the spirit of the beast, whether it, descendeth, below, to the earth?

22. So I saw, that there was nothing better than that a man should be glad in his works, for, that, is his portion,for who can bring him in, to look upon that which shall be after him?

## Ecclesiastes 4

1. Then again, I, considered all the oppressive deeds which were done under the sun,and lo! the tears of the oppressed, and they have no comforter, and, on the side of their oppressing, is power, and they have no comforter.

2. So, I, pronounced happy the dead, who were, already, dead,more than the living, who were living, still;

3. and, as better than both, him who had not yet come into being,who had not seen the vexatious work, which was done under the sun.

4. Then saw, I, all the toil and all the skill of the work, that, for this, a man was envied of his neighbour,even this, was vanity, and a feeding on wind.

5. The dullard, claspeth his hands, and consumeth his own flesh.

6. Better a handfulwith quietness,than both hands, fullwith toil, and feeding on wind.

7. Then again, I, looked at a vain thing under the sun:

8. Here is one, without a second, even son or brother, he hath none, yet is there no end to all his toil, even his eye, is not satisfied with riches,neither   For whom, am I toiling, and letting my soul want good? Even this, was vanity, yea a vexatious employment, it was!

9. Better are two, than one,in that they have a good reward for their toil.

10. For, if the one should fall,   would raise up his companion,but alas! for him who is alone when he falleth, with no second to raise him up!

11. Moreover, if two lie together, then have they warmth,but how can, one, have warmth?

12. And, though an enemy should prevail against one, two, might make a stand before him,and, a threefold cord, cannot soon be broken.

13. Better a boy poor and wise,than a king, old and stupid, who knoweth not how to take warning any longer.

14. For, out of prison, came he forth to reign, yea, even in his own kingdom, was he born poor.

15. I saw all the living, who were going hither and thither under the sun,  with the boy who was to be the second, who was to stand in the others place:

16. There was no end to all the people, to all before whom he came, yet, they who should come later, would not rejoice in him,surely, even this, was vanity, and a feeding on wind.

## Ecclesiastes 5

1. Keep thy foot, when thou goest unto the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than dullards to offer sacrifice,for they make no acknowledgment of doing wrong.

2. Be not rash with thy mouth, and, with thy heart, be not in haste to bring forth a word, before God,for, God, is in the heavens, and, thou, upon the earth, for this cause, let thy words be few.

3. For a dream cometh through the multitude of business,and, the voice of a dullard, is with a multitude of words.

4. When thou vowest a vow unto God, do not defer to pay it, for there is no pleasure in dullards,what thou vowest, pay!

5. Better that thou shouldest not vow,than vow, and not pay.

6. Do not let thy mouth cause thy flesh to sin,neither say thou, before the messenger, that it was, a mistake,wherefore should God be indignant at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?

7. For   amidst a multitude of dreams, and vanities, and many words,but, towards God, be thou reverent.

8. If, the oppression of the poor, and the wresting of justice and righteousness, thou see in the province, do not be astonished over the matter,for, one high above the highest, is watching, yea, the Most High, is over them.

9. And, the profit of the earth, is, for all,a king, by the field, is served.

10. He that loveth silver, shall not be satisfied with silver nor, he that loveth abundance, with revenue,-even this, was vanity.

11. When blessings are increased, increased are the eaters thereof,what profit, then, to the owner of them saving the sight of his eyes?

12. Sweet the sleep of the labourer, whether, little or much, he eat,but, the surfeit of the rich man, will not suffer him to sleep.

13. Here was an incurable evil, I had seen under the sun, riches kept by the owner thereof, to his hurt;

14. and those riches perish, by being ill employed,and though he begetteth a son, yet is there in his hand nothing at all.

15. As he came from his mothers womb, naked, he again departeth, as he came,and, nothing, can he take of his toil, which he can carry in his hand.

16. Even this, moreover, is an incurable evil, altogether as he came, so, shall he depart,what profit then shall he have who toileth for the wind?

17. Even all his days,

18. Lo! what, I myself, have seenBetter that it should be excellent to eat and to drink and to see blessedness, in all ones toil wherein one toileth under the sun, for the number of the days of his life, in that God hath given it him, for, that, is his portion:

19. yet, as regardeth every man, to whom God hath given wealth and goods, and granted him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to find gladness in his toil, this, is, the gift of God.

20. Though it be not much, let him remember the days of his life,for, God, beareth witness, by the gladness of his heart.

## Ecclesiastes 6

1. Here was an evil, I had seen under the sun,and it is, common, among men:

2. A man to whom God giveth riches and gains and honour, so that nothing doth he lack for his soulof all that he craveth, and yet God doth not give him power to eat thereof, but, a man unknown, eateth it,this, was vanity, and, an incurable evil, it was.

3. Though a man should beget a hundred children, and live, many years, so that many should be the days of his years but, his own soul, should not be satisfied with the good, and he should not even have, a burial, I said, Better than he, is an untimely birth!

4. For, in vain, it came in, and, in darkness, it departeth,and, with darkness, its name, is covered:

5. even the sun, it never saw, nor aught did it know,more quietness, hath this than the other.

6. Even though one hath lived a thousand years twice told, yet, good, hath he not seen,is it not, unto one place, that, all, are going?

7. All the toil of man, is for his mouth,though, even the desire, is not satisfied!

8. For what profit hath the wise man, over the dullard? What can, the poor man, knowso as to walk before the living?

9. Better what the eyes behold, than the wandering of desire,even this, was vanity, and a feeding on wind.

10. Whatsoever one may be, long ago, was he called by his name, and it is known that it isSon of Earth,he cannot, therefore, contend with one stronger than he.

11. Seeing there are things in abundance which make vanity abound, what profit hath man?

12. For who knoweth what is good for a man throughout his life, for the number of the days of his life of vanity, seeing he will make them, like a shadow,for who can tell a man, what shall be after him, under the sun?

## Ecclesiastes 7

1. Better a name, than precious ointment,and the day of death, than the day of ones birth.

2. Better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of banqueting, for, that, is the end of all men,and, the living, should take it to his heart.

3. Better is grief than laughter,for, by the marring of the face, amended is the heart.

4. The heart of the wise, is in the house of mourning, but, the heart of dullards, in the house of mirth.

5. Better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for any man to hear the song of dullards,

6. For, as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so, is the laughter of the dullard,even this, then, was vanity.

7. For, oppression, maddeneth the wise,and a bribe, destroyeth the understanding.

8. Better the latter end of a thing, than the beginning thereof,Better a patient spirit, than a haughty spirit.

9. Do not be rash in thy spirit, to be indignant,for, indignation, in the bosom of dullards, doth remain.

10. Do not say, What hath happened, that, the former days, were better than these? for, not wisely, askest thou concerning this.

11. Good is wisdom, with an inheritance,and a profit, to such as see the sun.

12. For, a protection, is wisdom, and, a protection, is silver,but, the advantage of knowledge, is, that, wisdom, giveth life to the possessors thereof.

13. Consider the work of God,for who can straighten what he hath bent?

14. In the day of prosperity, be joyful, but, in the day of misfortune, consider,Even the one equally with the other, hath God made, to the end man might find outafter himnothing.

15. Everything, had I seen, in my days of vanity,Here was a righteous man, perishing in his righteousness, and there was a lawless man, continuing long in his wickedness.

16. Do not become so very righteous, neither count thyself wise beyond measure,wherefore shouldst thou destroy thyself?

17. Do not be so very lawless, neither become thou foolish,wherefore shouldst thou die, before thy time?

18. It is well that thou shouldst lay fast hold of this, but, even from the other, do not withdraw thy hand,for, he that revereth God, shall come forth out of them all.

19. Wisdom, bringeth more strength to a wise man, than ten heroes, that are in the city.

20. For, as for men, there is none righteous in the earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.

21. Moreover, not to all the words which men speak, do thou apply thy heart,lest thou hear thine own servant reviling thee!

22. For truly, many times, thy heart knoweth,that, even thou thyself, hast reviled others.

23. All this, have I proved by wisdom,I said, I will be wise, but, that, was far from me.

24. Far away, is that which hath been,and deep, deep, who can find it out?

25. Resolved, I, in my heart, to know and search out, and to seek wisdom, and a conclusion,and to know lawlessness   stupidity, and folly to be madness.

26. I, could indeed find, to be, more bitter than death, the woman, whose heart is, snares and nets, and her hands, bonds,whoso is pleasing before God, shall escape from her, but, he that sinneth, shall be captured by her.

27. See! this, have I found, saith the Proclaimer   one by one, to find a conclusion;

28. what my soul still sought, yet I found not,one man out of a thousand, have I found, but, a woman among all these, have I not found.

29. Only, see, this, have I found, That God made man upright, but, they, have sought out many devices.

## Ecclesiastes 8

1. Who is really a wise man, and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? The wisdom of a man, lighteth up his countenance, but, by defiance of countenance, one is disfigured.

2. I   , The bidding of the king, observe thou, even out of regard to the oath of God.

3. Not rashly from his presence, shouldst thou go: do not take thy stand in a vexatious thing,for, whatsoever he pleaseth, he will do.

4. Where the word of a king is, there is power,who then may say to him, What wouldst thou do?

5. He that observeth the commandment, will not notice a vexatious thing,and, of time and manner, will the heart of the wise take note.

6. For, to every pursuit, there is a time and a manner,when, the vexation of man, is great concerning it.

7. For there is no one who knoweth what shall be, for, when it shall be, who will tell him?

8. No man, hath power over the spirit, to retain the spirit, and, none, hath power over the day of death, and there is no furlough in war,neither shall lawlessness deliver them who are given thereto.

9. All this, had I seen, and tried to apply my heart to every work which was done under the sun,at such time as one man had power over another man, to his hurt.

10. And, thereupon, I considered the lawless when buried, when they had entered,   , that, from the place of the Holy One, they used to go and boast in the city that they had so done,even this, was vanity.

11. Because sentence against a wicked work is not executed speedilyon this account, the heart of the sons of men is fully set within them, to commit wickedness.

12. Though a sinner be committing wickedness a hundred times, and continuing long in his own way, yet I surely know that it shall be well to them who revere God, who stand in awe before him;

13. but, well, shall it not be to the lawless man, neither shall he lengthen out his days like a shadow,because he standeth not in awe before God.

14. Here was a vain thing which was done upon the earththat there were righteous men unto whom it happened according to the work of the lawless, and there were lawless men, unto whom it happened according to the work of the righteous,I said, that, even this, was vanity.

15. Then extolled I, gladness, in that there was nothing better for a man, under the sun, than to eat and to drink, and to be glad,since, that, should tarry with him in his toil, for the days of his life which God had given him under the sun.

16. When I gave my heart, to know wisdom, and to consider the business that was done upon the earth, then surely, by day and by night, there was one who suffered not his eyes, to sleep.

17. Then I considered all the work of God, that man could not find out the work that was done under the sun, inasmuch as man toileth in seeking and yet cannot find,yea, even though the wise man should say he knoweth, yet can he not find it out.

## Ecclesiastes 9

1. For, unto all this, I applied my heart, and, my heart, considered all this, that, the righteous and the wise and their servants, were in the hand of God,neither love nor hatred, could any man know, every one, was before Him.

2. Every one, was like every one else, one destiny, had the righteous and the lawless, the good and the pure and the impure, and he that sacrificed, and he that did not sacrifice,as the good man, so, the sinner, he that took an oath, as he who, of an oath, stood in fear.

3. This was a misfortune in all that was done under the sun, that, one destiny, had they all,yea also, the heart of the sons of men, was full of wickedness, and, madness, was in their heart, while they lived, and, after that,

4. For, whosoever was united to all the living, for him, there was hope,-inasmuch as, a living dog, fared better than a dead lion.

5. For, the living, knew that they should die,-but, the dead, knew not, anything, neither had they any longer a reward, because forgotten was their memory.

6. Both their love and their hatred and their envy, already had perished,and, portion, had they none any longer, unto times age-abiding, in aught that was done under the sun.

7. Go thy wayeat, with gladness, thy food, and drink, with a happy heart, thy wine,when already God is well pleased with thy works.

8. Continually, let thy garments be white,and, ointment upon thy bead, let it not be lacking.

9. Enjoy life, with thy wife whom thou lovest, all the days of thy life of vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all thy days of vanity,for, that, is thy portion in life, and in thy toil wherewith, thou, art toiling under the sun.

10. Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, with thy might, do,for there is no work nor calculation nor knowledge nor wisdom, in hades, whither, thou, art going.

11. I again saw under the sun, that not, to the swift, was the race, nor, to the strong, the battle, nay! nor, to the wise, food, nor yet, to the intelligent, riches, nor, even to the well-informed, comeliness,for, time and accident, happened to them all.

12. For, indeed, man could not know his own time, like fishes which were caught in a cruel net, and like little birds which were caught in a trap,like them, were ensnared the sons of men, by a time of misfortune, when it fell upon them suddenly.

13. Even this, had I seen of wisdom, under the sun,and, of great import, was the same unto me:

14. A little city, and men therein few,and there came against it a great king, and surrounded it, and built against it large siege-works;

15. but there was found therein, a man, poor   wise, and, he, delivered the city by his wisdom,yet, no one, remembered that poor man.

16. Then said, I, Better is wisdom than strength,although, the wisdom of the poor man, be despised, and, his words, not heard.

17. The words of the wise, in quietness, are heard,beyond the outcry of one who ruleth over dullards.

18. Better is wisdom, than weapons of war,but, one sinner, may destroy much good.

## Ecclesiastes 10

1. Dead flies, cause to stink   ferment, the oil of the perfumer,More costly than wisdom or honour, is a little folly.

2. The sense of the wise, is on his right hand,But, the sense of the dullard, on his left:

3. Yea, even by the way, as the foolish man walketh along, his sense faileth himand he telleth everyone that, foolish, is he!

4. If, the spirit of a ruler, riseth up against thee, thy place, do not leave, for gentleness, pacifieth such as have greatly erred.

5. Here was a misfortune I had seen under the sun,a veritable mistake that was going forth from the presence of one who had power:

6. Folly placed in great dignity,while, the rich, in a low place, took their seat:

7. I had seen, servants, upon horses,and, rulers, walking like servants, on the ground.

8. He that diggeth a pit, thereinto, may fall,and, he that breaketh through a hedge, there may bite him a serpent.

9. He that removeth stones, may be hurt therewith,and he that cleaveth wood, may be endangered thereby.

10. If, blunt, be the iron, and, himself, hath not sharpened, the edge, then, much force, must he apply,but, an advantage for giving success, is wisdom.

11. If a serpent will bite, unless he is charmed, then there is nothing better for him that owneth a tongue.

12. The words of a wise mans mouth, are pleasant,but, the lips of a dullard, will swallow him up:

13. The beginning of the words of his mouth, is folly,but, the latter end of his speech, is mischievous madness.

14. Yet, a foolish man, multiplieth words,  no man knoweth that which hath been, and, that which shall be after him, who can tell him?

15. The toil of dullards, shall weary a man, that he knoweth not how to go into the city.

16. Alas! for thee, O land, when thy king is a boy,and, thy rulers, in the morning, do eat:

17. How happy art thou, O land, when thy king is a son of nobles,and, thy rulers, in season, do eat, for strength, and not for debauchery.

18. By two lazy arms, the framework sinketh in,and, by the hanging down of the hands, the house may leak.

19. Merrily people make bread, and, wine, gladdeneth life,but, money, answereth all things.

20. Even in thy thought, do not revile, the king, nor, within thy bed-chambers, revile thou the rich,for, a bird of the heavens, might carry the voice, yea, an owner of wings, might tell the matter.

## Ecclesiastes 11

1. Cast thy bread-corn, upon the face of the waters,for, after many days, shalt thou find it:

2. Give a portion to seven, yea even to eight,for thou canst not know, what there shall be of misfortune, upon the earth.

3. If the clouds be filled with a downpour, upon the earth, will they empty themselves, and, if a tree fall in the south or in the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there will it be found.

4. He that observeth the wind, will not sow,and, he that watcheth the clouds, will not reap.

5. Just as thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, when the body is in the womb of her that is with child, even, so, canst thou not know the work of God, who maketh all.

6. In the morning, sow thy seed, and, until evening, do not withhold thy hand,for thou knowest notwhether shall thrive, either this or that, or whether, both alike, shall be fruitful.

7. Truly sweet is the light,and, pleasant to the eyes, to see the sun:

8. But, though, many years, a man live, through them all, let him rejoice; yet let him remember the days of darkness, for many they may be, all that cometh, may be vanity.

9. Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart gladden thee in the days of thine early manhood, and walk thouin the ways of thine own heart, and in that which is seen by thine own eyes,yet know, that, for all these things, will God bring thee into judgment.

10. Therefore remove thou vexation from thy heart, and put away discomfort from thy flesh,for, youth and dawn, are vanity!

## Ecclesiastes 12

1. Yet remember thy Creator, in the days of thy vigour,or ever come in, the days of discomfort, and the years arrive, in which thou shalt sayI have, in them, no pleasure;

2. Or ever be darkenedthe sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars,and the clouds return after a downpour of rain;

3. In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the men of might bow themselves,and the grinders cease because they are few, and they who look through the windows are darkened;

4. And the doors in the street be closed, when the sound of the mill become low,and one rise at the chirp of a small bird, and low-voiced be all the daughters of song;

5. Yea, at what is high, they be in fear, and there be, terrors, in the way, and the almond be rejected, and the grasshopper drag itself along, and desire perish,for man is going to his age-abiding home, when the wailers shall go round in the streets;

6. Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken,or the bucket by the fountain be shivered, or the wheel at the well be broken;

7. And the dust return to the earth, as it was,and, the spirit, return unto God, who gave it.

8. Vanity of vanities, saith the Proclaimer, all, is vanity.

9. Besides that, the Proclaimer being wise,still further taught knowledge unto the people, and weighed and searched, arranged proverbs in abundance.

10. The Proclaimer sought to find out words giving delight, and to note down rightly, the words of truth.

11. The words of the wise, are as goads, yea, as driven nails, their well-ordered sayings,given from one shepherd.

12. And besides, from them, my son, be admonished,Of making many books, there is no end, and, much study, is a weariness of the flesh.

13. The conclusion of the matterthe whole, let us hear,Towards God, be reverent, and, his commandments, observe, for, this,   all mankind.

14. For, every work, will God bring into judgment, with every hidden thing,whether good, or evil.
