## Titus 1

__In order that, ready, may be the man, of God, unto every good work, being well-prepared.__

1. Paul, a servant of Godan apostle moreover of Jesus Christ,according to the faith of the chosen ones of God, and the personal knowledge of the truth that is according to godliness,

2. In hope of life age-abiding; which God, who cannot lie, promised before age-during times,

3. but hath manifested in its fitting seasons, even his word, in the proclamation with which entrusted am Iby injunction of our Saviour God:

4. Unto Titus, my true child according to a common faith,favour and peace, from God

5. For this cause left I thee in Crete, that, the things remaining undone, thou mightest completely set in order, and mightest establish, in every city, elders, as, I, with thee arranged:

6. If anyone is unaccusable, a husband of, one wife, having children that believe, who are not charged with riotous excess, nor insubordinate;

7. For it is needful that the overseer beunaccusable, as Gods steward, not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, not ready to wound, not seeking gain by base means,

8. But hospitable, a lover of what is good, sober-minded, just, kind, possessing self-control,

9. Holding fast, in the matter of his teaching, the faithful word, that he may be able both to encourage with his healthful instruction, and, the gainsayers, to refute.

10. For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially they of the circumcision,

11. Whose mouths must needs be stopped, men who are upsetting whole houses, teaching the things which ought not   for the sake of base gain.

12. Said one from among them, a prophet, of their own!Cretans! always false, mischievous wild-beasts, idle gluttons:

13. This witness, is true,for which cause, be reproving them sharply, that they may be healthy in their faith,

14. Not giving heed to Judaical stories and commandments of men who are turning away from the truth:

15. All things, are pure, unto the pure, but, unto the polluted and faithless, nothing, is pure, but polluted are both their mind and conscience;

16. God, they confess that they know, but, by their works, they deny him, being, abominable, and obdurate, and, as to any good work, found, worthless.

## Titus 2

1. But do, thou, speak the things which become the healthful instruction:

2. That, aged men, be, sober, grave, sober-minded, healthy in their faith, love, endurance;

3. Aged women, in the same way, in deportment, as becometh sacred persons, not given to intrigue, nor yet, to much wine, enslaved, teachers of virtue,

4. That they may constrain the young women to be, lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children,

5. soberminded, chaste, workers at home, good, submitting themselves to their own husbands,that, the word of God, be not defamed;

6. The younger men, in the same way, exhort thou to be sober-minded:

7. In all things, shewing, thyself, an ensample of noble works,in thine instruction, uncorruptness, gravity,

8. healthful discourse that cannot be condemned, in order that, he that is of the contrary part, may relent, having nothing to say concerning us that is disparaging:

9. Servants, unto their own masters, to be submitting themselves in all things, to be, well-pleasing, not gainsaying,

10. not taking anything away, shewing, all good faith,that, the instruction which is of our Saviour God, they may adorn in all things.

11. For the favour of God, bringing salvation for all men, hath shone forth,

12. Putting us under disciplinein order that,denying ourselves of ungodliness and worldly covetings, in a soberminded and righteous and godly manner, we should live, in the present age,

13. Prepared to welcome the happy hope and forthshining of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Christ Jesus,

14. Who gave himself up in our behalf, that he might redeem us from all manner of lawlessness, and purify for himself a people as his own treasurezealous of noble works.

15. As to these things, be speaking and exhorting and reproving, with all manner of precept: let, no one, disregard thee!

## Titus 3

1. Be putting them in mind, unto rulerships, unto authorities, to be in submission, to be yielding to rule, for every good work, to be, prepared,

2. To be defaming, no one, to be, averse to strife, considerate, shewing, all, meekness unto all men.

3. For, even we, used, at one time, to bethoughtless, unyielding, deceived, in servitude unto manifold covetings and pleasures, in malice and envy, leading on, detestable, hating one another.

4. But, when, the graciousness and affection for man of our Saviour God, shone forth,

5. Not by works which we had done in righteousness, but, according to his mercy, he saved usthrough means of the bathing of a new birth, and the moulding anew of Holy Spirit.

6. Which he poured on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour,

7. In order that, having been declared righteous by his favour, we should be made inheritors, according to hope, of life age-abiding.

8. Faithful, the saying! And, concerning these things, I am minded that thou be strongly affirming, in order that they who have believed God may be careful to be forward, in noble works. These things, are honourable, and profitable unto men;

9. But, foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strife, and contentions about matters of law, avoid, for they are unprofitable and vain.

10. From a party-man, after a first and second admonition, excuse thyself;

11. Knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.

12. As soon as I shall send Artemus unto thee, or Tychicus, give diligence to come to me unto Nicopolis; for, there, have I determined to winter.

13. Zenas the lawyer, and Apollos, do thou diligently set forward on their way, in order that, nothing, unto them, may be wanting.

14. Moreover, let our own learn to be forward, in honourable works, for the necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.

15. All they who are with me salute thee. Salute thou them who regard us with faithful affection. Favour, be with you all.
