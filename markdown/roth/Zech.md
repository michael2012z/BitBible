## Zechariah 1

__on the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month,in the second year of Darius the king.__

1. In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Yahweh unto Zechariah, son of Berechiah, son of Iddo, the prophet, saying:

2. Yahweh, was sore displeased, with your fathers:

3. therefore shalt thou say unto them, Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, Return ye unto me, urgeth Yahweh of hosts,that I may return unto you, saith Yahweh of hosts.

4. Do not become like your fathers, unto whom the former prophets, proclaimed, saying, Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, Return, I pray you, from your wicked ways, and from your wicked practices; but they heard not, nor hearkened unto me, declareth Yahweh.

5. Your fathers, where are they? and, the prophets, to times age-abiding, do they live?

6. Howbeit, as for my words and my statutes with which I charged my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? and so they returned and said, Just as Yahweh of hosts planned to do unto us, according to our ways and according to our practices, So hath he dealt with us?

7. Upon the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the same, is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Yahweh unto Zechariah, son of Berechiah, son of Iddo, the prophet, as followeth:

8. I looked by night, And lo! a man riding upon a red horse, and he was standing among the myrtle trees, in the shade; and, after him, were horses, red, bay, and white.

9. Then said I, What are these, my lord? And the messenger who was speaking with me, said unto me, I, will shew thee what these, are.

10. So the man who was standing among the myrtle-trees responded, and said,These, are they whom Yahweh, hath sent, to go to and fro through the earth.

11. Then responded they to the messenger of Yahweh, who was standing among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have gone to and fro through the earth,and lo! all the earth, resteth and is quiet.

12. Then the messenger of Yahweh responded, and said, O Yahweh of hosts! How long wilt, thou, not have compassion upon Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah,against which thou hast had indignation these seventy years?

13. And Yahweh answered the messenger who was speaking with me, in words that were pleasant,words that were consoling,

14. Then the messenger who was speaking with me, said unto me, Proclaim thou, saying, Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, I am jealous for Jerusalem, and for Zion, with a great jealousy;

15. And, with a great displeasure, am I displeased with the careless nations,in that, when, I, was displeased (for) a little, then, they, helped forward the calamity,

16. Wherefore, Thus, saith Yahweh, I have returned to Jerusalem, with compassions,, My house, shall be built therein, declareth Yahweh of hosts, and, a line, shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem.

17. Further, proclaim thou, saying, Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, Yet, shall my cities overflow with blessing! So will Yahweh yet, have compassion, upon Zion, and yet make choice of Jerusalem.

18. Then lifted I up mine eyes and looked,and lo! Four Horns.

19. And I said unto the messenger who was speaking with me, What are these? And he said unto me, These, are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.

20. Then Yahweh shewed me Four Craftsmen.

21. And I said, What are these coming in to do? And he spake, saying, These, are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head, but these

## Zechariah 2

1. Then lifted I up mine eyes and looked, and lo! a Man,and, in his hand, a Measuring Line.

2. And I said, Whither art thou going? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what   the breadth thereof, and what the length thereof.

3. And lo! the messenger who was talking with me, coming forward,and another messenger, coming forward to meet him.

4. So he said unto him, Run, speak unto this young man, saying: Like open villages, shall Jerusalem remain, for the multitude of men and cattle in her midst;

5. And, I, will become to her, declareth Yahweh, A wall of fire round about,and, a glory, will I become in her midst.

6. Ho! ho! flee ye, therefore, out of the land of the North, urgeth Yahweh. For, as the four winds of the heavens, have I spread you abroad, declareth Yahweh.

7. Ho! Zion, deliver thyself,thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon. For,

8. Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, For his own honour, hath he sent me unto the nations that are spoiling you,Surely, he that toucheth you, toucheth the pupil of mine eye.

9. For behold me! brandishing my hand over them, and they shall become a spoil unto their own slaves,and ye shall know that, Yahweh of hosts, hath sent me.

10. Sing out and rejoice, O daughter of Zion,For behold me! coming in, and I will make my habitation in thy midst, declareth Yahweh.

11. Then shall many nations, join themselves, unto Yahweh, in that day, and shall become my people,and I will make my habitation in thy midst, so shalt thou know that, Yahweh of hosts, hath sent me unto thee.

12. Thus will Yahweh inherit Judah, his portion, on the soil of the sanctuary,and make choice, yet again, of Jerusalem.

13. Hush! all flesh, before Yahweh,For he hath roused himself up out of his holy dwelling.

## Zechariah 3

1. And he shewed me, Joshua the high priest, standing before the messenger of Yahweh,and, the Accuser, standing at his right hand, to accuse him.

2. Then said Yahweh unto the Accuser, Yahweh rebuke thee, O Accuser, Yea Yahweh rebuke thee, he who is choosing Jerusalem,Is not, this, a brand snatched out of the fire?

3. Now, Joshua, was clothed with filthy garments,though standing before the messenger.

4. Then responded he and spake unto those who were standing before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from off him; and he said unto him, See! I have caused to pass from off thee, thine iniquity, And will cause thee to be clothed in robes of state.

5. Then said I, Let them put a clean turban upon his head,So they put the clean turban upon his head, and clothed him with garments, and, the messenger of Yahweh, was standing up.

6. So then the messenger of Yahweh did solemnly affirm unto Joshua, saying:

7. Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, If, in my ways, thou wilt walk, and if, of my charge, thou wilt keep charge, Then, even thou, shalt govern my house, Moreover also, thou shalt have charge of my courts,and I will give thee free access among these who stand by.

8. Hear, I pray thee, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy friends who are sitting before thee, for, men to serve as signs, they are,For behold me! bringing in my servant, the Bud;

9. For lo! the stone which I have set before Joshua, Upon one stone, are Seven (pairs of) Eyes,Behold me! cutting the engraving thereof, declareth Yahweh of hosts. So will I take away the iniquity of that land in one day.

10. In that day, declareth Yahweh of hosts, Ye shall invite one another,

## Zechariah 4

1. And once more the messenger who was speaking with me, roused me up, just as a man might be roused up out of his sleep.

2. Then said he unto me, What canst thou see? And I saidI have looked, and lo! a Lampstandall of gold, with the Bowl thereof upon the top thereof, and its Seven Lamps upon it, Seven Pipes each, to the lamps which are upon the top thereof;

3. and, Two Olive-trees, by it,one upon the right hand of the bowl, and one upon the left hand thereof.

4. Then responded I, and said unto the messenger who was speaking with me, saying,What are these, my lord?

5. Then answered the messenger who was speaking with me, and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these, are? And I said, No my lord.

6. Then responded he, and spake unto me, saying, This, is the word of Yahweh, unto Zerubbabel, saying,Not by wealth, nor by strength, but by my spirit, saith Yahweh of hosts.

7. Who, art, thou, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel,   to a plain! So shall he bring forth the headstone, with thundering shouts Beautiful! Beautiful! thereunto.

8. Then came the word of Yahweh unto me, saying:

9. The hands of Zerubbabel, have founded this house, and, his hands, shall finish it,So shalt thou know that, Yahweh of hosts, hath sent me unto you.

10. For who hath despised the day of small things? Yet shall they rejoice, when they see the plummet-stone in the hand of Zerubbabel,these seven! The eyes of Yahweh, they arerunning to and fro throughout all the earth.

11. Then responded I, and said unto him,What are these two olive-trees, upon the right of the lampstand, and upon the left thereof?

12. And I responded a second time, and said unto him,What are the two branches of the olive- trees which join the two golden tubes, which empty out of them the golden oil?

13. And he spake unto me, saying, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.

14. Then said he, These, are the two Anointed Ones,who stand near the Lord of all the earth.

## Zechariah 5

1. And once more lifted I mine eyes, and looked,and lo! a Flying Volume.

2. And he said unto me, What canst thou see? So I said, I, can see a flying volume, the length thereof, twenty by the cubit, and, the breadth thereof, ten by the cubit.

3. Then said he unto me, This, is the curse, which is going forth over the face of all the earth,Because, every one who stealeth, on the one side, hath in one way been let off, and, every one who sweareth, on the other side, hath in another way been let off,

4. fehlt

5. Then came forward, the messenger who was talking with me,and said unto meLift up, I pray thee, thine eyes, and see what this is which is coming forth.

6. And I said, What is it? Then said he, This, is an ephah that is coming forth. And he said, This, is their iniquity, throughout all the land.

7. And lo! a leaden disc uplifted,and here a certain woman, sitting inside the ephah.

8. Then said he, This, is Lawlessness. So he thrust her back inside the ephah,and then thrust the leaden weight into the mouth thereof.

9. Then lifted I up mine eyes and looked, and lo! Two Women coming forward, with the wind in their wings, and, they, had wings, like the wings of the stork,and bare up the ephah, between the earth and the heavens.

10. Then said I unto the messenger who was speaking with me,Whither are they carrying the ephah?

11. And he said unto me, To build for it a house in the land of Shinar,so shall it be ready, and they shall settle it there, upon its own base?

## Zechariah 6

1. And once again I lifted mine eyes, and looked, and lo! four chariots, coming forward from between two mountains,now, the mountains, were mountains of copper.

2. In the first chariot, were red horses,and, in the second chariot, black horses;

3. and, in the third chariot, white horses,and, in the fourth chariot, horses spotted, deep red.

4. Then began I, and said, unto the messenger who was speaking with me,What are these, my lord?

5. And the messenger answered, and said unto me,These, are the four winds of the heavens, coming forward after each hath presented itself near the Lord of all the earth.

6. They in whose chariot are the black horses, are going forth into the land of the North, and, the white, have gone forth after them,and, the spotted, have gone forth into the land of the South;

7. and, the deep red, have come forward and sought to go their way, that they might journey to and fro in the land, so he said, Go your way, journey to and fro in the land,and they journeyed to and fro in the land.

8. Then made he outcry beside me, and spake unto me, saying,See, these who are going forth into the land of the North, have settled my spirit in the land of the North.

9. Then came the word of Yahweh unto me, saying:

10. Take of them of the exile, of Heldai, and of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah,then shalt, thou thyself, enter, on that day, yea thou shalt enter the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah,   who have come in out of Babylon;

11. yea thou shalt take silver and gold, and make a crown,and set   upon the head of Jehoshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest;

12. then shalt thou speak unto him, saying, Thus, speaketh Yahweh of hosts, saying,Lo! a man! Bud, is his name, and, out of his own place, shall he bud forth, and shall build the temple of Yahweh;

13. Yea, he, shall build the temple of Yahweh, and, he, shall bear the honour, and shall sit and rule upon his throne,and shall become a priest upon his throne, and, the counsel of peace, shall be between the two of them.

14. But, the crown, shall belong to Heldai and to Tobiah and to Jedaiah, and to Hen son of Zephaniah,for a memorial in the temple of Yahweh.

15. And, they who are afar off, shall come in and shall build at the temple of Yahweh, so shall yea know that, Yahweh of hosts, hath sent me unto you,and it shall come to pass if ye will, indeed hearken, unto the voice of Yahweh your God.

## Zechariah 7

1. And it came to pass, in the fourth year of Darius the king, that the word of Yahweh came unto Zechariah, on the fourth of the ninth month, in Chisleu;

2. yea when Bethel sent Sherezer and Regemmelech, and his men,to pacify the face of Yahweh:

3. to speak unto the priests that pertained to the house of Yahweh of hosts, and unto the prophets, saying,Shall I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?

4. Then came the word of Yahweh of hosts unto me, saying:

5. Speak thou unto all the people of the land, and unto the priests, saying,When ye fasted and lamented in the fifth and in the seventh, even these seventy years, did ye, really fast, unto, me?

6. And, when ye used to eat and when ye used to drink, was it not, of your own accord, ye did eat, and, of your own accord, ye did drink?

7. Should ye not

8. And the word of Yahweh came unto Zechariah, saying:

9. Thus, spake Yahweh of hosts, saying,With true justice, give ye judgment, and, lovingkindness and compassions, observe ye, one with another;

10. And, the widow and the fatherless, the sojourner and the humbled, do not ye oppress,and, wickedness between one man and another, do not ye devise in your hearts.

11. Howbeit they refused to give heed, but put forth a rebellious shoulder,and, their ears, made they hard of hearing, that they might not hear;

12. and, their heart, turned they into adamant, that they might not hear the law, nor the words which Yahweh of hosts sent by his spirit, through the former prophets,and so there came great wrath from Yahweh of hosts.

13. Therefore came it to pass thatjust as he cried out and they hearkened not, so, used they to cry out, and I used not to hearken, saith Yahweh of hosts;

14. But I whirled them over all the nations whom they had not known, and, the land, was made desolate after them, that none passed through and returned,Yea they made of a delightful landa desolation.

## Zechariah 8

1. And the word of Yahweh of hosts came, saying:

2. Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, I am jealous for Zion with a great jealousy,Yea, with great wrath, am I jealous for her.

3. Thus, saith Yahweh, I have returned unto Zion, and will make my habitation in the midst of Jerusalem,and Jerusalem, shall be called, The city of fidelity, and the mountain of Yahweh of hosts, The mountain of holiness.

4. Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, Yet shall old men and old women sit in the broadways of Jerusalem,Yea, each one with his staff in his hand for multitude of days:

5. And, the broadways of the city, shall be full of boys and girls,playing in the broadways thereof.

6. Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, Because it will be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people, in those days, In mine own eyes also, shall it be marvellous? Demandeth Yahweh of hosts.

7. Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, Behold me! saving my people out of the land of the dawn,and out of the land of the going in of the sun;

8. And I will bring them in, and they shall have their habitation in the midst of Jerusalem,and shall become my people, and, I, will become their God, In faithfulness and in righteousness.

9. Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, Let your hands be strong, ye who are hearing, in these days, these words,from the mouth of the prophets who, on the day the house of Yahweh of hosts, was founded,   that, the temple, should be built:

10. That, before those days, hire for man, could not be obtained, and, hire for beast, was there none,and, neither to him who went out nor to him who came in, was there success by reason of the danger, Yea I let all men loose, each one against his neighbour.

11. But, now, not as in the former days, am I to this remnant of the people,Declareth Yahweh of hosts;

12. For, the seed, shall be securethe vine, shall yield her fruit, and the land, yield her increase, and the heavens, yield their dew,and I will cause this remnant of the people to inherit all these things.

13. And it shall come to pass thatJust as ye had become a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, So, will I save you, and ye shall become a blessing,Do not fear, let your hands, be strong.

14. For, thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, Just as I planned to bring calamity upon you, when your fathers provoked me, saith Yahweh of hosts,and I relented not,

15. So, have I again planned, in these days, to do good unto Jerusalem, and unto the house of Judah,Do not fear!

16. These, are the things which ye shall do: Speak ye the truth, every man with his neighbour, truth and the sentence of peace, pronounce ye in your gates;

17. And let, no man, devise, the injury of his neighbour, in your heart, and the oath of falsehood, do not love,for, all these, are things which I hate, declareth Yahweh.

18. And the word of Yahweh of hosts came unto me, saying:

19. Thus, saith Yahweh of hostsThe fast of the fourth, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the eleventh, shall become to the house of Judah a gladness and a rejoicing, and pleasant appointed meetings,But, truth and peace, see that ye love.

20. Thus, saith Yahweh of hoses,It shall yet be that there shall come in peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities;

21. And the inhabitants of one city, shall go, unto them of another, saying, Let us be going on to pacify the face of Yahweh, and to seek Yahweh of hosts,I also, will go!

22. So shall enter many peoples, and strong nations, to seek Yahweh of hosts in Jerusalem,and to pacify the face of Yahweh.

23. Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, In those days,

## Zechariah 9

1. The oracle of the word of Yahweh on the land of Hadrach, and, Damascus, shall be the resting-place thereof,For, Yahweh, hath an eyeto mankind, and to all the tribes of Israel;

2. Moreover also, Hamath, adjoineth thereto, Tyre and Zidon,because very wise;

3. Therefore did Tyre build a stronghold for herself,and did heap up silver like dust, yea gold, like the mire of the lanes.

4. Lo! My Lord, shall dispossess her, and smite, into the sea, her fortress,and, she herself, in fire, shall be consumed.

5. Ashkelon, shall see, and fear, Gaza, also, which shall writhe in great anguish, Ekron, also, because abashed is her expectation,and the king, shall perish, from Gaza, and, Ashkelon, not be inhabited;

6. And there shall be seated a half-breed in Ashdod,So will I cut off the arrogance of the Philistines;

7. And will take away his reeking prey out of his mouth, and his abominations, from between his teeth, but, he that is left, even he, shall belong to our God,So shall he become as a chief in Judah, and, Ekron, as a Jebusite!

8. Then will I encamp about my houseagainst an army, against him that passeth by, and against him that returneth, neither shall an exactor, tread them down any more,for, now, have I seen with mine own eyes.

9. Exult greatly, O daughter of Zion, Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem, Lo! thy king, cometh unto thee, vindicated and victorious, is he,lowly, and riding upon an ass, yea, upon a colt, a young ass.

10. So will he cut off the chariot out of Ephraim, and the horse out of Jerusalem, and the war-bow, shall be cut off, So shall he speak peace to the nations, and, his dominion, shall be from sea to sea, and from the river    to the ends of the earth.

11. As for thee also,By the blood of thy covenant, have I sent forth thy prisoners out of a pit, wherein is no water.

12. Return to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope,Even to-day, do I declareDouble, will I return to thee!

13. For I have bent for meJudah, As a bow, have I grasped Ephraim, Thus will I rouse up thy sons, O Zion, against the sons of Greece, and will make thee as the sword of a mighty one.

14. But, Yahweh, over them, will appear, and forth shall go, as lightning, his arrow,Yea, My Lord Yahweh, with a horn, will blow, and will move along in the whirlwinds of the south.

15. Yahweh of hosts, will throw a covering over them, so shall they eat, and trample underfoot sling-stones, and shall drinkshall shout as with wine,and shall be filled like tossing-bowls,like the corners of an altar.

16. So will Yahweh their God, save them, on that day. yea, as a flock of sheep, his people,for   the jewels of a diadem sparkling over his land.

17. For how excellent it is! Yea how beautiful! Corn, shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the maidens.

## Zechariah 10

1. Ask ye from Yahweh rain, in the time of the latter rain, Yahweh, who causeth flashes of lightning,and, rain in abundant showers, giveth he unto them, to every man, herbage in the field;

2. For, the household gods, have spoken vanity, and, the diviners, have had vision of falsehood, and, deceitful dreams, do they relate, vainly, do they console,for this reason, have they moved about like a flock, they suffer ill, because there is no shepherd.

3. Against the shepherds, is kindled mine anger, and, upon the leaders of the flock, will I bring punishment,for Yahweh of hosts hath visited his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them like his noble horse in battle:

4. From him, the commander, from him, the supporter, from him, the war-bow,from him, shall proceed every one that driveth on, together;

5. So shall they become like mighty ones, trampling on the mire of lanes, in battle, and they will fight because, Yahweh, is with them,and will abash the riders of horses.

6. So will I make mighty ones of the house of Judah, and, the house of Joseph, will I save, and will cause them to continue, because I have had compassion upon them, So shall they be as though I had not rejected them,for, I, Yahweh, will be their God, and will answer them;

7. And they shall be as the mighty one of Ephraim, and their heart, shall rejoice, as through wine,yea, their children, shall see and rejoice, their heart, shall exult, in Yahweh.

8. I will signal for them, and will gather them, because I have ransomed them,and they shall multiply, according as they have multiplied;

9. Though I scatter them among the peoples, yet, in places far away, shall they remember me,and they shall live with their children, and shall return;

10. And I will bring them back out of the land of Egypt, and, out of Assyria, will I gather them,and, into the land of Gilead and Lebanon, will I bring them, and   shall not be found for them:

11. Though he pass through a sea of affliction, yet shall he smite the sea, with its waves, and the roaring depths of the Nile, shall appear dry,So shall be brought down the pride of Assyria, and, the sceptre of Egypt, shall depart;

12. And I will make them mighty in Yahweh, and, in his name, shall they march to and fro,Declareth Yahweh.

## Zechariah 11

1. Open, O Lebanon, thy doors,that a fire, may devour, thy cedar,

2. Howl, fir-tree, for fallen is the cedar, because, the majestic ones, are spoiled: howl, ye oaks of Bashan, for the inaccessible forest, hath come down.

3. The noise of the howling of the shepherds, for spoiled is their majesty,The noise of the roaring of the young lions, for spoiled are the proud banks of the Jordan.

4. Thus, saith Yahweh my God,Tend thou the flock doomed to slaughter:

5. Whose, buyers, slay them, and are not held guilty, and whose, sellers, sayBlessed be Yahweh, that I am become rich, And so, their own shepherds, have no pity upon them.

6. Surely I will have pity no longer upon the inhabitants of the earth, Declareth Yahweh,Therefore lo! I am delivering up mankind, every man into the hand of his neighbour, and into the hand of his king, and they will crush the earth, nor will I deliver out of their hand.

7. So I tended the flock doomed to slaughter, for the sheep-merchants,and took unto me two staves, the one, I called Grace, and, the other, I called Union, thus I tended the sheep,

8. And I sent off three shepherds, in one month,for impatient was my soul with them, moreover also, their soul, felt a loathing against me.

9. Then said Il will not tend you,the dying, may die, and, the disappearing, may disappear, and, the remainder, may devour one another.

10. So I took my staff Grace, and cut it in two,that I might set aside my covenant which I had solemnised with all the peoples.

11. When it was broken, on that day, then did the sheep- merchants who were watching me, know, that, the word of Yahweh, it was.

12. Then said I unto them, If it be good in your eyes, give me my wage, and, if not, forbear. So they weighed out my wage, thirty pieces of silver.

13. Then said Yahweh unto me, Cast it into the treasury, the magnificent price at which I had been valued by them! So I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them, in the house of Yahweh, into the treasury.

14. Then cut I in two my second staff, even Union,that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.

15. Then said Yahweh unto me,Yet further take thee the implements of a worthless shepherd.

16. For lo! I am raising up a shepherd in the land, the disappearing, will he not visit, the straying, will he not seek, and, the fractured, will he not bind up,the weak, will he not nourish, but, the flesh of the fat, will he eat, and, their hoofs, will he break in pieces.

17. Alas! for my worthless shepherd, who forsaketh the flock, A sword upon his arm, and upon his right eye!his arm, shall be, utterly withered, and, his right eye, shall be, wholly darkened.

## Zechariah 12

1. The oracle of the word of Yahweh, on Israel,Declareth YahwehStretching out the heavens, and founding the earth, and fashioning the spirit of man within him:

2. Lo! I am making Jerusalem a bowl of reeling to all the peoples, round about,Moreover also, on Judah, shall it be in the siege against Jerusalem;

3. And it shall come to pass, in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a lifting-stone, to all the peoples, all who seek to lift her, shall, cut themselves in pieces,though all the nations of the earth, gather themselves together against her.

4. In that day, Declareth Yahweh, I will smite every horse with terror, and his rider with madness,and, over the house of Judah, will I keep opening mine eyes, and, every horse of the peoples, will I smite with blindness.

5. Then will the chiefs of Judah say in their hearts,A strength unto me,   the inhabitants of Jerusalem, in Yahweh of hosts, their God.

6. In that day, will I make the chiefs of Judah like a pan of fire among sticks, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf, so shall they devour, on the right hand and on the left, all the peoples round about; so shall Jerusalem yet, be inhabited, in her own place, as Jerusalem.

7. But Yahweh will save the tents of Judah first,lest the honour of the house of David, and the honour of the inhabitant of Jerusalem, should be magnified over Judah.

8. In that day, will Yahweh, throw a covering, around the inhabitant of Jerusalem, so shall the tottering among them, in that day, become like David,and the house of Davidlike God, like the messenger of Yahweh, before them.

9. And it shall come to pass, in that day,That I will seek to destroy all the nations, that come against Jerusalem.

10. But I will pour out upon the house of David and upon the inhabitant of Jerusalem, the spirit of favour, and of supplications, and they will look unto me, whom they have pierced,and will wail over him, as one waileth over an only son, and will make bitter outcry over him, as one maketh bitter outcry over a firstborn.

11. In that day, will the wailing, be great, in Jerusalem, as the wailing of Hadadrimmon, in the valley of Megiddon;

12. So shall the land, wail, family by family, apart,the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart, the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;

13. The family of the house of Levi, apart, and their wives apart, the family of Shimei, apart,and their wives apart:

14. All the families that remain, family by family, apart,and their wives, apart.

## Zechariah 13

1. In that day, there shall be an opened fountain, for the house of David, and for the Inhabitants of Jerusalem,for sin and for uncleanness.

2. And it shall come to pass, in that day, declareth Yahweh of hosts, That I will cut off the names of idols out of the land, and they shall not be remembered any more,Moreover also, even the prophets and the spirit of impurity, will I cause to pass away out of the land.

3. So shall it come about that, when any man shall prophesy again, then will his own father and his own mother, of whom he was born, say unto him,Thou shalt not live! For falsehood hast thou spoken in the name of Yahweh,So will his own father and his own mother of whom he was born, pierce him through, when he prophesieth,

4. Yea it shall come to pass, in that day, that the prophets, will turn pale, every man by reason of his vision when he prophesieth,neither will they put on a mantle of hair to deceive.

5. But he will say, No prophet, am I,One tilling the ground, am I, for, one of the common people, hath owned me from my youth.

6. Then will one say unto him, What are these wounds between thy hands? And he will say, Wherewith I was wounded in the house of them who loved me.

7. O Sword! awake against my shepherd, even against the man that is my companion, urgeth Yahweh of hosts,Smite the shepherd, and let the flock, be scattered, Howbeit I will turn back my hand over the little ones.

8. And it shall come to pass, in all the land, declareth Yahweh, Two-thirds therein, shall be cut off, and expire,but, a third, shall be left therein;

9. And I will bring the third into the fire, and will smelt them as one smelteth silver, and will try them, as one trieth gold,It, will call upon my name, and, I, will answer it, and will say, My people, it is! and, it, will say, Yahweh, is my God!

## Zechariah 14

1. Lo! a day, cometh, pertaining to Yahweh,when apportioned shall be thy spoil in thy midst;

2. Yea I will gather together all the nations unto Jerusalem, to battle, and the city, shall be captured, and the houses, plundered, and, the women, ravished,and half of the city, shall go forth, into exile, but, the remainder of the people, shall not be cut off out of the city.

3. Then will Yahweh go forth, and fight against those nations,just as he did in the day when he fought, in the day of battle;

4. Yea his feet, shall stand, in that day, on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the Mount of Olives, shall cleave asunder, from the midst thereof, towards the east and towards the west, an exceeding great valley,and half of the mountain, shall give way, toward the north, and half of it toward the south.

5. Then shall ye flee to the valley of my mountains, for the valley of the mountains, shall reach, very near, Yea, ye shall flee, just as ye fled from before the earthquake, in the days of Uzziah king of Judah,Then, shall arrive, Yahweh my God, All thy holy ones, with thee!

6. And it shall come to pass, in that day,that there shall be no light, the bright stars, shall be withdrawn;

7. And it shall be a day by itself, The same, shall be known unto YahwehNot day, nor night,But it shall come to pass, that, at evening time, there shall be light.

8. And it shall come to pass, in that day, that there shall go forth living waters out of Jerusalem, half of them unto the sea before, and half of them unto the sea behind, in summer and in winter, shall it he.

9. So will Yahweh become king over all the earth,In that day, shall there be one Yahweh, and, his Name, be one.

10. All the land shall turn into a plain, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem,and shall lift herself on high and abide in her own place, from the gate of Benjamin up to the place of the first gate, up to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel up to the wine-presses of the king.

11. So shall men dwell therein, and, utter destruction, shall not be any more,but Jerusalem, shall abide, in security.

12. And, this, shall be the plague wherewith Yahweh will plague all the peoples who have made war against Jerusalem,his flesh, shall be made to rot, while he is standing upon his feet, and, his eyes, shall rot in their sockets, and, his tongue, shall rot in their mouth;

13. And it shall come to pass, in that day, that there shall be a great confusion from Yahweh among them,and they will lay hold every one upon the hand of his neighbour, and his hand, will rise up, against the hand of his neighbour;

14. Moreover also, Judah, will fight with Jerusalem,and the wealth of all the nations round about, shall be gathered together, gold and silver and apparel, in great abundance.

15. And, so, shall be the plague of the horse, the mule, the camel, and the ass, and all the beasts which shall be in those camps,like this plague!

16. And it shall come to pass, that, as for every one that is left out of all the nations that came against Jerusalem, that they shall come up, from year to year, to bow down to the king, Yahweh of hosts, and to celebrate the festival of booths.

17. And it shall come to pass thatwhoso shall not come up out of the families of the earth unto Jerusalem, to bow down to the king, Yahweh of hosts,there shall not, on them, be any rain.

18. And, if the family of Egypt shall not come up, and shall not enter in, upon whom there falleth none, then shall smite them the plague wherewith Yahweh, did plague, the nations, because they came not up to celebrate the festival of booths.

19. This, shall be the punishment of Egypt,and the punishment of all the nations, when they come not up to celebrate the festival of booths.

20. In that day, shall there be   upon the bells of the horses, Holy unto Yahweh,and the caldrons in the house of Yahweh shall be like the dashing bowls before the altar.

21. And every caldron in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be Holy unto Yahweh of hosts,So shall all who are offering sacrifice, come in, and take of them, and boil therein,Neither shall there be a merchant any more in the house of Yahweh of hosts, in that day.
