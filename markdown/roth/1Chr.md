2. And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons,and the Philistines smote Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, sons of Saul.

3. And the battle, went sore, against Saul, and the archers discovered him with the bow,and he was terrified because of the archers.

4. Therefore said Saul unto his armour-bearer, Draw out thy sword and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armour-bearer would not, for he feared greatly,so then Saul took the sword, and fell upon it.

5. And, when his armour-bearer saw that Saul was dead, then, he also, fell upon the sword, and died.

6. So Saul died, and his three sons, and, all his house, together, died.

7. And, when all the men of Israel that were in the vale saw, that they had fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then forsook they their cities, and fled, and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.

8. And it came to pass, on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain,that they found Saul, and his sons, lying prostrate in Mount Gilboa.

9. So they stript him, and took his head, and his armour,and sent throughout the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it to their idols, and to the people.

10. And they put his armour, in the house of their gods,but, his skull, fastened they up, in the house of Dagon.

## 1 Chronicles 11

2. Moreover also, in time past even when Saul was king, thou, wast he that led out and brought in Israel,and Yahweh thy God said unto thee, Thou, shalt shepherd my people Israel, Yea, thou, shalt be chief ruler, over my people Israel.

3. Thus came all the elders of Israel unto the king, to Hebron, and David solemnised to them a covenant in Hebron, before Yahweh,and they anointed David to be king over Israel, according to the word of Yahweh, through Samuel.

4. Then went David and all Israel to Jerusalem, the same, was Jebus,where were the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land.

5. And the inhabitants of Jebus said unto David, Thou shalt not come in hither,But David captured the citadel of Zion, the same, is the city of David.

6. And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites, first, shall become a chief, and a ruler,So then Joab son of Zeruiah, went up first, and became a chief.

7. And David dwelt in the citadel,for this cause, did they call it, The City of David.

8. And he built the city round about, from Millo even as far as the circuit,but, Joab, suffered the remainder of the city to live.

9. Thus did David wax greater and yet greater,and, Yahweh of Hosts, was with him.

10. Now, these, are the chiefs of the heroes, that pertained to David, who held strongly with him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king,according to the word of Yahweh, concerning Israel.

11. And, this, is the number of the heroes who pertained to David,Jashobeam son of a Hachmonite, chief of the thirty, the same, brandished his spear over three hundredslain at one time.

12. And, after him, was Eleazar son of Dodai, the Ahohite,he, was among the three heroes;

13. he, was with David in Pas-dammim, where, the Philistines, were gathered together to battle, and there was a field-plot full of barley,and, the people, fled, from before the Philistines;

14. so they took their stand in the midst of the plot and rescued it, and smote the Philistines,and Yahweh wrought a great victory.

15. And three of the thirty chiefs went down upon the rock, unto David, into the cave of Adullam,a host of Philistines, being encamped in the vale of Rephaim.

16. Now, David, then was in the stronghold,and, a garrison of Philistines, then was in Bethlehem.

17. And David longed, and saidWho will give me to drink of the water, out of the well of Bethlehem, that is within the gate?

18. And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was within the gate, and bare it, and brought it in unto David,yet would not David drink it, but poured it out unto Yahweh;

19. and saidFar be it from me, of my God, that I should do this! The blood of these men, shall I drink, with their lives? For, with their lives, have they brought it! So he would not drink it. These things, did the three heroes.

20. And, Abishai brother of Joabhe, was the chief of three, he, having brandished his spear against three hundredwho were slain,and so, he, had a name among three.

21. Of the three in the second rank, was he honourable, therefore became he their captain,though, unto the   three, did he not attain.

22. Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, son of a man of valour, hero of many a deed, from Kabzielhe, smote the two   of Ariel of Moab, he, also went down and smote a lion in the midst of a pit, in time of snow;

23. he, also smote an Egyptian, a man of   stature, five cubits, and, in the hand of the Egyptian, was a spear like a weavers beam, so he went down unto him with a staff,and wrested the spear out of the hand of the Egyptian, and slew him with his spear.

24. These things, did Benaiah son of Jehoiada, so, he, had a name among three heroes.

25. Among the thirty, lo! honourable, was he, but, unto the   three, did he not attain,howbeit David set him over his council.

4. and Ishmaiah, the Gibeonite, a hero among the thirty, and over the thirty,and Jeremiah and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Jozabad, the Gederathite;

5. Eluzai and Jerimoth and Bealiah and Shemariah, and Shephatiah, the Haruphite;

6. Elkanah and Isshiah, and Azarel, and Joezer and Jashobeam, the Korahites;

7. and Joelah and Zebadiah, sons of Jeroham, of Gedor.

8. And, of the Gadites, there separated themselves unto David, to the stronghold towards the desert, heroes of valour, men of war, for battle, men that could handle shield and spear,and, faces of lions, were their faces, and, like gazelles upon the mountains, were they, for swiftness:

9. Ezer, the chief, Obadiah, the second,Eliab, the third;

10. Mashmannah, the fourth, Jeremiah, the fifth;

11. Attai, the sixth, Eliel the seventh;

12. Johanan, the eighth, Elzabad, the ninth;

13. Jeremiah, the tenth, Machbannai, the eleventh.

14. These, were of the sons of Gad, chiefs of the host,one to a hundred, the least, and, the greatest, to a thousand.

15. These, are they who passed over the Jordan, in the first month, when, it, was full, over all its banks,and they put to flight all them of the vales, to the east and to the west.

16. And there came, of the sons of Benjamin, and Judah, as far as the stronghold, unto David.

17. And David went forth to meet them, and responded, and said to them, If, peaceably, ye are come unto me, to help me, I shall have towards you, a heart for unity,but, if to betray me to mine adversaries, there being no violence in my hands, may the God of our fathers see and rebuke!

18. Then, the spirit, clothed Amasai, chief of the thirty, Thine, O David, Yea, with, thee, O son of Jesse! Prosperity, prosperity to thee, And prosperity to thy helpers, For thy God, hath helped thee: So David accepted them, and set them among the chiefs of the band.

19. And, of Manasseh, there fell away unto David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle, but they helped them not,for the lords of the Philistines advisedly sent him away, saying, At the price of our heads, he might fall away to his master, Saul.

20. When he went into Ziklag, there fell away unto him, of Manasseh, Adnah and Jozabad, and Jediael and Michael and Jozabad, and Elihu and Zillethai,chiefs of the thousands that pertained to Manasseh;

21. and, they, helped with David, against the   band, for, heroes of valour, were they all,and they became captains in the host;

22. for, from day to day, there came unto David, to help him,until it was a great camp, like a camp of God.

23. And, these, are the numbers of the chiefs armed for war, they came unto David, to Hebron,to turn round the kingdom of Saul unto him, according to the bidding of Yahweh:

24. Sons of Judah, bearers of shield and spear, six thousand and eight hundred, armed for war.

25. Of sons of Simeon, heroes of valour for the war, seven thousand, and one hundred.

26. Of the sons of Levi, four thousand, and six hundred.

27. And Jehoiada, was chief ruler for Aaron,and, with him, three thousand and seven hundred;

28. and Zadok, a young man, a hero of valour,and the house of his father, captains twenty and two.

29. And, of the sons of Benjamin, brethren of Saul, three thousand,and, hitherto, the greater part of them, had been keeping the charge of the house of Saul.

30. And, of the sons of Ephraim, twenty thousand, and eight hundred,heroes of valour, men of renown, to their ancestral house.

31. And, of the half tribe of Manasseh, eighteen thousand, who were distinguished by name, coming in to make David king.

32. And, of the sons of Issachar, such as were of good understanding of the times, to know what Israel, should do, their chiefs, were two hundred, and, all their brethren, were at their bidding.

33. Of Zebulunsuch as were ready to go forth in host, expert for battle with all weapons of war, fifty thousand,and for setting in array, not of two minds!

34. And, of Naphtali, a thousand captains,and, with them, with shield and spear, thirty-seven thousand.

35. And, of the Danite, expert for war, twenty-eight thousand, and six hundred.

36. And, of Asher, such as were ready to go forth in host to set in array for battle, forty thousand.

37. And, from over the Jordan, of the Reubenites and Gadites and half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of weapons of war for battle, a hundred and twenty thousand.

38. All these, being men of war, expert in setting in battle-array, with a perfect heart, came to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel,moreover also, all the rest of Israel, were of one heart to make David king.

39. So they were there, with David, three days, eating and drinking,for their brethren had made preparation for them.

40. Moreover also, they who were near of kin unto them, as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, were bringing bread, on asses and on camels and on mules and on oxen, meal-food, cakes of figs and cakes of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheepin abundance,for there was joy Israel.

## 1 Chronicles 13

1. And David consulted with the rulers of thousands and hundreds, even with every chief ruler.

2. And David said to all the convocation of Israel, If, unto you, it seemeth to be good, and from Yahweh our God, we will urgently send unto our brethren who remain in all the lands of Israel, and, with them, the priests and the Levites in their pasture-land cities,that they may gather together unto us;

3. and let us bring round the ark of our God, unto us,For they sought it not, in the days of Saul.

4. Than said all the convocation, that it should be done thus,for right was the thing, in the eyes of all the people.

5. So David convoked all Israel, from Shihor of Egypt, even unto the entering in of Hamath,to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.

6. And David went up and all Israel to Baalah, unto Kiriath-jearim, which pertaineth to Judah,to bring up from thence, the ark of GodYahweh who inhabiteth the cherubim, on which is called the Name.

7. And they carried the ark of God, upon a new wagon, out of the house of Aminadab,and, Uzza and Ahio, were driving the waggon.

8. And, David and all Israel, were dancing for joy before God, with all boldness, and with songs and with lyres, and with harps and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

9. And, when they came as far as the threshing-floor of Chidon, Uzza thrust forth his hand, to seize the ark, for the oxen were restive.

10. Then was kindled the anger of Yahweh against Uzza, and he smote him, because he thrust forth his hand unto the ark,and he died there, before God.

11. And it was a sadness unto David, that Yahweh had broken in with a breach against Uzza,and he called that place Perez-uzza,   unto this day.

12. And David was afraid of God, on that day, saying,How can I bring unto me, the ark of God?

13. So David removed not the ark unto him, into the city of David,but took it aside into the house of Obed-edom, the Gittite.

14. And the ark of God remained with the household of Obed-edom, in his house, three months,and Yahweh blessed the household of Obed-edom, and all that he had.

## 1 Chronicles 14

1. And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers unto David, and timber of cedars, with masons and artificers, to build for him a house.

2. So David perceived, that Yahweh, had confirmed him, as king over Israel,that his kingship was exalted, for the sake of his people Israel.

3. And David took more wives, in Jerusalem,and David begat more sons and daughters.

4. Now, these, are the names of them who were born, whom he had in Jerusalem,Shammua and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon;

5. and Ibhar and Elishua, and Elpelet;

6. and Nogah and Nepheg, and Japhia;

7. and Elishama and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.

8. And, when the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek to secure David,and David, hearing, went out against them.

9. Now, the Philistines, had come and spread themselves out, in the vale of Rephaim.

10. Then David asked of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And Yahweh said to him, Go up, and I will deliver them into thy hand.

11. So they came up in Baal-perazim, and David smote them there, and David said, God hath broken forth against mine enemies by my hand, like the breaking forth of waters,For this cause, called they the name of that place, Baal-perazim.

12. And they left their gods there,and David gave the word, and they were burned up in fire.

13. And the Philistines yet again spread themselves out in the vale.

14. So David, asked again, of God, and God said to him, Thou shalt not go up after them,get thee round, away from them, so shalt thou come in upon them, over against the mulberry-trees;

15. and it shall be, when thou hearest a sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, then, shalt thou go forth into the battle,for God will have gone forth before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.

16. So David did as God commanded him,and they smote the host of the Philistines, from Gibeon even unto Gezer.

17. And the name of David went forth, throughout all the lands,and, Yahweh, put the dread of him upon all the nations.

## 1 Chronicles 15

1. And he made him houses, in the city of David,and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.

2. Then, said David, None must carry the ark of God, save the Levites,for, of them, did Yahweh make choice, to bear the ark of Yahweh, and to attend it, unto times age-abiding.

3. So David convoked all Israel, unto Jerusalem,to bring up the ark of Yahweh, unto the place thereof, which he had prepared for it.

4. And David gathered together the sons of Aaron, and the Levites:

5. Of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brethren, one hundred and twenty;

6. of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brethren, two hundred and twenty;

7. of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brethren, one hundred and thirty;

8. of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren, two hundred;

9. of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brethren, eighty;

10. of the son of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brethren, a hundred and twelve.

11. Then called David, for Zadok and for Abiathar, the priests,and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah and Joel, Shemaiah and Eliel, and Amminadab;

12. and said unto them, Ye, are the chiefs of the fathers of the Levites,Hallow yourselves, ye and your brethren, so shall ye bring up the ark of YahwehGod of Israel, into   I have prepared for it.

13. Because, at the first, ye, did not   , Yahweh our God brake forth against us, because we sought him not in the appointed way.

14. So the priests and the Levites hallowed themselves,to bring up the ark of Yahweh, God of Israel.

15. And the sons of the Levites bare the ark of God, just as Moses commanded, according to the word of Yahweh,on their shoulder, with the staves upon them.

16. And David spake to the chiefs of the Levites, to station their brethren the singers, with instruments of song, harps and lyres, and cymbals,sounding aloud at the lifting up of the voice, for joy.

17. So the Levites caused to stand, Heman son of Joel, and, of his brethren, Asaph, son of Berechiah,and, of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan, son of Kushaiah;

18. and, with them, their brethren of the second degree,Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mickneiah, and Obed-edom and Jeiel, the door-keepers.

19. And, the singers, Heman, Asaph and Ethan, with cymbals of bronze, were to sound aloud;

20. and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah and Benaiah,with harps, over the trebles;

21. and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel and Azaziah,with lyres over the bass, to take the lead.

22. And, Chenaniah the leader of the Levites, in the service, used to give instructions in the service, because skilful was he.

23. And, Berechiah and Elkanah, were door-keepers to the ark.

24. And, Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, were blowing with the trumpets, before the ark of God,and, Obed-edom and Jehiah, were door-keepers, to the ark.

25. Thus, it was, David and the elders of Israel, and the rulers of thousands, who were going, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, out of the house of Obed-edom, with joy.

26. And so it was that, when God helped the Levites, who were bearing the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, they sacrificed seven bullocks and seven rams.

27. Now, David, was wrapped about with a robe of byssus, with all the Levites who were bearing the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the leader of the service rendered by the singers,but, upon David, was an ephod of white linen.

28. So, all Israel, were bringing up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, with shouting, and with sound of the horn, and with trumpets, and with cymbals,sounding aloud, with harps, and lyres.

29. And so it was that, when the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came in as far as the city of David,and Michal daughter of Saul looked forth through the window, and saw King David, dancing and playing, that she despised him in her heart.

## 1 Chronicles 16

1. So they brought in the ark of God, and placed it in the midst of the tent, which David had pitched for it,and they brought near ascending-sacrifices and peace-offerings, before God.

2. And, when David had made an end of offering the ascending-sacrifices, and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people, in the name of Yahweh.

3. And he apportioned, to every one of Israel, both man and woman,to every one, a loaf of bread, and a sweet drink, and a raisin cake.

4. And he placed before the ark of Yahweh certain of the Levites, as attendants,and to celebrate, and to give thanks and render praise, unto Yahweh, God of Israel;

5. Asaph the chief, and, second to him, Zechariah,Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with instruments of harps, and with lyres, and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud:

6. and Benaiah and Jahaziel, the priests,with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.

7. On that day, then, David gave   in chief, to give thanks unto Yahweh,through Asaph, and his brethren:

8. Give ye thanks to Yahweh, Call upon his name, Make known among the peoples, his doings;

9. Sing ye to him, Make music unto him, Speak ye of all his wonders.

10. Boast yourselves in his holy name, Joyful be the heart of them who are seeking Yahweh.

11. Search out Yahweh, and his power, Seek diligently his face, at all times.

12. Remember his wonders which he hath done, His splendid deeds, and the just decisions of his mouth.

13. O ye seed of Israel his servant, sons of Jacob his chosen ones:

14. Yahweh himself, is our God, through all the land, are his just decisions.

15. Remember yea to times age-abiding, his covenant, the word he hath commanded, to a thousand generations;

16. Which he solemnised with Abraham, and his oath, to Isaac;

17. And confirmed it, unto Jacob, for a statute, unto Israel, as a covenant age-abiding:

18. Saying, To thee, will I give the land of Canaan, as your inherited portion:

19. While, as yet, ye were men who could be counted, a very few, and sojourners therein:

20. And they wandered from nation to nation, and from one kingdom, to another people:

21. He suffered no man to oppress them, And reprovedfor their sakeskings!

22. Ye may not touch mine Anointed ones, And, to my Prophets, may ye do no wrong.

23. Sing to Yahweh, all the earth, Tell the tidings, from day to day, of his salvation:

24. Recount, among the nations, his glory, among all the peoples, his wonders.

25. For great is Yahweh, and worthy to be mightily praised, and to be revered is he above all gods;

26. For, all the gods of the peoples, are things of nought, but, Yahweh, made, the heavens.

27. Praise and majesty, are before him, Strength and joy, are in his dwelling-place.

28. Give to Yahweh, ye families of the peoples, Give to Yahweh, glory and strength:

29. Give to Yahweh, the glory of his name,Bring ye a present, and enter before him, Bow down to Yahweh, in the adornment of holiness:

30. Tremble at his presence, all the earth, But the world, shall be established, it shall not be shaken.

31. Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth exult, Let them say among the nations, Yahweh, hath become king!

32. Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof, Let the field leap for joy, and all that is therein:

33. Then, shall shout in triumph, the trees of the forest, before Yahweh, for he is coming, to judge the earth.

34. Give ye thanks unto Yahweh, For he is good, For, age-abiding, is his lovingkindness.

35. And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us and deliver us, from among the nations,that we may give thanks unto thy holy name, that we may triumph aloud in thy praise.

36. Blessed be Yahweh, God of Israel, from one age even to another age. Then said all the people, Amen, And gave praise to Yahweh.

37. So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, Asaph and his brethren,to be in attendance before the ark continually, for the duty of a day on its day;

38. and Obed-edom with his brethren, sixty-eight,and Obed-edom son of Jedithun and Hosah to be doorkeepers;

39. and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the habitation of Yahweh,in the high place that was in Gibeon:

40. to offer ascending-sacrifices unto Yahweh, upon the altar of ascending-sacrifice,continually, morning and evening,even according to all that is written in the law of Yahweh, which he commanded concerning Israel;

41. and, with them, Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest of the chosen ones, who were distinguished by name,to give thanks unto Yahweh, For, age-abiding, is his lovingkindness!

42. And, with them, Heman and Jeduthun,   the trumpets, and the cymbals, for sounding aloud, and the instruments for the songs of God,and the sons of Jeduthun, for the gate.

43. And all the people departed, every man to his house,and David went round, to bless his own household.

## 1 Chronicles 17

1. And it came to pass, when David had taken up his abode in his house, that David said unto Nathan the prophet, Lo! I, am dwelling in a house of cedars, but, the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, is under curtains.

2. Then said Nathan unto David, All that is in thy heart, do,for, God, is with thee.

3. But so it was that, in that night, the word of God came unto Nathan, saying:

4. Go and say unto David my servant, Thus, saith Yahweh,Thou, shalt not build me a house, to dwell in;

5. seeing that I have not dwelt in a house, since the day that I brought up Israel, until this day,but have been from tent to tent, and without a habitation.

6. Wheresoever I have wandered with all Israel, spake I ever, a word, with one of the judges of Israel, whom I charged to shepherd my people, saying,Wherefore have ye not built me a house of cedars?

7. Now, therefore, thus, shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, I myself, took thee from the pasture, from after the flock,to become leader over my people Israel;

8. and was with thee whithersoever thou didst go, and have out off all thine enemies, from before thee,and will make thee a name, like the name of the great ones, who are in the earth;

9. and will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall inhabit their place, and be unsettled no more,neither shall the sons of perversity again wear them out, as at the first;

10. even from the days when I put judges in charge over my people Israel, and have subdued all thine enemies,that I might make thee great, yea, a house, will Yahweh build for thee.

11. And it shall be that, when thy days are fulfilled, to sleep with thy fathers, then will I raise up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons,and I will establish his kingdom.

12. He, shall build me a house,and I will establish his throne unto times age-abiding.

13. I, will become his father, and, he, shall become my son,and, my lovingkindness, will I not cause to depart from him,as I caused it to depart from him who was before thee;

14. but I will cause him to remain over my house and over my kingdom, unto times age-abiding,and, his throne, shall be established, unto times age-abiding.

15. According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so, spake Nathan unto David.

16. Then entered King David, and tarried before Yahweh,and said, Who am, I, O Yahweh God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto;

17. and hast made this seem little in thine eyes, O God, in that thou hast spoken concerning the house of thy servant, for a great while to come? Thus wilt thou provide for me, according to the rank of manhood, and hast exalted me, O Yahweh God!

18. What, yet further, can David say unto thee,   to honour thy servant,seeing that, thou thyself, knowest, thine own servant?

19. O Yahweh, for the sake of thy servant, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this great thing,making known all the great things.

20. O Yahweh, there is none like unto thee, yea there is no God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.

21. Who then is like thy people Israel, a nation alone in the earth,whom God went to redeem, to be his own people, to make for thyself a name for great and fearful things, to drive out, nations, from before thy people, whom thou didst redeem out of Egypt;

22. and didst appoint thy people Israel for thyself as a people, unto times age-abiding,thou thyself, also, O Yahweh, becoming their God?

23. Now, therefore, O Yahweh, the word which thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, be it steadfast unto times age-abiding,and do as thou hast spoken:

24. yea let it be steadfast, and so let thy Name be magnified unto times age-abiding, saying, Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, is a God to Israel! seeing that, the house of David thy servant, is established before thee.

25. For, thou, O my God, hast unveiled the ear of thy servant, that thou wilt build for him a house,for this cause, hath thy servant found   to pray before thee.

26. Now, therefore, O Yahweh, thou, art God,therefore hast thou spoken concerning thy servant this goodness.

27. Now, therefore, let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be unto times age-abiding before thee,for, thou O Yahweh, hast blessed, and it is to be blessed unto times age-abiding.

## 1 Chronicles 18

1. And it canto to pass, after this, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them,and took Gath and her villages, out of the hand of the Philistines.

2. And he smote Moab,and the Moabites became servants to David, bearers of a present.

3. And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah, towards Hamath,as he went to establish his hold of the river Euphrates.

4. And David captured from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen,and David destroyed all the chariots, saving that he reserved from them a hundred chariots.

5. And, when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians, twenty-two thousand men.

6. And David put   in Syria of Damascus, and so it was that the Syrians became, Davids, servants, bearers of a present,so Yahweh gave victory to David, whithersoever he went.

7. And David took the shields of gold, that were upon the servants of Hadarezer,and brought them to Jerusalem;

8. also, from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadarezer, David took very much bronze,therewith, did Solomon make the sea of bronze, and the pillars, and the vessels of bronze.

9. And, when Tou, king of Hamath, heard that David had smitten all the force of Hadarezer king of Zobah,

10. he sent Hadoram his son unto King David, to ask after his welfare, and to bless him, because he had made war against Hadarezer and had smitten him, for, a man making wars against Tou, had been Hadarezer,and    all manner of vessels of gold and silver and bronze;

11. them also, did King David hallow unto Yahweh, with the silver and the gold, that he bare away from all the nations,from Edom, and from Moab, and from the sons of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.

12. Moreover, Abishai, son of Zeruiah, smote Edom, in the Valley of Salt,eighteen thousand;

13. and set, in Edom, garrisons, and all Edom became servants unto David,and Yahweh gave David the victory, whithersoever he went.

14. So David reigned over all Israel,and he was executing justice and righteousness for all his people;

15. and, Joab, son of Zeruiah, was over the army,and, Jehoshaphat, son of Elihud, was recorder;

16. and, Zadok, son of Ahitub, and Abimelech son of Abiathar, were priests,and, Shavsha, was scribe;

17. and, Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, was over the Cherethites, and the Pelethites,and, the sons of David, were first, in attendance on the king.

## 1 Chronicles 19

1. And it came to pass, after this, that Nahash king of the sons of Ammon died,and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.

2. Then said DavidI will show lovingkindness unto Hanun, son of Nahash,for his father shewed unto me lovingkindness. So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father,and the servants of David came into the land of the sons of Ammon unto Hanun, to console him.

3. Then said the rulers of the sons of Ammon unto Hanun, Doth David honour thy father in thine eyes, that he hath sent to thee comforters? Is it not, for the sake of exploring and overthrowing, and spying out the land, that his servants have come to thee?

4. So Hanun took the servants of David, and shaved them, and cut off their upper garments in the middle, as far as their parts of shame,and let them go.

5. And people went and told David, concerning the men, so he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed,and the king saidTarry at Jericho, until your beards be grown, and then return.

6. And, when the sons of Ammon saw, that they had made themselves odious with David, Hanun and the sons of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver, to hire for themselvesout of Mesopotamia, and out of Aram-maacah, and out of Zobah,chariots, and horsemen.

7. So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah, and his people, who came and pitched before Medeba,and the sons of Ammon gathered themselves together out of their cities, and entered into the war.

8. Now, when David heard, he sent Joab and all the army of heroes.

9. And the sons of Ammon came out, and set in array for the battle, at the opening of the city,whereas, the kings who had come, were by themselves, in the field.

10. So, when Joab saw that the battle confronted him, before and behind,he chose out of all the choice in Israel, and set in array to meet the Syrians;

11. and, the rest of the people, delivered he into the hand of Abishai his brother,and they set in array, to meet the sons of Ammon.

12. And he saidIf, too strong for me, be the Syrians, then shalt thou come to my help,but, if, the sons of Ammon, be too strong for thee, then will I help thee.

13. Be strong, and let us put forth our strength, for the sake of our people, and for the sake of the cities of our God,and let, Yahweh, do, what is good in his own eyes.

14. Then did Joab, and all the people who were with him, draw near before the Syrians unto the battle,and they fled from before him.

15. And, when, the sons of Ammon, saw that the Syrians had fled, then fled, they also, from before Abishai his brother, and entered the city,and Joab came to Jerusalem.

16. And when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated before Israel, then sent they messengers, and brought out the Syrians who were Beyond the River,with Shophach captain of the army of Hadarezer, before them.

17. And it was told David, and he gathered together all Israel, and crossed the Jordan, and came unto them, and set in array against them,and, when David had set in array against the Syrians for battle, they fought with him.

18. And the Syrians fled from before Israel, and David slew of the Syrians   seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen,and, Shophach captain of the army, he put to death.

19. And, when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with David and served him,neither would the Syrians help the sons of Ammon any more.

1. And it came to pass, at the time of the turn of the year, at the time of the going forth of kings, that Joab led forth the force of the army, and laid waste the land of the sons of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah, but, David, was tarrying in Jerusalem,and Joab smote Rabbah, and overthrew it.

2. And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it weighed a talent of gold, and, therein, were precious stones, and it was   on the head of David,and, the spoil of the city, brought he forth, in great abundance;

3. and, the people that were therein, brought he forth, and cut with the saw and with threshing sledges of iron and with axes, thus also, used David to do unto all the cities of the son of Ammon,and David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

4. And it came to pass, after this, that there was yet again a battle in Gezer, with the Philistines,then, Sibbecai the Hushathite smote Sippai of the children of the giants, and they were subdued.

5. And there again came to be a battle with the Philistines,and Elhanan son of Jair smote Lahmi, brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear, was like a weavers beam.

6. And there again came to be war with Gath,where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes, six on each hand and foot, were four and twenty, and, he also, had been born unto the giant.

7. But, when he reproached Israel, Jonathan, son of Shimea brother of David, smote him.

8. These, were born unto the giant in Gath,but they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

## 1 Chronicles 21

1. Then the accuser stood up, against Israel,and moved David, to number Israel.

2. And David said unto Joab and unto the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel, from Beer-sheba even unto Dan,and bring   unto me, that I may know the number of them.

3. Then said Joab, May Yahweh add unto his people, as many as they are, a hundred times, but are they not, my lord O king, all of them my lords, as servants? wherefore should my lord seek this? wherefore should it become guilt to Israel?

4. But, the word of the king, prevailed against Joab,and Joab departed, and went to and fro throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.

5. And Joab delivered the sum of the number of the people, unto David,and all Israel was found to be a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men, who drew sword, and Judah, four hundred and seventy thousand men, who drew sword.

6. But, Levi and Benjamin, counted he not among them,for detestable was the word of the king unto Joab.

7. And it was displeasing in the eyes of God, concerning this thing,therefore smote he Israel.

8. And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing,but, now, I beseech thee, take away the iniquity of thy servant, for I have shown myself very foolish.

9. Then spake Yahweh unto Gad, the seer of David saying:

10. Goand thou shalt speak unto David, saying, Thus, saith Yahweh, Three things, do I offer thee,choose thee one from among them, that I may do it unto thee.

11. So Gad came unto David,and said to him, Thus, saith Yahweh,

12. Choose thee:Whether, for three years,   famine, Or, for three months, that thou flee before thine adversaries, while the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee, Or, for three days, the sword of Yahweh, and pestilence be in the land, with, the messenger of Yahweh, laying waste throughout all the boundary of Israel,Now, therefore, see, what, answer, I shall return unto him that sent me.

13. And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait,Oh let me fall, I pray thee, into the hand of Yahweh, for abounding are his compassions, exceedingly, but, into the hand of man, let me not fall.

14. So Yahweh laid pestilence, upon Israel,and there fell, of Israel, seventy thousand men.

15. And God sent a messenger to Jerusalem, to lay it waste, but, as he was laying it waste, Yahweh looked, and relented concerning the calamity, and said unto the messenger who was laying waste, Enough! now, stay thy hand. And, the messenger of Yahweh, was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

16. And, when David lifted up his eyes, and saw the messenger of Yahweh, standing, between the earth and the heavens, and his sword drawn, in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem, then fell David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, upon their faces.

17. And David said unto God, Was it not, I, who gave word to number the people? Yea, I, it was who sinned and did the great wrong, what then had, these sheep, done? O Yahweh, my God, let thy hand, I beseech thee, be against me, and against the house of my father, but not against, thy people, that they should be plagued!

18. And, the messenger of Yahweh, commanded Gad, to say unto David,that David should go up, to rear an altar unto Yahweh, in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

19. So David went up, according to the word of Gad, which he spake in the name of Yahweh.

20. And Ornan turned, and saw the messenger, but, his four sons with him, were hiding themselves,now, Ornan, had been threshing wheat.

21. Then came David unto Ornan,and Ornan looked, and saw David, and went forth out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself unto David, with his face to the ground.

22. And David said unto Ornan, Grant me the place of the threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar, unto Yahweh,for silver in full, shalt thou grant it me, that the plague may be stayed from off the people.

23. And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do what is good in his own eyes,see! I have given the oxen for ascending-sacrifices, and, the threshing implements for wood, and the wheat for a meal-offering,the whole, have I given.

24. Then said King David to Ornan, Nay! but I will, surely buy, it for silver in full,for I will not take that which is thine for Yahweh, nor offer an ascending-sacrifice that hath cost me nothing.

25. So David gave to Ornan, for the place,shekels of gold, by weight, six hundred.

26. And David built there an altar unto Yahweh, and caused to go up ascending-sacrifices, and peace-offerings,and called unto Yahweh, and he responded to him, by fire, out of the heavens, upon the altar of ascending-sacrifice.

27. And Yahweh gave word to tile messenger, and he put back his sword into its sheath.

28. At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.

29. But, the habitation of Yahweh, which Moses made in the desert, and the altar of ascending-sacrifice, were, at that time, in the high place at Gibeon;

30. and David could not go before it, to seek God,for he had been terrified, because of the sword of the messenger of Yahweh.

## 1 Chronicles 22

1. Then said David, This, is the house of Yahweh God,and, this, is the altar of ascending-sacrifice, for Israel.

2. And David gave word, to gather together the sojourners, who were in the land of Israel,and he set hewers to hew squared stones, for building the house of God;

3. and, iron in abundance, for nails for the doors of the gates, and for hooks, did David prepare,and bronze in abundance, without weight;

4. and cedar-trees, even without number,for the Zidonians and the Tyreans brought cedar-trees in abundance, unto David.

5. And David said, Solomon my son, is young and tender, and, the house to be built, must be great and lofty and famous and beautiful, for all lands,oh let me then prepare for it. So David prepared abundantly, before his death.

6. Then he called for Solomon his son,and charged him, to build a house, for Yahweh, God of Israel.

7. And David said to Solomon his son,As for me, it was, near my heart, to build a house for the Name of Yahweh my God;

8. but the word of Yahweh came unto me, saying, Blood in abundance, hast thou shed, and, great wars, hast thou made,thou shalt not build a house for my Name, because, much blood, hast thou shed upon the earth, before me.

9. Lo! a son, born to thee, He, shall be a man of rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies, round about,for, Solomon, shall be his Name, and, peace and quietness, will I bestow upon Israel, in his days;

10. He, shall build a house for my Name, and, he, shall be my son, and, I, will be his father,therefore will I establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel, unto times age-abiding:

11. Now, my son, Yahweh be with thee,so shalt thou be prosperous, and shalt build the house of Yahweh thy God, according as he hath spoken concerning thee.

12. Only Yahweh give thee discretion and understanding, and give thee charge over Israel,so that thou take heed unto the law of Yahweh thy God.

13. Then, shalt thou prosper, if thou take heed to do the statutes and the regulations, which Yahweh commanded Moses, concerning Israel,be strong and bold, thou mayst not be in fear, nor be dismayed.

14. Lo! then, in my humiliation, have I prepared for the house of Yahweh, of gold a hundred thousand talents, and of silver a thousand thousand talents, and, as for bronze and iron, without weight, for, an abundance, hath it become,timber also and stone, have I prepared, and, thereunto, thou canst add.

15. And, with thee, in abundance, are workmen, hewers and carvers of stone and wood,and every sort of wise man, in all manner of work:

16. for gold and for silver and for bronze and for iron, without number. Arise and do, and Yahweh be with thee!

17. And David charged all the rulers of Israel, to help Solomon his son:

18. Is not, Yahweh your God, with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath given into my hand, the inhabitants of the land, and subdued is the land before Yahweh, and before his people.

19. Now, apply your heart and your soul, to seek unto Yahweh your God,and then arise ye and build the sanctuary of Yahweh Elohim, that ye may bring the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and the holy vessels of God, into the house which hath been built for the Name of Yahweh.

## 1 Chronicles 23

1. Now, David, was old, and satisfied with days,so he made Solomon his son king, over Israel;

2. and gathered together all the rulers of Israel, with the priests, and the Levites.

3. Now the Levites were numbered, from thirty years old and upwards,and their number by their polls, of mature men, was thirty-eight thousand.

4. Of theseto preside over the work of the house of Yahweh, were twenty-four thousand,and officers and judges, six thousand;

5. and four thousand, were doorkeepers,and, four thousand, were offerers of praise unto Yahweh, with instruments, which   I made for offering praise.

6. And David divided them into courses,pertaining to the sons of Levi, to Gershon, Kohath and Merari.

7. Of the Gershonites, Ladan and Shimei.

8. The sons of Ladan, the chief Jehiel, and Zetham and Joel, three.

9. The sons of Shimei, Shelomoth and Haziel and Haran, three,these, were the ancestral chiefs of Ladan.

10. And, the sons of Shimei, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah,these, were the sons of Shimei, four.

11. And Jahath was chief, and Zizah the second,but, Jeush and Beriah, had not many sons, so they became an ancestral house, by one reckoning.

12. The sons of Kohath, Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.

13. The sons of Amram, Aaron and Moses,and Aaron was separated, to hallow the holy of holies, he and his sons, unto times age-abiding, to make a perfume before Yahweh, to be in attendance upon him, and to bless in his name, unto times age-abiding;

14. and, as for Moses, the man of God, his sons, were called unto the tribe of Levi.

15. The sons of Moses, were Gershom, and Eliezer.

16. the sons of Gershom, were Shebuel the chief;

17. and the sons of Eliezer were Rehabiah the chief,and Eliezer had no other sons, but, the sons of Rehabiah, were very many.

18. The sons of Izhar, Shelomith the chief.

19. The sons of Hebron, Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jehaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.

20. The sons of Uzziel, Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.

21. The sons of Merari, were Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli, were Eleazar and Kish.

22. But Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only,and so the sons of Kish their brethren took them.

23. The sons of Mushi, were Mahli and Eder and Jeremoth, three.

24. These, were the sons of Levi by their ancestral house, the ancestral chiefs of them who were counted in the number of their names, by their polls, doing the work, for the service of the house of Yahweh,from twenty years old, and upwards.

25. For, said David, Yahweh the God of Israel hath given rest unto his people,and hath taken up his habitation in Jerusalem, unto times age-abiding;

26. moreover also, as for the Levites, they have no need to bear the habitation, nor any of its vessels in the laborious work thereof.

27. For, by the last words of David, the same, were the number of the sons of Levi,from twenty years old, and upwards.

28. For, their duty, wasto be in attendance upon the sons of Aaron, in the laborious work of the house of Yahweh, over the courts, and over the chambers, and over the purifying of everything holy,and doing the laborious work, of the house of God;

29. and for the bread set in array, and for the fine meal for the meal-offering, and for the unleavened cakes, even for that which is baked in a pan, for the moistened food,even of every measure, and size;

30. and to stand, morning by morning, to give thanks and offer praise unto Yahweh,and, likewise, at even;

31. and for all the offering of ascending-sacrifices unto Yahweh, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts,by number, according to the manner prescribed for them continually, before Yahweh;

32. and they shall keep the charge of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron, their brethren,in the laborious work of the house of Yahweh.

## 1 Chronicles 24

1. Now, the sons of Aaron, had their courses,the sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar;

2. but Nadab and Abihu, died, before their father, and sons, had they none,but Eleazar and Ithamar became priests;

3. and David apportioned to them courses, both to Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and to Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar,by their appointed place in their service.

4. But the sons of Eleazar were found to be more numerous, by the chiefs of their able men, than were the sons of Ithamar, so they divided them,the sons of Eleazar, had chiefs, of the ancestral house, sixteen, whereas, the sons of Ithamar, had of their ancestral house, eight.

5. They divided them, therefore, by   lots, these with those,for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of God, from among the sons of Eleazar, and among the sons of Ithamar.

6. And Shemaiah son of Nethanel the scribe from among the Levites, wrote them down, before the king and the rulers and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the ancestral chiefs, pertaining to the priests and to the Levites,one ancestral house, was taken for Eleazar, and, was equally taken, for Ithamar.

17. for Jachin, the twenty-first, for Gamul, the twenty-second;

18. for Delaiah, the twenty-third, for Maaziah, the twenty-fourth.

19. These, were their appointed places for their service, for entering the house of Yahweh, according to the regulation of them, by the hand of Aaron their father,just as Yahweh God of Israel, commanded him.

20. Now, as for the sons of Levi who remained, of the sons of Amram, Shubael, of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.

21. Of Rehabiah, of the sons of Rehabiah, the chief Isshiah;

29. of Kishthe sons of Kish, Jerameel;

30. and, the sons of Mushi, Mahli and Eder and Jerimoth. These, were the sons of the Levites, belonging to their ancestral house.

31. Moreover, they also, cast lots along with their brethren the sons of Aaron, before David the king and Zadok and Ahimelech, and the ancestral chiefs, pertaining to the priests and to the Levites, the ancestral chief along with his younger brethren.

## 1 Chronicles 25

1. And David and the captains of the host set apart for service, unto the sons of Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun, such as should prophesy, with lyres, with harps, and with cymbals,and, the number of the workers, for their service, was:

## 1 Chronicles 28

1. And David called together all the rulers of Israel, the rulers of tribes and the rulers of the courses who waited upon the king,and the rulers of thousands and the rulers of hundreds, and the rulers over all the possessions and substance that belonged to the king and to his sons, with the courtiers and the heroes, even every hero of valour, unto Jerusalem.

2. Then David the king rose up on his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren and my people,As for me, it was near my heart, to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and for the footstool of our God, and I made ready to build.

3. But, God, said to me, Thou shalt not build a house for my Name,for, a man of war, thou art, and, blood, hast thou shed.

4. Howbeit Yahweh, God of Israel, made choice of me, out of all of the house of my father, to become king over Israel unto times age-abiding, for, of Judah, had he made choice to be chief ruler, and, in the house of Judah, the house of my father,and, among the sons of my father, with me, was he well-pleased, to make me king over all Israel;

5. and, from among all my sons,for, many sons, hath Yahweh given me,he hath made choice my son, to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of Yahweh, over Israel.

6. And he said unto am, Solomon thy sonhe, shall build my house, and my courts,for I have made choice of him that he may be my son, and that, I, may be his father.

7. So will I establish his kingdom, unto times age-abiding,if he be strong, to do my commandments and my regulations, as at this day.

8. Now, therefore, in the eyes of all Israelthe convocation of Yahweh, and in the ears of our God, Observe and seek all the commandments of Yahweh your God,to the end that ye may possess the good land,and suffer your sons after you to inherit it, unto times age-abiding.

9. Thou, therefore, Solomon my son, Know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing soul, for, all hearts, doth Yahweh search, and, every devised purpose, doth he understand,If thou seek him, He will be found of thee, but, if thou forsake him, He will cast thee off for ever.

10. See! now, that, Yahweh, hath made choice of thee, to build a house for a sanctuarybe strong and do!

11. Then gave David unto Solomon his son, the plan of the porch, and the recesses thereof, and the treasuries thereof, and the upper rooms thereof, and the inner chambers thereof, and the recess for the propitiatory;

12. and the plan of all which had come by the spirit to be with him, for the courts of the house of Yahweh, and for all the rooms round about,for the treasuries of the house of God, and for the treasuries of hallowed things;

13. and for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of Yahweh,and for all the utensils of the service of the house of Yahweh:

14. of gold, by weight, for the gold, for all manner of utensils for each several service,for all manner of utensils of silver, by weight, for all manner of utensils for each several service;

15. and a weight, for the lampstands of gold, and their lamps of gold, by the weight of each several lampstand, and the lamps thereof,and for the lampstands of silver by weight, for each lampstand and the lamps thereof, according to the service of each several lampstand.

16. And the gold   by weight for the tables for setting in array, for each several table,and silver, for the tables of silver;

17. and the fleshhooks and the bowls and the cups, pure gold,and for the goblets of gold, by weight for each several goblet, and for the goblets of silver, by weight for each several goblet;

18. and, for the altar of incense, refined gold, by weight,and, for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubim, gold, for them that were spreading out, and covering the ark of the covenant of Yahweh:

19. the whole in writing, From the hand of Yahweh upon me, to give understanding,all the works of the pattern.

20. Then said David, unto Solomon his son, Be strong and bold, and act, thou mayest not fear nor be dismayed,for, Yahweh, God, my God, will be with thee, he will not let thee go, neither will he forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work of the service of the house of Yahweh.

21. And there are the courses of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of the house of God,and, with thee, in all manner of work, is every willing, skilful man for any service, also the rulers and all the people, for all thine affairs.

## 1 Chronicles 29

1. Then said David the king unto all the convocation, Solomon my son, the one, of whom God hath made choice, is young and tender,and, the work, is great, seeing that, not for man, is the palace, but for Yahweh Elohim.

2. And, with all my might, have I made preparation for the house of my God, the gold for the gold, and the silver for the silver, and the bronze for the bronze, the iron for the iron, and the wood for the wood,and beryl stones and settings, stones coloured and particoloured, and all manner of precious stones and stones of white marble, in abundance.

3. And yet further, because of my delighting in the house of my God, having a treasure of mine own in gold and silver, I have given for the house of my God, above and beyond all that I have prepared for the holy house:

4. three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir,and seven thousand talents of refined silver, for overlaying the walls of the recesses.

5. Of gold for the gold, and of silver for the silver, and for all manner of work in the hand of artificers,Who then is ready to offer willingly, by filling his hand to-day, unto Yahweh?

6. Then offered they willinglythe ancestral rulers and the rulers of the tribes of Israel, and the rulers of thousands and hundreds, even to the rulers of the work of the king;

7. and gave for the service of the house of God, of gold, five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and, of silver, ten thousand talents, and, of bronze, eighteen thousand talents,and, of iron, one hundred thousand talents.

8. And, every one with whom were found precious stones, gave to the treasure of the house of Yahweh,unto the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.

9. So the people rejoiced because they willingly offered, for, with a perfect heart, offered they willingly unto Yahweh,moreover also, David the king, rejoiced with great joy.

10. Therefore did David bless Yahweh in the eyes of all the convocation,and David said, Blessed art thou, O Yahweh, the God of Israel our father, from age even unto age.

11. Thine, O Yahweh, are Greatness, and Might, and Beauty, and Victory, and Majesty, nay! all in the heavens and in the earth,thine, O Yahweh, is the kingdom, who art exalted above all,as chief;

12. and, riches and honour, are from before thee, and, thou, art ruling over all, and, in thy hand, are power and might,and, in thy hand, it is, to give greatness and strength unto any.

13. Now, therefore, O our God, we are giving thanks unto thee,and offering praise, unto thy beautiful Name.

14. And yet, who am, I, and who are my people, that we should be able to offer willingly like this? for, from thee, is the whole, and, out of thine own hand, have we given unto thee;

15. for, sojourners, are we before thee, and strangers, like all our fathers,like a shadow, are our days upon the earth, and there is no hope.

16. O Yahweh our God, all this abundance which we have prepared, to build thee a house for thy holy Name, out of thine own hand, it is, and, thine, is the whole.

17. But I know, O my God, that, thou, art proving the heart, and, with uprightness, wilt thou be pleased,I, in the uprightness of my heart, have willingly offered all these things, now, therefore, thy people who are found here, have I seen with joy, offering willingly unto thee.

18. O Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, oh guard this age-abidingly, as the devised purpose of the heart of thy people,and establish thou their heart, unto thyself.

19. Also, unto Solomon my son, give thou an undivided heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes,to do the whole, and to build the palace for which I have prepared.

20. Then said David, unto all the convocation, Bless, I beseech you, Yahweh your God. So all the convocation blessed Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and did bend their heads and bow themselves down unto Yahweh, and unto the king;

21. and sacrificed unto Yahweh sacrifices, and caused to go up ascending-offerings unto Yahweh, on the morrow of that day, a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, a thousand young sheep, and the drink-offerings thereof,and sacrifices in abundance, for all Israel.

22. And so they did eat and drink before Yahweh on that day, with great joy,and they, the second time, made Solomon son of David king, and anointed him unto Yahweh to be chief ruler, and Zadok to be priest.

23. So Solomon took his seat upon the throne of Yahweh, as king, instead of David his father, and prospered,and all Israel, hearkened unto him.

24. And, all the rulers, and the heroes, yea moreover all the sons of King David, gave a hand, under Solomon the king.

25. And Yahweh magnified Solomon, exceedingly, before the eyes of all Israel,and gave unto him a royal majesty, that had not been on any king before him, over Israel.

26. Thus, David son of Jesse, reigned over all Israel;

27. and, the days that he reigned over Israel, were forty years,in Hebron reigned he seven years, and in Jerusalem, reigned he, thirty-three.

28. And he died in a good old age, satisfied with days, riches and honour,and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.

29. Now, the acts of David the king, first and last, behold them! written in the records of Samuel the seer, and in the records of Nathan the prophet, and in the records of Gad the seer:

30. with all his reign, and his might,and the times which passed over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the lands.
