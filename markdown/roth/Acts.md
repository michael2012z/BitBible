## Acts 1

__but, these, are written, that ye may believe that, Jesus, is, the Christ, the Son of God; and that, believing, ye may have life in his name.__

1. The first narrative, indeed, made I, concerning all things, O Theophilus, which Jesus began both to do and teach,

2. Until the day when, having given command unto the apostles, whom through Holy Spirit he had chosen, he was taken up;

3. Unto whom he also presented himself alive, after he had suffered, by many sure tokens, throughout forty days making himself visible unto them, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God.

4. And being in company with them he charged them, from Jerusalem, not to absent themselves, butTo abide around the promise of the Father which ye have heard of me,

5. Because, John, indeed, immersed with water; but, ye, in Holy Spirit shall be immersed,after not many of these days.

6. They, therefore, having come together, began to question him, sayingLord! art thou at this time duly establishing the kingdom unto Israel?

7. He said unto themIt is not yours to get to know times or seasons which the Father hath put in his own authority;

8. But ye shall receive power when the Holy Spirit cometh upon you, and ye shall be my witnesses, both in Jerusalem and  in  all Judaea and Samaria and as far as the uttermost part of the land.

9. And having said these things, as they were beholding, he was lifted up, and a cloud caught him away from their eyes.

10. And, while they were looking steadfastly into heaven as he was going his way, then lo! two men had taken their stand beside them, in white garments,

11. Who also saidMen of Galilee! why stand ye looking into heaven? This Jesus who hath been taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, in like manner as ye yourselves have gazed upon him going into heaven.

12. Then returned they into Jerusalem, from a mountain called Olivet, which is nigh unto Jerusalem a Sabbath days journey.

13. And, when they had entered, into the upper-story went they up, where remained behindboth Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the zealot, and Judas the son of James.

14. These all were giving constant attention with one accord unto the prayer, with  certain  women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.

15. And, in these days, Peter, standing up in the midst of the brethren, said,and there was a multitude of names, of one accord, about a hundred and twenty,

16. Brethren! It was needful for the Scripture to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spake beforehand through the mouth of David, concerning Judas,who became guide unto them who apprehended Jesus;

17. For that he had come to be reckoned among us and obtained the lot of this ministry.

18. This man therefore had possessed himself of a field out of the reward of unrighteousness,and falling headlong burst asunder in the midst, and forth gushed all his bowels;

19. And it became known unto all them who were dwelling in Jerusalem, so that that field was called, in their language, Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.

20. For it is written in the book of Psalms: Let his encampment become desolate, and let there be none to dwell therein! Andhis overseership, let a different man take!

21. It is needful then that, of the men who companied with us during all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out over us,

22. Beginning from the immersion by John until the day when he was taken up from us, that, a witness of his resurrection along with us, should one of these become.

23. And they appointed two,Joseph, called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.

24. And, praying, they saidThou Lord! observer of the hearts of all men! shew forth whom thou hast chosen,of these two, one;

25. To take the place of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas went aside, to go his way unto his own place.

26. And they gave lots for them; and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

## Acts 2

1. And, when the day of pentecost was filling up   they were all together with one intent;

2. When there came suddenly out of heaven a sound, just as of a mighty rushing wind,-and it filled all the house where they were sitting;

3. And there appeared unto themparting asundertongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each one of them;

4. And they were all filled with Holy Spirit, and began to be speaking with other kinds of tongues just as the Spirit was giving unto them to be sounding forth.

5. Now there were in Jerusalem sojourning Jews, reverent men from every nation who were under heaven;

6. And this sound occurring the throng came together and was thrown into confusion, because each one severally heard in his own language them who were speaking;

7. Yea they were beside themselves and did marvel, sayingLo! are not all these who are speaking Galilaeans?

8. How then do, we, hear each one in our own language in which we were born?

9. Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and those dwelling in Mesopotamia, Judaea also and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,

10. Phrygia also and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of the Libya that is towards Cyrene, and the sojourning Romans,both Jews and proselytes,

11. Cretans and Arabians, we do hear them speaking in our own tongues the magnificent things of God.

12. But they were all beside themselves and were utterly at a loss, saying one to anotherWhat doth this please to be?

13. While, others, in mockery were sayingWith sweet wine, are they drunken!

14. But, taking his stand, Peter with the eleven lifted up his voice, and sounded out unto themYe men of Judaea, and all ye who are sojourning in Jerusalem! Let, this, unto you be known, and give ear unto my declarations;

15. For not, as, ye, suppose, are these men drunken, for it is the third hour of the day;

16. But this is that which hath been spoken through the prophet Joel

17. And it shall be, in the last days saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and, your young men, visions shall see and, your elders, in dreams shall dream,

18. And, even upon my men-servants and upon my maid-servants in those days, will I pour out of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy;

19. And I will set forth wonders in the heaven above, and signs upon the earth beneath,blood and fire and vapour of smoke:

20. The sun, shall be turned into darkness and, the moon, into blood,before the coming of the day of the Lord, the great and manifest   ;

21. And it shall beWhosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved.

22. Ye men of Israel! hear these words:Jesus the Nazarene, a man pointed out of God unto you by mighty works and wonders and signs, which God did through him in your midst, just as ye yourselves know,

23. The same, by the marked out counsel and foreknowledge of God given up, through the hands of lawless men, suspending, ye slew,

24. Whom, God, raised up, loosing the pangs of death, inasmuch as it was, not possible, for him to continue held fast by it.

25. For, David, saith concerning himI foresaw the Lord before me continually, because he is, on my right hand, that I may not be shaken;

26. For this reason, was my heart made glad and my tongue exulted,ye further, even my flesh, shall encamp on hope:

27. Because thou wilt not abandon my soul unto hades, neither wilt thou give thy man of lovingkindness to see corruption;

28. Thou madest known unto me paths of life, thou wilt make me full of gladness with thy countenance.

29. Brethren! it is, allowable, to say with freedom of speech unto you, concerning the patriarch David,that he both died and was buried, and, his tomb, is among us until this day.

30. Being then, a prophet, and knowing that, with an oath, God had sworn unto him, of the fruit of his loins, to seat on his throne,

31. With foresight, spake he concerning the resurrection of the Christthat neither was he abandoned unto hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.

32. The same Jesus, hath God raised up, whereof, all we, are witnesses!

33. By the right hand of God, therefore, having been exalted, also, the promise of the Holy Spirit, having received from the Father, He hath poured out this which, yourselves, do see and hear.

34. For, David, hath not ascended into the heavens; but he saith, himself,Said the Lord unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand,

35. Until I make thy foes thy footstool.

36. Assuredly, then, let all the house of Israel know: that, both Lord and Christ, hath God made him, even the same Jesus whom, ye, crucified!

37. And, when they heard this, they were pricked to the heart, and said unto Peter and the rest of the apostlesWhat are we to do, brethren?

38. And Peter   unto themRepent ye, and let each one of you be immersed, in the name of Jesus Christ, into the remission of your sins,and ye shall receive the free-gift of the Holy Spirit;

39. For, unto you, is the promise, and unto your children,and unto all them who are afar off: as many soever as the Lord our God shall call unto him.

40. And, with many different words, bare he frail witness, and went on exhorting them sayingBe saved from this perverse generation!

41. They, therefore, who welcomed his word, were immersed; and there were added, on that day, about three thousand souls.

42. And they went on to give constant attentionunto the teaching of the apostles, and unto the fellowship, unto the breaking of bread, and unto the prayers.

43. And there came on every soul, fear, and, many wonders and signs, through means of the apostles, were coming to pass.

44. And, all who believed, with one accord, began to hold all things common;

45. and, their possessions and goods, were they selling and distributing them unto all, in so far as anyone had need.

46. And, daily giving attendance with one intent in the temple and, at home, breaking bread, they were partaking of food with exultation and singleness of heart;

47. Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And, the Lord, was adding them who were being saved, daily, together.

## Acts 3

1. Now, Peter and John, were going up into the temple, for the hour of prayerthe ninth;

2. And, a certain man, who had been, lame from his mothers womb, was being carried,whom they used to lay daily at the door of the templethe   called Beautiful, that he might ask alms of them who were entering into the temple:

3. Who, seeing Peter and John about to enter into the temple, was requesting to receive, an alms.

4. But Peter looking steadfastly at himwith Johnsaid: Look on us!

5. And, he, gave heed unto them, expecting to receive, something from them.

6. But Peter saidSilver and gold, have none, but, what I have, the same, unto thee do give:In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, Walk!

7. And, laying hold of him by the right hand, he raised him up; and, instantly, were his feet and ankles strengthened;

8. And, leaping forward, he stood and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.

9. And all the people saw him, walking and praising God;

10. And they began to recognise him, that, the same, was he who, for the alms, used to sit at the Beautiful Gate of the temple;and they were filled with amazement and transport at what had happened unto him.

11. And, as he held fast Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them, in the portico which is called Solomons,greatly amazed.

12. And Peter, seeing it, made answer unto the people:Ye men of Israel! Why marvel ye at this man? Or, upon us, why are ye intently looking, as though, by our own power or godliness, we had made him walk?

13. The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob,the God of our fathers, hath glorified his servant Jesus:whom, ye, indeed, delivered up and denied to Pilates, face when he had adjudged to release him;

14. But, ye, denied, the Holy and Righteous One, and claimed a man that was a murderer to be granted you;

15. But, the Princely Leader of Life, ye slew:whom, God, raised from among the dead, whereof, we, are witnesses.

16. And, by the faith of his name, unto this man whom ye see and know, hath his name given strength,yea, the faith which is through him, hath given unto him this perfect soundness, over against you all!

17. And now brethren, I know that by way of ignorance ye acted,just as even your rulers.

18. Howbeit, Godwhat things he had before declared, through the mouth of all the prophets, for his Christ to suffer,did thus fulfill!

19. Repent ye, therefore, and turn,unto the blotting out of your sins; to the end that in that case, there may come seasons of refreshing from the face of the Lord,

20. And he may send forth him who had been fore-appointed for youChrist Jesus:

21. Unto whom, indeed, heaven must needs give welcome, until the times of the due establishment of all things, of which God hath spoken through the mouth of his holy age-past prophets.

22. Moses, indeed, saidA prophet, unto you, shall the Lord God raise up among your brethren, like unto me: unto him, shall ye hearken respecting all things whatsoever he shall speak unto you.

23. And it shall beevery soul, whatsoever, which shall not hearken unto that prophet, shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.

24. But, indeed, all the prophets,from Samuel and those following after, as many as have spoken, have even announced these days.

25. Ye, are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God covenanted unto your fathers, saying unto AbrahamAnd, in thy seed, shall be blessed, all the families of the ground.

26. Unto you first, Godhaving raised up his Servanthath sent him forth, ready to bless you, when ye are turning away, each one, from your wickednesses.

## Acts 4

1. But, as they were speaking unto the people, the High-priests and the Captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,

2. Being tired out because of their teaching the people, and announcing, in Jesus, the resurrection from among the dead;

3. And they thrust on them their hands, and put them in custody for the morrow, for it was evening, already.

4. Howbeit, many of them that heard the word, believed; and the number of the men became about five thousand.

5. And it came to pass, upon the morrow, that there were gathered together of them, the rulers and the elders and the scribes, in Jerusalem;

6. Also Annas, the high-priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of high-priestly descent;

7. And, setting them in the midst, they began to enquireIn what manner of power, or in what manner of name, did, ye, do this?

8. Then Peter, filled with Holy Spirit, said unto themYe rulers of the people, and elders!

9. If, we, this day, are to be examined for doing good to a sick man,in whom, this, man hath been made well,

10. Be it known unto you all, and unto all the people of Israel: that, in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene,whom, ye, crucified, whom, God, raised from among the dead, in him, doth, this man stand by, in your presence, whole.

11. This, is the stone, set at nought by you the builders, which became the head of the corner;

12. And there is in no one else, salvation, for, neither is there any other name, under heaven, which hath been set forth among men, in which we must needs be saved.

13. And, looking at Peters boldness of speech, and Johns, and having discovered that they were unlettered and obscure men, they began to marvel, recognising them also, that they had been with Jesus;

14. Seeing, the man also standing, with them, even the

15. Howbeit, ordering them to go forth outside the high-council, they began to confer one with another,

16. SayingWhat are we to do with these men? For, indeed, that a notable sign hath come to pass through their means, unto all who are dwelling in Jerusalem, is manifest, and we cannot deny   !

17. Nevertheless, lest it further spread abroad among the people, let us charge them with threats, to be no more speaking upon this name, to any soul of man.

18. And, calling them, they gave them the sweeping charge,not to be sounding aloud, nor even to be teaching, upon the name of Jesus.

19. But, Peter and John, answering, said unto themWhether it be right in presence of God, unto you, to be hearkening, rather than unto God, judge!

20. For, we, cannot but be speaking the things which we have seen and heard.

21. They, however, further charging them with threats, let them go, finding nothing as to how they might chastise them, on account of the people; because, all, were glorifying God for that which had come to pass;

22. For, more than forty years old, was the man, upon whom had taken place, this healing sign.

23. But, when they had been let go, they came unto their own   , and told as many things as, unto them, the High-priests and Elders, had said.

24. And, they, having heard, with one accord, uplifted voice unto God, and saidO Sovereign! Thou, art he that made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all things that are herein:

25. Who, by our father, through means of the Holy Spirit, even by the mouth of David thy servant, saidUnto what end did nations rage, and, peoples, busy themselves with empty things?

26. The kings of the earth stationed themselves, and, the rulers, were gathered together, with one intent, against the Lord, and against his Christ.

27. For they were gathered together, of a truth, in this city, against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou hadst anointed,both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with them of the nations, and peoples of Israel;

28. To do whatsoever, thy hand and thy counsel, marked out beforehand to come to pass.

29. As to the present things, then, O Lord,look upon their threats, and grant unto thy servants, with all freedom of utterance, to be speaking thy word,

30. By stretching forth thy hand for healing, and by the coming to pass of both signs and wonders, through the name of thy holy servant Jesus.

31. And, when they had made supplication, the place was shaken in which they were gathered together, and they were filled, one and all, with the Holy Spirit, and began speaking the word of God with freedom of utterance.

32. And, the throng of them that believed, had one heart and soul, and not so much as one was saying that, aught of his goods, was, his own, but they had all things common.

33. And, with great power, were the apostles giving forth their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus; great favour also was upon them all.

34. For there was not so much as anyone, lacking, among them; for, as many as were possessors of lands or houses, selling them, were bringing the prices of the things that were being sold,

35. And laying them at the feet of the Apostles, while on the other hand they were distributing unto each one, in so far as any one had, need.

36. And, Joseph, who had been surnamed Barnabas by the Apostles, which is to be translated Son of Exhortation,a Levite, a Cyprian by nation,

37. Having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the feet of the Apostles.

## Acts 5

1. But, a certain man, Ananias by name, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,

2. And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it; and, bringing a certain part, at the feet of the Apostles, he laid it.

3. But Peter saidAnanias! wherefore did Satan fill thy heart, that thou shouldst deal falsely with the Holy Spirit, and keep back part of the price of the field?

4. While it remained, was it not, as thine own, it remained? and, when sold, was it not, in thine own authority, that it still continued? Why was it that thou didst contrive in thy heart this deed? Thou hast not dealt falsely with men but, with God.

5. And, as Ananias heard these words, he fell, and expired. And there came great fear upon all that heard;

6. But the young men, rising up, wrapped him about, and, bearing him forth, buried him.

7. And it came to pass, after about three hours interval, that his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.

8. And Peter began to say unto herTell me! was it, for so much, ye gave up the field? And she saidYea! for so much.

9. And, Peter,   unto herWhy was it agreed by you to put to the proof the Spirit of the Lord? Lo! the feet of them that have buried thy husband, are at the door, and they shall bear thee forth.

10. And she fell instantly at his feet, and expired. And the young men, coming in, found her dead; and, bearing her forth, they buried her with her husband.

11. And there came great fear upon the whole assembly, and upon all them that heard these things.

12. And, through the hands of the Apostles, were coming to pass many signs and wonders among the people; and they were all with one accord in the portico of Solomon;

13. Howbeit, of the rest, no one, durst join himself unto them,nevertheless the people continued to magnify them;

14. And, the more, were being added, when they believed in the Lord, throngs both of men and women;

15. So that, even into the broad-ways, were they bringing forth the sick, and laying them on small couches and beds, in order that, if Peter were coming along, even perchance his shadow, might overshadow some one of them.

16. Moreover even the throng of the cities all round Jerusalem was coming together, bearing sick folk, and such as were harassed by impure spirits,who, indeed, were being cured, one and all.

17. But the High-priest, arising, and all who were with him,being the sect of the Sadducees,were filled with jealousy,

18. And thrust their hands upon the Apostles, and put them in a public ward.

19. But, a messenger of the Lord, by night, opened the doors of the prison; and, leading them out, said

20. Be going your way, and, taking your stand, be speaking, in the temple, unto the people, all the declarations of this Life.

21. Now, when they heard this, they entered, under the dawn, into the temple, and began teaching. And the High-priest and they who were with him, arriving, called together the high-council, and all the senate of the sons of Israel; and sent off unto the prison, to have them brought.

22. And, the officers who came to the place, found them not in the prison; and, returning, brought tidings,

23. SayingThe prison, found we locked with all safety, and the keepers standing at the doors; but, when we had opened the prison, inside, found we, no one.

24. Now, when both the captain of the temple and the High-priests heard these words, they were utterly at a loss concerning themwhat perhaps this might come to.

25. But some one, entering, brought tidings unto themLo! the men whom ye put in the prison, are in the temple, standing, and teaching the people!

26. Then, the captain with the officers, departing, brought themnot with violence,for they were afraid of the people, lest they should be stoned;

27. But, leading them in, set them in the high- council. And the High-priest questioned them,

28. SayingStrictly, did we charge you not to be teaching upon this name; and lo! ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and are minded to bring down upon us, the blood of this man.

29. But Peter and the Apostles, answering, saidIt is needful to be yielding obedience unto God rather than unto men:

30. The God of our fathers, hath raised up Jesus,whom, ye, got into your hands, suspending him upon a tree:

31. Him, as Princely-leader and Saviour, hath God exalted unto his right hand,to give repentance unto Israel, and remission of sins.

32. And, we, are witnesses of these things,also the Holy Spirit, which God hath given unto them who are yielding obedience unto him.

33. And, they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart, and were making up their minds to slay them.

34. But a certain man, rising up in the high-council, by name Gamaliel, a law-teacher honoured by all the people, gave orders to put the men, outside, for a little,

35. And said unto themMen of Israel! be taking heed unto yourselves, what ye are about to inflict upon these men.

36. For, before these days, there rose up one Theudas, affirming, himself, to be somebody,unto whom was inclined a number of men, about four hundred; who was slain, and, all as many as had been trusting in him, were disbanded, and came to nothing.

37. After him, rose up Judas the Galilaean, in the days of the enrolling, and drew a people into revolt after him; and, he, perished, and, all, as many as had trusted in him, were scattered.

38. Now, therefore, I say unto youstand aloof from these men, and let them alone; because if, of men, be this project or this work, it will be overthrown,

39. But, if it is, of God, ye will not be able to overthrow them: lest once, even fighters against God, ye be found.

40. And they were persuaded by him; and, calling unto them the Apostles, they, with beating, charged them not be speaking upon the name of Jesus; and let them go.

41. They, therefore, went rejoicing from the presence of the high-council; in that they had been accounted worthy, in behalf of The Name, to suffer dishonour.

42. And, every day in the temple, and at home, they ceased not to be teaching, and telling the good news as to the Anointed Jesus.

## Acts 6

1. But, in these days, the disciples, multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Grecian Jews against the Hebrews, in that, their widows, were being overlooked in the daily ministry.

2. And the Twelve, calling near the throng of the disciples, saidIt doth not seem, right, that, we, forsaking the word of God, should be ministering unto tables.

3. But look out for yourselves, brethren, seven men from among you, who can be well-attested, full of Spirit and wisdom,whom we will appoint over this need;

4. But, we, unto prayer and unto the ministry of the word, will give constant attention.

5. And the word was pleasing in the sight of all the throng; and they selected Stephen, a man full of faith and Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicholaus, a proselyte of Antioch;

6. Whom they set before the Apostles, and, praying, they laid upon them their hands.

7. And, the word of God, went on growing, and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem continued to multiply exceedingly; a great multitude of the priests also, were becoming obedient unto the faith.

8. Now, Stephen, full of favour and power, began to do great wonders and signs among the people.

9. But there rose up certain of those out of the synagogue which is called   of them of Libertium and Cyrene and Alexandria, and certain of them from Cilicia and Asia,disputing with Stephen;

10. And they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking,

11. Then, they set on men who were sayingWe have heard him speaking profane things against Moses and God.

12. And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes; and, coming upon him, they caught him away, and led him into the high-council.

13. And they set up false witnesses, who saidThis man, ceaseth not speaking things against this holy place and the law;

14. For we have heard him sayingThis Jesus the Nazarene, will overthrow this place, and will change the customs which, Moses, delivered unto us.

15. And, looking steadfastly at him, all they who were sitting in the high-council, saw his face, as if the face of a messenger;

## Acts 7

1. And the High-priest saidAre these things, so?

2. And, he, saidBrethren and fathers, hearken! The God of Glory, appeared unto our father Abraham, while he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,

3. And said unto himGet thee forth, out of thy land, and from among thy kindred, and come unto the land which, unto thee, I will point out.

4. Then, coming forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, he dwelt in Haran; and, from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, in which, ye, now dwell;

5. And gave him no inheritance therein, not even a place to set his foot on; and yet promised to give it unto him in possession, and unto his seed after him, when as yet he had not a child.

6. But God, spake thusHis seed shall be a sojourner in a foreign land, and they will bring it into bondage, and ill-treat it four-hundred years;

7. And, the nation unto which they shall be in bondage, will, I, judgesaid God; and, after these things, shall they come forth, and render divine service unto me, in this place.

8. And he gave unto him a covenant of circumcision; and, thus, he begat Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day, and Isaac, Jacob, and Jacob, the twelve patriarchs.

9. And, the patriarchs, being jealous of Joseph, gave him up into Egypt; and, God, was, with him,

10. And rescued him out of all his tribulations, and gave him favour and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he appointed him governor over Egypt and all his house.

11. And there came a famine upon all Egypt and Canaan, and great tribulation, and our fathers could not find pasture.

12. But Jacob, hearing there was corn in Egypt, sent off our fathers, first;

13. And, the second time, Joseph was made known unto his brethren, and, the race of Joseph was made, manifest, unto Pharaoh.

14. And Joseph, sending forth, called for Jacob his father, and all the kindred, consisting of seventy-five souls;

15. And Jacob went down  into Egypt . And he died, he, and our fathers;

16. And were brought over into Shechem, and laid in the tomb which Abraham had purchased, for a price of silver, of the sons of Hamor in Shechem.

17. Now, just as the time of the promise was drawing near wherewith God had agreed with Abraham, the people grew, and were multiplied in Egypt,

18. Until there arose another sort of king over Egypt, who had not known Joseph.

19. The same, dealing craftily with our race, ill-treated our fathers, so as to cause their babes to be exposed, to the end they might not be suffered to live.

20. In which season, Moses, was born, and was exceeding goodly,who was nourished up three months in the house of his father;

21. But, when he was exposed, the daughter of Pharaoh rescued him, and nourished him for herself, as a son.

22. And, so Moses was trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in his words and works.

23. And, when there was being fulfilled unto him a period of forty years, it came up on his heart to look after his brethren the sons of Israel;

24. And, seeing one being wronged, he defended him, and avenged him that was getting worn out, smiting the Egyptian.

25. But he supposed his brethren would understand that, God, through his hand, would give them deliverance; whereas they understood not.

26. On the following day also, he appeared unto them, as they were contending, and would have reconciled them in peace, sayingMen! ye are, brothers! Wherefore wrong ye one another?

27. But, he that was wronging his neighbour, thrust him away, sayingWho hath appointed, thee, to be ruler and judge over us?

28. Art, thou, wishing, to kill me, in the same way thou didst kill, yesterday, the Egyptian?

29. And Moses fled at this saying, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons.

30. And, when forty years were fulfilled, there appeared unto him, in the desert of Mount Sinai, a messenger, in a flame of fire, in a bush.

31. And, Moses, seeing it, marvelled at the sight; and, as he was going near to observe, there came a voice of the Lord

32. I, am the God of thy fathers, The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. And Moses becoming, terrified, durst not observe.

33. And the Lord said unto himLoose the sandals of thy feet; for, the place whereon thou art standing, is, hallowed ground.

34. I have, indeed seen, the ill-treatment of my people that is in Egypt, and, unto their groaning, have I hearkened, and have come down to rescue them. Now, therefore, come! I will send thee into Egypt.

35. The same Moses whom they had refused, sayingWho hath appointed thee to be ruler and judge? the same, both as ruler and redeemer, did God send, by the hand of the messenger who had appeared unto him in the bush:

36. The same, led them forth, doing wonders and signs in Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the desert, forty years:

37. The same, is the Moses that said unto the sons of IsraelA prophet, unto you, will God raise up, from among your brethren, like unto me:

38. The same, is he that came to be in the assembly in the desert, with the messenger who was speaking with him in Mount Sinai, and with our fathers, he who welcomed living utterances, to give unto us:

39. Unto whom, our fathers would not become obedient, but thrust him away, and turned in their hearts unto Egypt,

40. Saying unto AaronMake as gods who shall go before us; for, as for this Moses who brought us forth out of Egypt, we know not what hath befallen him!

41. And so they fell to calf-making in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.

42. But God, turned, and delivered them up to be doing divine service unto the host of heaven,just as it is written in a book of the prophetsVictims and sacrifices did ye offer unto me, forty years in the desert, O house of Israel?

43. Nay! but ye took with you the tent of Moloch, and the star of the god Rephan,the forms which ye made to bow down unto them: therefore will I carry you away beyond Babylon.

44. The tent of witness, was with our fathers in the desert, according as he who was speaking unto Moses, gave instructions, to make it, according to the model which he had seen.

45. Which our fathers succeeding to, also brought in, with Joshua, when taking possession of the nations, which God put out from before our fathers until the days of David;

46. Who found favour before God, and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob.

47. But, Solomon, built him a house.

48. Although indeed, the Most High, not in hand-made places, dwelleth; just as, the prophet, saith

49. Heaven is my thrown, and, the earth, is my footstool: What manner of house, will ye build me, saith the Lord,Or what shall be the place of my resting?

50. Hath not, my hand, made all these things?

51. Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in hearts and in ears, ye, always, against the Holy Spirit, do strive! As your fathers, ye also:

52. Which of the prophets, did not your fathers persecute? Yea they slew them who declared beforehand concerning the coming of the Righteous Oneof whom, now, ye, have become, betrayers and murderers!

53. Who, indeed, received the law through ranks of messengers,and guarded it not.

54. And, while they were hearing these things, they were being pierced in their hearts, and began gnashing their teeth against him.

55. But he, being already full of Holy Spirit, looking steadfastly into heaven, saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God;

56. And saidLo! I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man, standing, on the right hand of God.

57. And, crying out with a loud voice, they held their ears, and rushed with one accord upon him;

58. And, thrusting him forth outside the city, proceeded to stone him. And, the witnesses, laid their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.

59. And they stoned Stephen, as he was invoking and sayingLord Jesus! give welcome unto my spirit.

60. And, kneeling down, he cried out with a loud voiceLord! do not charge against them, this sin. And, having said this, he fell asleep.

## Acts 8

1. And, Saul, was taking pleasure with them in his death. Moreover there arose, in that day, a great persecution against the assembly which was in Jerusalem;  and , all, were scattered abroad throughout the countries of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.

2. Howbeit reverent men assisted at the burial of Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.

3. But, Saul, went on to lay waste the assembly, along the houses, going in, and, dragging off both men and women, was

4. They, indeed, therefore, who were scattered abroad, passed through, telling the good-news of the word;

5. And, Philip, going down unto the city of Samaria, proclaimed unto them the Christ.

6. And the multitudes began to give heed unto the things that were being spoken by Philip, with one accord, when they heard him, and saw the signs which he was working.

7. For, from many who had impure spirits, shouting with a loud voice, they were going out, and, many that were paralysed and lame, were cured.

8. And there came to be great joy in that city.

9. But, a certain man named Simon, was already in the city, practising magical arts, and astonishing the nation of Samaria,saying that himself was someone great:

10. Unto whom all were giving heed, from small even to great, sayingThis, is the Power of God, which is called Great.

11. And they were giving heed to him, because that, for a considerable time, with his magical arts, he had astonished them.

12. But, when they believed Philip telling the good news concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they proceeded to be immersed, both men and women.

13. And, Simon himself also, believed; and, having been immersed, was in constant attendance on Philip,and, beholding signs and great works of power coming to pass, was astonished.

14. And the Apostles who were in Jerusalem, hearing that Samaria had welcomed the word of God, sent out unto them Peter and John;

15. Who, indeed, going down, prayed for them, that they might receive Holy Spirit;

16. For, not yet, had it, upon any one of them, fallen, but, only, to begin with, they had been immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus.

17. Then, proceeded they to lay their hands upon them, and they were receiving Holy Spirit.

18. But Simon, seeing that, through means of the laying on of the hands of the Apostles, the Spirit was being given, offered unto them money,

19. SayingGive unto me also this authority,in order that, on whomsoever may lay my hands, he may receive Holy Spirit.

20. And Peter said unto himThy silver, with thee, go to destruction! Because, the free-gift of God, thou didst suppose could, with money, be obtained!

21. Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter; for, thy heart, is not upright before God.

22. Repent, therefore, from this thy baseness, and entreat of the Lordwhether, after all, the purpose of thy heart shall be forgiven thee;

23. For see that thou servest as a gall-root of bitterness, and a bond of unrighteousness.

24. And Simon, answering, saidEntreat ye, in my behalf, unto the Lord; that, nothing, may come upon me, of the things whereof ye have spoken!

25. They, therefore, having fully borne witness, and spoken the word of the Lord, began their return unto Jerusalem, and, unto many villages of the Samaritans, were they telling the glad tidings.

26. And, a messenger of the Lord, spake unto Philip, sayingArise, and be journeying along southward, unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza,the same, is desert.

27. And, arising, he journeyed. And lo! a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch, one in power under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure  who  had come to worship in Jerusalem;

28. And was returning, and, sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.

29. And the Spirit said unto PhilipGo near, and join thyself unto this chariot!

30. And, running near, Philip heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and saidDost thou, then, understand what thou art reading?

31. And, he, saidHow indeed should be ableunless someone shall guide me? And he called upon Philip, to come up and sit with him.

32. Now, the passage of Scripture which he was reading, was, this:As a sheep, unto slaughter, was he led, and, as a lamb, before him that sheareth it, is dumb, so, he openeth not his mouth.

33. In his humiliation, his judgment was taken away,his generation, who shall describe? because, his life, is taken away from the earth.

34. And the eunuch, making answer unto Philip, saidI pray thee! Of whom, is the prophet saying this? of himself, or, of some different person?

35. And Philip, opening his mouth, and beginning from this scripture, told him the glad tidings of Jesus.

36. And, as they were journeying along the way, they came unto a certain water,and the eunuch saithLo! water! What doth hinder my being immersed?

38. And he commanded the chariot to stand still; and they went down, both, into the water, both Philip and the eunuch,and he immersed him.

39. But, when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more; for he was going on his way rejoicing.

40. Now Philip was found at Azotus; and, passing through, he was telling the glad tidings unto all the cities, until he came unto Caesarea.

## Acts 9

1. But, Saul, yet breathing threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, going unto the High-priest,

2. asked from him letters for Damascus, unto the synagogues; to the end that, if he should find, any, who were of The Way, whether men or women, he might bring them, bound, unto Jerusalem.

3. But, as he was journeying, it came to pass that he was drawing near unto Damascus, and, suddenly, there flashed around him a light out of heaven;

4. And, falling unto the earth, he heard a voice saying unto himSaul! Saul! why, me, art thou persecuting?

5. And he saidWho art thou, Lord? And, he,   I, am Jesus, whom, thou, art persecuting!

6. But rise up, and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.

7. But, the men who were accompanying him, stood speechless,hearing, indeed, the voice, but beholding no one.

8. And Saul arose from the earth, and, his eyes being opened, he could see nothing; and, taking him by the hand, they led him into Damascus,

9. And he was three days without seeing, and did neither eat nor drink.

10. Now there was a certain disciple in Damascus, by name Ananias; and, the Lord, said unto him in a visionAnanias! And, he, saidLo! I,   , Lord!

11. And the Lord   unto himRise! go into the street which is called Straight, and seek, in the house of Judas, one Saul, by name, of Tarsus. For lo! he is praying,

12. And hath seen a man  in a vision , Ananias by name, coming in and laying on him his hands, to the intent he should see.

13. And Ananias, answeredLord! I have heard from many concerning this man, how many evil things unto thy saints he hath done in Jerusalem;

14. And, here, he hath authority from the High-priests to bind all them that call upon thy name.

15. But the Lord said unto himBe going thy way; for, a choice vessel unto me, is this man, to bear my name before both  the  nations and kings, and the sons of Israel;

16. For, I, will let him understand how many things he must needs, for my name, suffer.

17. And Ananias departed, and entered into the house; and, laying upon him his hands, saidSaul, brother! The Lord, hath sent me,Jesus, who appeared unto thee in the way by which thou wast coming,that thou mayest recover sight, and be filled with Holy Spirit.

18. And, straightway, there fell from himfrom his eyes,as it were scales; he recovered sight also, and, arising, was immersed:

19. And, receiving food, gained strength. And he came to be with the disciples who were in Damascus certain days;

20. And, straightway, in the synagogues, he began proclaiming Jesus, that, This, is the Son of God.

21. And all who were hearing were astonished, and began to sayis not, this, he who destroyed, in Jerusalem, them that invoke this name; and, here, for this purpose, had come, in order that he might lead them, bound, unto the High-priests?

22. But, Saul, was the more gaining power; and was confounding the Jews who dwelt in Damascus, shewing, by comparison, thatThis, is the Christ.

23. Now, when a considerable number of days were being fulfilled, the Jews took counsel together to kill him;

24. But their plot was made known unto Saul,and they were even narrowly watching the gates, both day and night, that they might kill him;

25. But the disciples, taking him by night, through the wall, let him down, lowering him in a basket.

26. And, when he had arrived in Jerusalem, he made attempts to join himself unto the disciples; and all were afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.

27. But, Barnabas, taking him, brought him unto the apostles, and related unto them,how, in the way, he had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken unto him; and how, in Damascus, he had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus.

28. And he was with them, coming in and going out in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord;

29. And was both speaking and discussing with the Grecian Jews,but, they, were setting to work to kill him.

30. And the brethren, discovering it, brought him down into Caesarea, and sent him away unto Tarsus.

31. So then, the assembly throughout the whole of Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, had peace, building itself up, and going on its way in the fear of the Lord; and, by the advocacy of the Holy Spirit, was being multiplied.

32. And it came to pass that, Peter, going through all   went down unto the saints also dwelling in Lydda.

33. And he found there a certain man, by name Aeneas, who, for eight years, had been lying prostrate upon a bed, for he was paralysed.

34. And Peter said unto himAeneas! Jesus Christ healeth thee! Arise, and smooth thy bed for thyself. And, straightway, he arose.

35. And all who dwelt in Lydda and Saron, saw him,and, they, turned unto the Lord.

36. Now, in Joppa, there was a certain female disciple, by name Tabitha, which, being translated, means Dorcas   . The same, was full of good works and alms which she was doing.

37. And it came to pass in those days, that she, sickening, died; and, bathing her, they laid her in an upper room.

38. Now, Lydda being nigh unto Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was therein, sent off two men unto him, beseeching himDo not delay to come through unto us!

39. And Peter, arising, went with them,whom, when he arrived, they brought up into the upper room; and there stood by him all the widows, weeping, and showing the tunics and mantleswhatsoever things Dorcas was making while she was with them.

40. But Peter, putting them all outside, knelt down and prayed; and, turning towards the body, saidTabitha, arise! And she, opening her eyes and seeing Peter, sat up.

41. And, giving her his hand, he raised her up; and, calling the saints and the widows, presented her, living.

42. And it became known throughout the whole of Joppa, and many believed upon the Lord.

43. And it came to pass that, for a considerable number of days, he abode in Joppa, with one Simon, a tanner.

## Acts 10

1. But, a certain man in Caesarea, by name Cornelius, a centurion of the band called Italian,

2. Devout, and fearing God with all his house, doing many alms unto the people, and supplicating God continually,

3. Saw, in a vision, manifestly, as if about the ninth hour of the day, a messenger of God, coming in unto him, and saying unto himCornelius!

4. And he, looking steadfastly at him, and becoming full of fear, saidWhat is it, Lord? And he said unto himThy prayers and thine alms, have gone up for a memorial before God.

5. Now, therefore, send men unto Joppa, and fetch one Simon who is surnamed Peter,

6. The same is a guest with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea.

7. And, when the messenger who had been speaking with him had departed, calling two of the domestics, and a devout soldier of them that constantly attended him,

8. And relating everything unto them, he sent them off unto Joppa.

9. Now, on the morrow, as those men were journeying, and, unto the city, drawing near, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour;

10. But he became hungry, and wished to eat,and, while they were making ready, there came upon him a trance;

11. And he beholdeth heaven opened, and, corning down, a kind of vessel, like a large linen cloth, by its four corners, being let down upon the earth,

12. In which were all the quadrupeds and creeping things of earth and birds of heaven.

13. And there came a voice unto himRise, Peter! slay and eat.

14. But Peter saidBy no means, Lord! because, at no time, have I eaten anything common or unclean.

15. And a voice   again, a second time, unto himWhat things, God, hath cleansed, be not, thou, making common.

16. Now, this, took place thrice; and, straightway, was the vessel taken up into heaven.

17. And, as within himself Peter was doubting what the vision which he had seen might mean, lo! the men who had been sent by Cornelius, having sought out the house of Simon, stood at the gate,

18. And, calling, enquired whether, Simon who was surnamed Peter, was there being entertained.

19. And, as Peter was pondering over the vision, the Spirit saidLo! two men, seeking thee.

20. But rise, go down, and be journeying with them, nothing, doubting; because, I, have sent them.

21. And Peter, going down unto the men, saidLo! I, am he whom ye are seeking: What is the cause, for which ye are come?

22. And they saidCornelius, a centurion, a man righteous and fearing God, well-attested by the whole nation of the Jews, hath been divinely instructed by a holy messenger to send for thee unto his house, and to hear words from thee.

23. Inviting them in, therefore, he entertained them; but, on the morrow, he rose up and went forth with them, and certain of the brethren who were from Joppa went with him;

24. And, on the morrow, he entered into Caesarea. And, Cornelius, was expecting them, having called together his kinsfolk and intimate friends.

25. And, when it came about that Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and, falling at his feet, did homage.

26. But, Peter, raised him up, sayingArise! I also myself, am, a man.

27. And, conversing with him, he went in, and findeth many come together;

28. And said unto theYe, well know, how unlawful it is, for, a Jew, to be joining himself or coming in unto one of another race. And yet, unto me, hath God pointed out that I should be calling no man, common or unclean.

29. Wherefore, even without gainsaying, came I when sent for. I ask, therefore, for what reason ye sent for me.

30. And Cornelius saidFour days ago, counting unto this very hour, I was keeping, the ninth hour, as one of prayer, in my house. And lo! a man stood before me, in bright clothing,

31. And saithCornelius! thy prayer hath been heard, and, thine alms, have been remembered before God.

32. Send, therefore, unto Joppa, and fetch Simon, who is surnamed Peter. The same is being entertained in the house of one Simon a tanner, by the sea.

33. Immediately, therefore, I sent unto thee: Thou, also hast, well, done in coming. Now, therefore, all we, before God are present, to hear all things that have been enjoined upon thee by the Lord.

34. And Peter, opening his mouth, saidOf a truth, I find that God is no respecter of persons;

35. But, in every nation, he that feareth him and worketh righteousness, is acceptable unto him.

36. As touching the word he hath sent unto the sons of Israel, announcing the glad tidings of peace through Jesus Christthe same, is Lord, of all,

37. Ye yourselves, know what hath come to pass throughout the whole of Judaea, beginning from Galilee, after the immersion which John proclaimed, respecting Jesus who was of Nazareth:

38. How God anointed him with Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the adversary, because, God, was with him.

39. We also, are witnesses of all things which he did, both in the country of the Jews and Jerusalem; whom they even slew by suspending upon a tree;

40. The same, God raised up on the third day, and gave him to become, manifest,

41. Not unto all the people, but unto witnesses who had been fore-appointed by God, unto us, who, indeed, did eat and drink with him after his rising from among the dead.

42. And he charged us to proclaim unto the people, and bear full witness, thatThis, is he that hath been marked out by God to be judge of living and dead.

43. Unto the same, do all the prophets bear witness, That, remission of sins, is to be received through his name, by every one that believeth on him.

44. While Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who were hearing the word.

45. And the faithful, of the circumcision, who had come with Peter, were amazed,in that, upon the nations also, the free-gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out;

46. For they heard them speaking with tongues, and magnifying God. Then answered Peter

47. Surely then, the water, can no man forbid, that these should not be immersed,seeing that, the Holy Spirit, they have received, as well as we.

48. And he commanded them in the name of Jesus Christ to be immersed. Then, requested they him, to abide still some days.

## Acts 11

1. Now the Apostles and the brethren who were throughout Judaea heard that, the nations also, had welcomed the word of God.

2. And, when Peter came up unto Jerusalem, they of the circumcision began to find fault with him,

3. Sayinghe went in unto men uncircumcised, and did eat with them.

4. But Peter, making a beginning, went on to set forth the matter unto them in order, saying

5. I was in the city of Joppa praying, and saw in a trance, a vision:coming down a sort of vessel, like a large sheet, by four corners, being let down out of heaven, and it came even unto me:

6. Into which steadfastly looking, began to observe, and saw the quadrupeds of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the birds of heaven.

7. Moreover heard a voice also, saying unto meRise, Peter! slay and eat.

8. But I saidBy no means, Lord, because, a common or unclean thing, hath at no time entered into my mouth.

9. And a voice answered, a second time, out of heavenWhat things, God, hath cleansed, be not, thou, making common.

10. And, this, took place thrice,and the whole was drawn up again into heaven;

11. And lo! immediately, three men halted at the house wherein we were, sent from Caesarea unto me.

12. And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. And there went with me these six brethren also; and we entered into the house of the man,

13. And he related to us how he had seen the messenger in his house, standing, and sayingSend away unto Joppa, and fetch Simon, who is surnamed Peter;

14. Who shall speak words unto thee, whereby thou shall be saved, thou, and all thy house.

15. And, as I began to be speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, just as upon us also at the beginning.

16. And I was put in mind of the word of the Lord, how he used to sayJohn, indeed, immersed with water; but, ye, shall be immersed in Holy Spirit.

17. If therefore the like free-gift God gave unto them, as even unto us, when we had believed upon the Lord Jesus Christ, who was, I, that could withstand God?

18. And, having heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, sayingHence, even unto the nations, God hath granted repentance unto life.

19. They, therefore, who had been scattered abroad by reason of the tribulation that took place on account of Stephen, passed through as far as Phoenice and Cyprus and Antioch, unto no one speaking the word, save alone unto Jews.

20. And there were some from among them, Cyprians and Cyrenians, who, indeed, coming unto Antioch, began speaking, even unto the Grecian Jews, announcing the glad tidings as to the Lord Jesus;

21. And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great numberthey who believedturned unto the Lord.

22. And the matter was reported in the hearing of the assembly that was in Jerusalem, concerning them; and they sent forth Barnabas, as far as Antioch;

23. Who, arriving, and seeing the favour which was of God, rejoiced, and went on to beseech all, with the purpose of their heart, to abide  in  the Lord;

24. Because he was a good man, and full of Holy Spirit and faith; and a considerable multitude were added unto the Lord.

25. He went away, however, unto Tarsus, to seek up Saul;

26. And, finding him, he brought him unto Antioch. And so it was with them, that, for a whole year, they were brought together in the assembly, and taught a considerable multitude; also that the disciples, first in Antioch, were called, Christians.

27. Now, in these days, there came down from Jerusalem, prophets, unto Antioch.

28. And one from among them, by name Agabus, rising up, gave a sign, through means of the Spirit, that, a great famine, was coming over all the inhabited earth; which, indeed, came to pass under Claudius.

29. And, according as any one of the disciples was being prospered, they each one of them set apart   for ministering, to send unto the brethren, who dwelt in Jerusalem;

30. Which thing they also did, sending it unto the Elders, through the hand of Barnabas and Saul.

## Acts 12

1. Now, in the course of that season, Herod the king thrust forth his hands to harm some of them of the assembly,

2. And slew James the brother with a sword;

3. And, seeing that it was acceptable unto the Jews, he went on to apprehend Peter also (now they were the days of unleavened bread),

4. Whom also having seized, he put into prison, delivering him up unto four quaternions of soldiers, to be guarding him,intending, after the passover, to bring him up unto the people.

5. Peter, therefore, was kept in the prison; but, prayer, was, earnestly, being made by the assembly, unto God, concerning him.

6. And, when Herod was about to bring him forth, on that night, was Peter sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, guards, also, before the door, were keeping the prison.

7. And lo! a messenger of the Lord stood over him, and a light shone in the cell; and, smiting the side of Peter, he roused him up, sayingRise up quickly! And his chains fell off out of his hands.

8. And the messenger said unto himGird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And he did so. And he saith unto himThrow around thee thy mantle, and be following me.

9. And, coming out, he began following, and knew not that it was true which was coming about through means of the messenger; but supposed that, a vision, he was beholding.

10. And, passing through the first ward and the second, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth into the city, the which, of its own accord, opened unto them; and, coming out, they went on through one street, and, straightway, the messenger was parted from him.

11. And, Peter, coming to himself saidNow, know I, of a truth, that the Lord hath sent forth his messenger, and taken me out of the hand of Herod, and all the expectation of the people of the Jews.

12. And, considering the matter, he came unto the house of Mary, the mother who was surnamed Mark, where a considerable number were gathered together and praying.

13. And, when he had knocked at the door of the porch, there came unto it a maiden to hearken, by name Rhoda;

14. And, recognizing the voice of Peter, by reason of her joy, she opened not the porch,but, running in, bare tidings that Peter was standing before the porch. But, they, unto her, saidThou art raving

15. She, however, kept on strongly declaring that, so, it was. But, they, were sayingIt is his, messenger.

16. And, Peter, continued knocking; and, opening, they saw him, and were amazed.

17. But, making a sign to them with his hand to hold their peace, he related to them how, the Lord, had brought, him, forth out of the prison; and he saidCarry tidings unto James and the brethren, as to these things. And, going out, he went his way unto some other place.

18. And, when it became day, there was no small commotion among the soldiers, as to what, then, Peter had become!

19. And, Herod, seeking after and not finding, him, having examined the guards, ordered them to be led away

20. Now he was bitterly hostile to them of Tyre and Zidon; but, with one accord, they came unto him, and, persuading Blastus, who was over the bed-chamber of the king, they were suing for peace; because their country was fed by the kings,

21. And, on an appointed day, Herod, putting on royal apparel, and seating himself upon the tribunal, proceeded to deliver an oration unto them.

22. And, the populace, began to shoutA gods, voice, and not, a mans!

23. And, instantly, there smote him, a messenger of the Lord, because he gave not the glory unto God; and, becoming worm-eaten, he expired.

24. And, the word of the Lord, went on growing and multiplying.

25. And, Barnabas and Saul, returned unto Jerusalem, fulfilling the ministering, taking with them John who was surnamed Mark.

## Acts 13

1. Now there were in Antioch, distributed through the existing assembly,prophets and teachers: both Barnabas and Symeon who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, Manaen also, Herod the tetrarchs foster-brother, and Saul.

2. And, as they were publicly ministering unto the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit saidSeparate forthwith unto me, Barnabas and Saul, unto the work whereunto I have called them.

3. Then, fasting and praying, and laying their hands upon them, they sent them away.

4. They, therefore, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down unto Seleucia, and, from thence, sailed away unto Cyprus;

5. And, coming to be in Salamis, they declared the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews;and they had, John also, as an attendant.

6. And, passing through the whole island, as far as Paphos, they found a certain man, a magician, a false-prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus;

7. Who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. The same, calling for Barnabas and Saul, sought to hear the word of God.

8. But Elymas the magician,for so, when translated, is his name,withstood them; seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith.

9. But Saul, who is also Paul, filled with Holy Spirit, looking steadfastly at him,

10. SaidO full of all guile, and all recklessness! Son of an adversary! Enemy of all righteousness!Wilt thou not cease to pervert the straight ways of the Lord?

11. Now, therefore, lo! the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun, until a fitting time. And, instantly, there fell upon him a mist and darkness; and, going about, he was seeking such as might lead him by the hand.

12. Then, the proconsul, seeing what had happened, believed, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.

13. And, setting sail from Paphos, Pauls company came into Perga of Pamphylia; but, John, withdrawing from them, returned unto Jerusalem.

14. They, however, passing through from Perga, arrived at Antioch of Pisidia; and, going into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, sat down.

15. And, after the reading of the law and the prophets, the synagogue-rulers sent unto them, sayingBrethren! if there is in you a word of exhortation unto the people, say on.

16. And Paul, standing up, and making a sign with his hand, saidYe men of Israel! and such as revere God! hearken:

17. The God of this people Israel, chose our fathers, and, the people, he exalted, by their sojourn in the land of Egypt,and, with a high arm, brought he them out of it;

18. And, for the time of about forty years, bare with their manners in the desert;

19. And, overthrowing seven nations in the land of Canaan, gave them their land as an inheritanceabout four hundred and fifty years.

20. And, after these things, he gave them judges, until Samuel the prophet.

21. And, from that time, they asked for themselves a king, and God gave them Saul, son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, during forty years;

22. And, setting him aside, raised up, David, unto them for king,of whom he also said, bearing witnessI have found David, the son of Jesse, a man  according to my heart, who will do all my will.

23. From this mans seed, hath God, according to promise, brought unto Israel, a saviourJesus:

24. John, beforehand proclaiming, before the face of his coming in, an immersion of repentance, unto all the people of Israel.

25. And, as John was fulfilling his course, he was sayingWhom are ye supposing that I am? I, am not he! But lo! there cometh, after me, one of whom I am not worthy, the sandals of his feet, to loosen.

26. Brethren! sons of the race of Abraham, and those who among you revere God,unto you, hath this word of salvation been sent forth.

27. For, they who were dwelling in Jerusalem, and their rulers, not recognising him, have, by judging him, fulfilled, the very voices of the prophets which every sabbath are being read;

28. And, though no single cause of death they found, yet claimed they of Pilate that he should be slain.

29. And, when they had finished all those things which, concerning him, had been written, taking him down from the tree, they put him in a tomb.

30. But, God, raised him from among the dead:

31. Who appeared, during many days, unto them who had come up with him from Galilee unto Jerusalem; who, indeed,  now  are his witnesses unto the people.

32. We, therefore, unto you, bring the good news, as to the promise which, unto our fathers, was made,

33. That God hath fulfilled, the same, for our children, by raising up Jesus: as also, in the second psalm, it is writtenMy son, art, thou: I, this day, have begotten thee.

34. And, in that he raised him from among the dead, no more destined to return unto corruption, on this wise hath he spokenI will give unto you the faithful lovingkindnesses of David.

35. Wherefore also, in a different   , he saithThou wilt not give thy man of lovingkindness to see corruption.

36. For, David, indeed, unto his own generation having done service, by the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was added unto fathers, and saw corruption;

37. But, he whom God hath raised, did not see corruption.

38. Be it known unto you, therefore, brethren,that, through this man, unto you, remission of sins is declared;

39. And, from all things from which ye could not, by the law of Moses, be justified, by this man, everyone that believeth, is justified.

40. Be taking heed, therefore, lest that come upon you which hath been spoken in the prophets

41. See, ye despisers, and marvel, and disappear: in that, a work, am, I, working in your days,a work, which in nowise will ye believe, though one relate it in full unto you.

42. And, as they were going out, they kept on beseeching that, on the ensuing sabbath, might be spoken unto them these things.

43. And, when the congregation was broken up, there followed many of the Jews, and of the devout proselytes, with Paul and Barnabas; who, indeed, in speaking unto them, went on persuading them to abide in the favour of God.

44. And, on the coming sabbath, almost all the city, was gathered together, to hear the word of God.

45. But, the Jews, seeing, the multitudes, were filled with jealousy,and began speaking against the things which, by Paul, were being spoken, defaming them.

46. And Paul and Barnabas, speaking boldly, saidUnto you, was it necessary, that the word of God should first be spoken: seeing ye are thrusting it from you, and, unworthy, are judging yourselves of the age-abiding life, lo! we turn unto the nations;

47. For so hath the Lord commanded usI have set thee for a light of nations, that thou mayest be for salvation unto the end of the earth.

48. And they of the nations, hearing   , began to rejoice, and to be glorifying God, and they believedas many as had become disposed for life age-abiding.

49. And the word of the Lord went on to be carried through the whole country.

50. But, the Jews, urged on the devout women of the higher class, and the chief men of the city, and roused up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas,and thrust them out from their bounds.

51. But they, shaking off the dust of their feet against them, came into Iconium.

52. And, the disciples, were filled with joy, and with Holy Spirit.

## Acts 14

1. And it came to pass in Iconium that they together entered into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake that there believed, both of Jews and Greeks, a great throng.

2. But, the unpersuaded Jews, roused up and provoked the souls of them of the nations against the brethren.

3. A good while, therefore, tarried they, using boldness of speech   upon the Lord, who was bearing witness unto his word of favour, granting signs and wonders to be coming to pass through their hands.

4. And the throng of the city was divided; and some indeed were with the Jews, while some were with the apostles.

5. But, when there took place an assault both of them of the nations and of the Jews, with their rulers, to maltreat and to stone them,

6. They became aware of it, and fled unto the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding country;

7. And, there, were they announcing the glad tidings.

8. And, a certain man in Lystra, impotent in his feet, was sitting,lame from his mothers womb, who never had walked.

9. This man, hearkened unto Paul, as he was speaking,who, looking steadfastly at him, and seeing he had faith to be made well,

10. Said, with a loud voiceStand up on thy feet, erect! And he sprang up, and began to walk about.

11. And, the multitudes, seeing what Paul had done, lifted up their voice, in the speech of LycaoniaThe gods, made like unto men, have come down unto us!

12. And they went on to call Barnabas, Jupiter, and Paul, Mercury, seeing that, he, was the leader of discourse.

13. Also, the priest of the Jupiter that was before the city, bringing bulls and garlands unto the gates, with the multitudes, would have offered sacrifice.

14. But the apostles Barnabas and Paul, hearing of it, rending asunder their own mantles, sprang forward amidst the multitude, crying aloud,

15. and sayingMen! Why, these things, are ye doing? We also, of like nature with you, are men, bringing you the good news, that from these vain things, ye should be turning unto a living God:Who made heaven and the earth and the sea and all things therein;

16. Who in the bygone generations suffered all the nations to be going on in their own ways,

17. Although, not without witness, he left himself, doing good, from heaven, upon you, giving rain and fruitful seasons, filling, with food and gladness, your hearts.

18. Even these things, saying, scarcely restrained they the multitudes from offering sacrifice unto them.

19. But there came thither, from Antioch and Iconium, Jews, and, persuading the multitudes, and stoning Paul, they dragged him outside the city, supposing him to be dead.

20. Howbeit, the disciples surrounding him, he rose up, and entered into the city. And, on the morrow, he went forth, with Barnabas, unto Derbe.

21. Delivering the good news unto that city also, and making a good number of disciples, they returned unto Lystra, and unto Iconium, and unto Antioch,

22. confirming the souls of the disciples, beseeching them to abide in the faith, and   that, through many tribulations, must we enter into the kingdom of God.

23. Moreover, appointing unto them by vote, in each assembly, elders, praying with fastings, they commended them unto the Lord on whom they had believed.

24. And, passing through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia;

25. and, speaking in Perga the word, they came down unto Attalia;

26. and, from thence, they set sail for Antioch, whence they had been given up unto the favour of God for the work which they had fulfilled.

27. And, when they had arrived and gathered together the assembly, they began recounting how many things God had done with them, and that he had opened, unto the nations, a door of faith.

28. And they spent no little time with the disciples.

## Acts 15

1. And, certain persons, coming down from Judea, began to teach the brethrenExcept ye be circumcised according to the custom of Moses, ye cannot be saved.

2. And, when Paul and Barnabas had had no little dissension and discussion with them, it was arranged that Paul and Barnabas and certain others from among them should go up unto the Apostles and Elders in Jerusalem concerning this question,

3. They, therefore, being set forward by the Assembly, began passing through Phoenicia and Samaria, fully relating the conversion of them of the nations, and were causing great joy unto all the brethren.

4. And, having arrived in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the Assembly and the Apostles and the Elders; and they recounted all things God had done with them.

5. But there

6. And the Apostles and Elders were gathered together to see about this matter.

7. And, when much discussion had arisen, Peter standing up, said unto themBrethren! Ye yourselves, well know that, in days long past, amongst you, God chose that, through my mouth, the nations should hear the word of the glad tidings, and believe.

8. And, the heart-observing God, bare witness,unto them, giving the Holy Spirit, just as, even unto us;

9. and made no distinction at all betwixt us and them, by their faith, purifying their hearts.

10. Now, therefore, why are ye proving God, that ye should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which, neither our fathers, nor we, have been able to bear.

11. But, through the favour of the Lord Jesus, we believe we shall be saved, in like manner as, even they.

12. And all the throng held their peace, and began to hearken unto Barnabas and Paul relating how many signs and wonders God had done among the nations, through them.

13. And, after they held their peace, James answered, sayingBrethren! hearken unto me.

14. Symeon, hath fully told how God, first visited, to take out of the nations, a people for his name.

15. And, with this, agree the words of the prophets, according as it is written

16. After these things, will I return, and will rebuild the tent of David that hath fallen, and, the ruins thereof, will I rebuild, and will set it up again:

17. That the residues of men may seek out the Lord, and all the nations upon whom my name hath been called, saith the Lord that doeth these things,

18. Known from age-past times.

19. Wherefore, I, judge, not to be troubling them who, from the nations, are turning unto God;

20. but to write unto them, to abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.

21. For, Moses, out of ancient generation, hath, in every city, them who proclaim him; seeing, that in the synagogues, every sabbath, he is read.

22. Then, seemed it good unto the Apostles and the Elders with the whole Assembly to send chosen men from among them unto Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas,even Judas who is called Barsabbas, and Silas, men taking a lead among the brethren:

23. writing through their handThe Apostles and the Elder Brethren, unto the brethren throughout Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, who are from among the nations, wish joy!

24. Inasmuch as we had heard that, certain from among us, had troubled you with words, dismantling your souls,unto whom we had given no instructions,

25. It seemed good unto us, coming to be of one accord, that we should choose men and send them unto you, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,

26. men who have given up their lives in behalf of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

27. We have sent, therefore, Judas and Silas, who also, themselves, by word of mouth, can tell you the same things.

28. For it hath seemed good unto the Holy Spirit and unto us, no greater burden, to be laying upon you, than these necessary things:

29. To be abstaining from idol sacrifices, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication,From which, if ye keep yourselves, ye shall prosper. Fare ye well.

30. They, therefore, being let go, came down unto Antioch; and, having gathered together the throng, delivered the letter,

31. and, when they read it, they rejoiced for the consolation.

32. And, both Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, with much discourse, consoled and confirmed the brethren.

33. And, when they had spent a time, they were let go, in peace, from the brethren, unto them who had sent them.

35. But, Paul and Barnabas, tarried in Antioch, teaching and telling the joyful tidings,along with many others also,of the word of the Lord.

36. And, after certain days, Paul, said unto BarnabasLet us now return, and visit the brethren in every city in which we have declared the word of the Lord, and see how they are.

37. And, Barnabas, was minded to take with them John also, called Mark;

38. but Paul deemed it right, as to him who had withdrawn from them, back from Pamphylia, and had not gone with them unto the work, not to be taking with them, this, man.

39. And there arose an angry feeling, so that they separated one from the other: and, Barnabas, taking Mark, sailed away unto Cyprus,

40. whereas, Paul, choosing Silas, went forth, committed unto the favour of the Lord by the brethren,

41. and proceeded to pass through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the assemblies.

## Acts 16

1. And he came even unto Derbe, and unto Lystra; and lo! a certain disciple, was there, by name Timothy, son of a believing Jewish woman, but whose father was a Greek,

2. who was well-attested by the brethren in Lystra, and Iconium.

3. The same, would Paul have go forth with him, and took and circumcised him, on account of the Jews who were in those places; for they one and all knew that, his father, was, a Greek.

4. And, as they passed through the cities, they were delivering unto them, for observance, the decrees which had been decided upon by the Apostles and Elders who were in Jerusalem.

5. The assemblies, therefore, were being confirmed in the faith, and increasing in number, every day.

6. And they passed through the Phrygian and Galatian country, being forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia;

7. but, coming along Mysia, they were attempting to journey into Bithynia,and, the Spirit of Jesus, suffered them not;

8. but, passing by Mysia, they came down unto Troas.

9. And, a vision, by night, unto Paul appeared:A man of Macedonia, there was, standing and beseeching him, and sayingCome over into Macedonia, and bring us succour!

10. Now, when, the vision, he had seen, straightway, we sought to go forth unto Macedonia, concluding that God, had summoned us to tell the glad tidings unto them.

11. Setting sail, therefore, from Troas, we ran straight into Samothracia, and, on the morrow, unto New City,

12. and, from thence, unto Philippi,which, indeed, is the first city of the part of Macedoniaa colony. And we were, in this city, spending certain days;

13. and on the day of rest, we went forth outside the gate, beside a river, where we supposed there was a place of prayer,and, sitting down, we went on to speak unto the women who had come together.

14. And, a certain woman, by name Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, devout towards God, was hearkening, whose heart, the Lord, fully opened, to be giving heed unto the things being spoken by Paul.

15. And, when she was immersed, and her house, she besought

16. And it came to pass, as we were on our way unto the place of prayer, a certain damsel, having a spirit of Python, met us,who, indeed, much gain, was presenting unto her masters, by divining.

17. The same, following after Paul and us, kept crying aloud, sayingThese men, are servants of the Most High God,who, indeed, are declaring unto you a way of salvation.

18. And, this, she continued to do for many days. But Paul, worn out, and turning unto the spirit, saidI charge thee, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come out from her. And it came out the same hour.

19. And, her masters, seeing that their hope of gain had gone out, laying hold on Paul and Silas, dragged them into the market-place, unto the rulers;

20. and, leading them forward unto the magistrates, saidThese men, are exceedingly troubling our city, they, being Jews,

21. And are declaring customs, which it is not allowable for us either to accept or to observe, being Romans.

22. And the multitude rose up together against them, and, the magistrates, rending off them their mantles, were giving orders to beat them with rods;

23. and, laying upon them many stripes, they thrust them into prison, charging the prison-keeper, safely, to be keeping them:

24. who, a charge like this receiving, thrust them into the inner prison, and, their feet, made he fast in the stocks.

25. And, at midnight, Paul and Silas, being at prayer, began singing praise unto God; and the prisoners unto them, did hearken.

26. And, suddenly, a great earthquake took place,so that the foundations of the prison were shaken, and all the doors were  instantly  set open, and the bonds of all were unfastened.

27. And, the prison-keeper, being wakened and seeing that the doors of the prison had been opened, drawing his sword, was about to kill himself, supposing the prisoners to have fled.

28. But Paul called out with a loud voice, sayingBy no means, do thyself harm, for we are, one and all, here.

29. And, asking for a light, he sprang in, and becoming, agitated, fell down unto Paul and Silas,

30. and, leading them forth outside, saidSirs! what must I be doing, that I may be saved?

31. And, they, saidBelieve on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou, and thy house.

32. And they spake unto him the word of God, with all who were in his house.

33. And, taking them with him, in that hour of the night, he bathed them from their stripes, and was immersed, he, and his, one and all, on the spot;

34. and, leading them up into his house, he set near a table,and exulted, having, with all his house, believed in God.

35. And. when day came. the magistrates sent off the constables sayingLet those men go!

36. And the prison-keeper reported the words unto PaulThe magistrates have sent, that ye be let go. Now, therefore, going forth, be taking your journey in peace.

37. But, Paul, said unto themBeating us, in public, uncondemned, men that are Romans, they thrust us into prison;and, now, by stealth, are they thrusting us forth? Nay, verily! but let them come, themselves, and lead us out!

38. And the constables reported unto the magistrates these words; and they were struck with fear, when they heard that they were, Romans;

39. and came, and besought them, and, leading them out, went on to request them to depart from the city.

40. And so, coming forth from the prison, they went unto Lydia, and, seeing the brethren, they comforted them, and went forth.

## Acts 17

1. And, travelling through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews;

2. and, according to Pauls custom, he went in unto them, and, for three sabbaths, reasoned with them from the Scriptures,

3. opening up, and setting forth, that it was needful for, the Christ, to suffer, and to arise from among the dead; and   , This, is the Christ,Jesus, whom, I, am declaring unto you.

4. And, some from among them, were persuaded, and cast in their lot with Paul and Silas; also, of the devout Greeks, a great throng, and, of the chief women, not a few.

5. But the Jews, being, jealous, and taking unto themselves certain wicked men, of the rabble, and making a riot, were setting the city in an uproar; and, besieging the house of Jason, were seeking to lead them forth unto the populace,

6. and, not finding them, they began dragging Jason and certain brethren unto the city-rulers, shoutingThey who have thrown the inhabited earth into confusion, the same, hither also, are come,

7. unto whom Jason hath given welcome; and, these all, contrary to the decrees of Caesar, are acting,saying that there is another king, Jesus.

8. And they troubled the multitude and the city-rulers, when they heard these things;

9. and, taking security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.

10. But, the brethren, straightway, during the night, sent away both Paul and Silas unto Beroea, who, indeed, arriving, unto the synagogue of the Jews, went off;

11. and, these, were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they welcomed the word with all readiness of mind, daily, searching the Scriptures,whether these things could be so.

12. Many, therefore, from among them, believed, and, of the Grecian women of the higher class, and of men, not a few.

13. But, when the Jews from Thessalonica came to know that, in Beroea also, had the word of God been declared by Paul, they came thither also, stirring up and troubling the multitudes.

14. Howbeit, then, immediately, the brethren sent away, Paul, to be journeying as far as unto the sea; and both Silas and Timothy stayed behind, there.

15. But, they who were conducting Paul, brought him as far as Athens, and, receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timothy, that with, all possible speed, they would come unto him, they departed.

16. But, while, in Athens, Paul was expecting them, his spirit within him was being urged on, seeing how the city was given to idols.

17. So then, he began reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews, and with them who worshipped; and, in the market-place, every day, with them who happened to be at hand.

18. But, certain both of the Epicurean and of the Stoic philosophers, were encountering him; and some were sayingWhat might this picker-up-of-scraps wish to be saying? And, othersOf foreign demons, he seemeth to be a declarer: because, of Jesus and the Resurrection, he was announcing the joyful tidings.

19. And so, laying hold of him, they brought him up, to the Hill of Mars, sayingCan we get to know what this new teaching is, which, by thee, is being spoken.

20. For, certain foreign things, art thou bringing into our hearing: We are minded to get to know, therefore, what these things please to be!

21. Now, all Athenians and the sojourning foreigners, unto nothing else, were devoting their leisure, than to be telling or hearing, something newer.

22. And Paul taking his stand in the midst of the Hill of Mars, saidYe men of Athens! In every way, how unusually reverent of the demons ye are, I perceive.

23. For, passing through, and carefully observing your objects of devotion, I found an altar also, in which was inscribedUnto an Unknown God. What, therefore, not knowing, ye reverence, the same, do, I, declare unto you.

24. The God that made the world and all things that are therein, the same, being, Lord, of heaven and earth, not in hand-made shrines, doth dwell,

25. nor, by human hands, is waited upon, as though in want of anything, himself, giving unto all life and breath and all things;

26. he made also, of one, every nation of men to dwell upon all the face of the earth,marking out fitting opportunities, and the bounds of their dwelling place,

27. that they might be seeking Godif, after all, indeed, they might feel after him and find him,although, in truth, he is already not far from any one of us.

28. For, in him, we live and move and are: as, even some of your own poets, have saidFor, his offspring also, we are.

29. Being, then, offspring, of God, we ought not to be supposing that, unto gold or silver or stone, graven by art and device of man, the Divine, is like.

30. The times of ignorance, therefore, overlooking, God, as things now are, is charging all men everywhere to repent,

31. inasmuch as he hath appointed a day, in which he is about to be judging the habitable earth in righteousness, by a man whom he hath pointed out,offering faith unto all, by raising him from among the dead?

32. Now, when they heard of raising the dead, some, indeed, began to mock, while, others, saidWe will hear thee, concerning this, even again.

33. Thus, Paul, came forth out of their midst.

34. But, certain persons, joining themselves unto him, believed; among whom were even Dionysius the Mars-hill judge, and a woman by name Damaris, and others with them.

## Acts 18

1. After these things, withdrawing from Athens, he came unto Corinth;

2. and, finding a certain Jew, by name Aquila, of Pontus by birth,lately come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife, because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to be leaving Rome, he came unto them,

3. and, because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought, for they were tent-makers by their trade.

4. And he began reasoning in the synagogue every sabbath, and was persuading both Jews and Greeks.

5. When, however, both Silas and Timothy had come down from Macedonia, Paul began to be urged on in the word, bearing full witness unto the Jews that, Jesus, was, the Christ.

6. But, as they began opposing and defaming, shaking out his garments, he said unto themYour blood, be upon your own head! Pure, am, I: henceforth, unto the nations, will I go.

7. And, removing from thence, he came into the house of a certain man by name Titius Justus, who worshipped God, whose house was adjoining unto the synagogue.

8. But, Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, with all his house. And, many of the Corinthians, hearing, were believing, and being immersed.

9. And the Lord said by night, through means of a vision, unto PaulBe not afraid! but be speaking,and do not hold thy peace;

10. Inasmuch as, I, am with thee, and, no one, shall set upon thee to harm thee; inasmuch as I have much people in this city.

11. And he remained a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God.

12. But, when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews, with one accord, set upon Paul, and led him unto the judgment-seat,

13. sayingContrary to the law, is this one seducing men to be worshipping God.

14. But, as Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the JewsIf, indeed, it had been some wrong or wicked recklessness, O Jews, with reason, in that case, should I have been bearing with you.

15. If, however, they are questions concerning discourse, and names, and law, that which ye have, ye shall see to it, yourselves; A judge of these things, I, am not disposed to be.

16. And he drove them from the judgment-seat.

17. But they all, laying hold of Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue, began to strike him before the judgment-seat; and, for none of these things, did Gallio care.

18. Paul, however, still further abiding a good many days with the brethren, bidding them adieu, set sail for Syria; and, with him, Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchreae, for he had a vow.

19. And they came down to Ephesus; and, as for them, he left them there,but, himself entering into the synagogue, he reasoned with the Jews.

20. And, when they requested him for a longer time to abide, he consented not;

21. but, bidding them adieu, and sayingAgain, will I return unto you, God willing, he sailed away from Ephesus;

22. and, putting in at Caesarea, going up and saluting the assembly, went down unto Antioch;

23. and, spending some time, he went forth, passing through, in order, the country of Galatia and Phrygia, confirming all the disciples.

24. But, a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by birth, a learned man, came down to Ephesus, being, mighty, in the Scriptures.

25. The same, had been orally taught the way of the Lord, and, being fervent in his spirit, began speaking and teaching accurately, the things concerning Jesus,properly knowing, only the immersion of John.

26. The same, also began speaking boldly in the synagogue; and Priscilla and Aquila, hearing him, took him unto them, and, more accurately, expounded unto him the way of God.

27. And, he being minded to pass through into Achaia, the brethren urgently wrote unto the disciples to welcome him,who, arriving, was very useful unto them who had believed, with his gift;

28. for, with great force, began he confuting the Jews, publicly, shewing by the Scriptures that Jesus was, the Christ.

## Acts 19

1. And it came to pass, while Apollos was in Corinth, Paul, passing through the upper parts, came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples;

2. and he said unto themHoly Spirit, received ye, when ye believed? And they said unto himNay! not even whether there is Holy Spirit, did we hear.

3. And he saidInto what, then, were ye immersed? And, they, saidUnto Johns immersion.

4. Then said PaulJohn, immersed with an immersion of repentance, unto the people, saying, that, on him who was coming after him, they should believe,that is, on Jesus.

5. And, when they heard   , they were immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus;

6. and, Paul laying hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they began speaking with tongues and prophesying.

7. And all the men were about twelve.

8. And, entering into the synagogue, he was speaking boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading concerning the kingdom of God.

9. But, when some were hardening themselves, and refusing to be persuaded, speaking evil of the Way before the throng, withdrawing from them, he separated the disciples; day by day, reasoning in the school of Tyrannus.

10. And, this, took place for two years, so that, all who dwelt in Asia, heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.

11. Mighty works, also, not the ordinary, God was working through the hands of Paul;

12. so that, even unto the sick, were being carried from his body, handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases were departing from them, and, the wicked spirits, were going out.

13. But certain also of the wandering Jews, exorcists, took in hand to be naming, over them that had the wicked spirits, the name of the Lord Jesus, sayingI adjure you, by Jesus whom Paul proclaimeth!

14. And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, a High-priest, who, this thing, were doing.

15. But the wicked spirit. Answering, said unto themJesus,  indeed , I am getting to know, and, Paul, I well-know,but who are, ye?

16. And the man in whom was the wicked spirit, springing upon them, mastering them both, prevailed against them, so that, naked and wounded, fled they out of that house.

17. And, this, became known to allboth Jews and Greekswho were dwelling in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified.

18. Many also of them who had believed, were coming, making open confession, and renouncing their practices.

19. And, a good many of them who had practised the curious arts, bringing together the books, were burning them before all; and they reckoned up the prices of them, and found them fifty thousand pieces of silver.

20. Thus, with might, the Lords word, was growing and prevailing.

21. Now, when these things were fulfilled, Paul purposed in his spirit, going through Macedonia and Achaia, to be journeying unto Jerusalem, sayingAfter I have been there, Rome also, must I see!

22. And, sending off into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself, held on awhile in Asia.

23. And there arose during that season no small disturbance concerning the Way.

24. For, one Demetrius by name, a silversmith, making  silver  shrines, of Diana, used to bring unto the craftsmen no little business;

25. gathering whom together, and them who in such things wrought, he saidMen! ye well know that, by this business, we have our prosperity;

26. and ye perceive and hear that, not only in Ephesus, but well-nigh in all Asia, this Paul, hath persuaded and turned away a considerable multitude, saying that they are, no gods, which, with hands, are made.

27. And, not only is there danger that this our heritage into ill-repute may come, but even that the temple, of the great Goddess Diana, for nothing, may be counted; also that, even on the point of being pulled down, may be Her Majesty, whom, all Asia and the habitable world, do worship.

28. Now, hearing this, and becoming full of wrath, they began crying aloud, sayingGreat, is Diana of the Ephesians!

29. And the city was filled with the confusion; they rushed also with one accord into the theatre, carrying off with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, fellow-travellers of Paul.

30. But, Paul, being minded to enter in among the populace, the disciples would not suffer him.

31. Moreover, certain of the Asiarchs also, being his friends, sending unto him, were beseeching him not to adventure himself into the theatre.

32. Others, indeed, were crying out something else; for the assembly had become confused, and, the greater part, knew not for what cause they had come together.

33. Howbeit, out of the multitude, they bare aloft one Alexander, the Jews thrusting him forward; Alexander, however, waving his hand, was wishing to make his defense unto the populace.

34. But, recognizing that he was a Jew, one voice arose from all for about two hours, as they cried aloudGreat, is Diana of the Ephesians!

35. Howbeit the town-clerk, having calmed the multitude, saithEphesians! why, who is there of mankind that doth not acknowledge the city of Ephesians to be temple-keeper of the Great Diana, and of the  image  that fell from Jupiter?

36. As these things, then, cannot be denied, it is needful that ye be calmed at once, and, nothing rash, be doing.

37. For ye have brought these men, neither as temple-robbers, nor as defaming our goddess.

38. If then, Demetrius, and the craftsmen with him, have against anyone an accusation, courts, are being held, and there are, proconsuls: let them accuse one another!

39. But, if after, something further, ye are seeking, in the regular assembly shall it be settled.

40. For we are, even in danger of being accused of riot, concerning this day, no cause at all, existing, by reference to which we shall be able to give a reason for this concourse.

41. And, these things, having said, he dismissed the assembly.

## Acts 20

1. But, after the tumult had ceased, Paul, sending for the disciples and exhorting them, took leave, and went forth to be journeying unto Macedonia.

2. Passing through those parts, however, and exhorting them with much discourse, he came into Greece;

3. and, spending three months, when a plot was laid against him by the Jews, as he was about to sail to Syria, he determined to turn back through Macedonia.

4. Now there were accompanying him, Sopater, son of Pyrrhus a Beroean; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy; and, of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.

5. And, these, came and were waiting for us at Troas.

6. And, we, sailed forth, after the days of unleavened bread, from Philippi, and came unto them in Troas in five days, where we tarried seven days.

7. And, on the first of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul went on to discourse with them, being about to depart on the morrow; and he prolonged his discourse until midnight.

8. Now there were a good many torches in the upper room, where we were gathered together.

9. And there sat, a certain young man by name Eutychus, in the window, who was getting overpowered by a deep sleep; and, while Paul was discoursing yet further, being overpowered by his sleep, he fell, from the third story, down, and was taken up dead.

10. Going down, however, Paul fell upon him, and, embracing him, saidBe not making confusion; for, his soul, is, in him.

11. And, going up, and breaking the loaf, and tasting,for a good while also conversing, until dawn, thus, he departed.

12. And they brought the boy alive, and were comforted beyond measure.

13. And, we, going forward unto the ship, set sail for Assos, from thence being about to take up Paul; for, so, had he arranged, being about, himself, to go on foot.

14. And, when he fell in with us in Assos, we took him on board, and came into Mitylene;

15. and, from thence sailing away on the morrow, we came over against Chios, and, on the next day, we thrust aside into Samos, and, on the succeeding day, we came into Miletus.

16. For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, lest he should happen to lose time in Asia; for he hastened, if it were possible for him, against the day of Pentecost, to arrive, in Jerusalem.

17. But, from Miletus, he sent unto Ephesus, and called for the elders of the assembly.

18. And, when they were come to him, he said unto themYe yourselves, well know, from the first day when I set foot in Asia, in what manner came to be with you all the time,

19. doing service unto the Lord, with all humility and tears, and temptations which befell me through the plots of the Jews:

20. in what manner I in nowise shrank from announcing unto you anything that was profitable and teaching you publicly and in your homes;

21. bearing full witness, both to Jews and to Greeks, as to the repentance due unto God, and as to belief on our Lord Jesus.

22. And, now, lo! I, bound in my spirit, am journeying unto Jerusalem; the things which therein shall befall me, not knowing,

23. save that, the Holy Spirit, from city to city, doth bear me full witness, saying that, bonds and tribulations, await me.

24. But, for no cause whatever, am I making my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my course and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus, to bear full witness as to the good news of the favour of God.

25. And, now, lo! I, know that, no more, shall ye see my face,ye all, among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom.

26. Wherefore I take you to witness, on this very day, that, pure am I from the blood of all;

27. for I have not shrunk from announcing all the counsel of God unto you.

28. Be taking heed unto yourselves, and unto all the little flock in which the Holy Spirit hath set, you, as overseers,to be shepherding the assembly of God which he hath acquired through means of the blood of his own.

29. I, know, that there will enter, after my departure, grievous wolves into your midst, not sparing the little flock;

30. and, from among your own selves, will arise men speaking distorted things, to draw away the disciples after themselves.

31. Wherefore, be on the watch, remembering that, for three years, night and day, I gave myself no rest, with tears, admonishing each one.

32. Now, therefore, I commend you unto the Lord, and unto his word of favour,which is able to build up and give the inheritance among all the hallowed ones.

33. The silver or gold or apparel of no one, did I covet:

34. yourselves, acknowledge that, for my necessities and for those who were with me, hard wrought these hands!

35. In all things, I gave you to understand, that, thus toiling, it behoves to be helping the weak, also to be keeping in mind the words of the Lord Jesus, that, he himself, saidHappy is it, rather to give than to receive!

36. And, these things saying, kneeling down with them all, he prayed.

37. And they all wept much, and, falling upon Pauls neck, they were tenderly kissing him;

38. being most distressed for the word which he had said,That, no more, should they, his face, behold. And they accompanied him unto the ship.

## Acts 21

1. And it came to pass, when we set sail, having torn ourselves from them, running a straight course, we came unto Cos, and, on the next day, unto Rhodes,and from thence unto Patara;

2. and, finding a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, going on board, we set sail.

3. And, sighting Cyprus, and leaving it behind to the left, we held on our voyage to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for, there, the ship was to discharge her cargo.

4. And, finding up the disciples, we remained there seven days, and they, unto Paul, began to say, through the Spirit, that he would gain no footing in Jerusalem.

5. And, when it came to pass that we had completed the days, we went forth, and continued our journey, all of them accompanying us, with wives and children, as far as outside the city; and, kneeling down on the beach in prayer,

6. we tare ourselves from each other, and we went on board the ship, while, they, returned unto their homes.

7. And, we, finishing the voyage from Tyre, reached Ptolemais, and, saluting the brethren, abode one day with them;

8. and, on the morrow departing, we came to Caesarea, and, entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was of the seven, we abode with him.

9. Nowthis man, had four virgin daughters, who used to prophesy.

10. And, as we stayed on many days, there came down a certain man from Judaea, a prophet, by name Agabus;

11. and, coming unto us, and taking Pauls girdle, he bound his own feet and hands, and saidThus, saith the Holy Spirit, the man whose this girdle is, shall the Jews thus bind in Jerusalem, and deliver up into the hands of Gentiles.

12. And, when we heard these things, both, we, and they of the place began beseeching him, not to go up unto Jerusalem.

13. Then, answered PaulWhat are ye doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For, I, not only to be bound, but to die in Jerusalem, am ready, in behalf of the name of the Lord Jesus.

14. And, as he was not to be persuaded, we ceased, sayingthe Lords, will be done!

15. And, after these days, making ready what we had, we started to go up unto Jerusalem;

16. and there went certain also of the disciples from Caesarea, along with us, who were to introduce us unto one with whom we might be entertained, one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple.

17. Now, when we came to Jerusalem, the brethren, gladly welcomed us.

18. And, on the next day, Paul went in with us unto James, and, all the elders, were present.

19. And, saluting them, he went on to narrate, one by one, each of the things which God had wrought among the nations through his ministry.

20. And, they, having heard, began glorifying God; and they said to himThou observest, brother, how many myriads there are among the Jews who have believed, and, all, are zealous for the law.

21. Now they have heard it rumoured concerning thee, that, an apostacy, art thou teaching, from Moses, unto all the Jews, who are among the nations, telling them not to be circumcising their children, nor, by the customs, to be walking.

22. What, then, is it? at all events, they will hear that thou hast come.

23. This, then, do, which unto thee, we say:We have four men who have a vow upon themselves.

24. Taking these unto thee, be purified with them, and spend something upon them, that they may shave their head; and all will get to know, that the things which they have heard rumoured concerning thee, are, nothing,on the contrary, thou thyself, dost keep the ranks, guarding the law.

25. But, concerning them of the nations who have believed, we ourselves, sent, deciding that they should be guarding themselves, both as to idol sacrifice, and blood, and what is strangled, and fornication.

26. Then Paul, taking unto him the men, on the next day, with them, being purified, began entering into the temple to declare the filling up of the days of the purificationuntil, the offering, had been presented for each one of them.

27. When, however, the seven days were on the point of being concluded, the Jews from Asia, observing him in the temple, began to urge-on all the multitude, and thrust upon them their hands,

28. crying outIsraelites! be giving help! This, is the man who, against the people, and the law, and this place, is teaching, all men everywhere; furthermore, even Greeks, hath he brought into the temple, and hath profaned this holy place.

29. For they had before seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, in the city along with him, whom they were supposing, Paul, had brought, into the temple.

30. And the whole city was set in motion, and there took place a running together of the people, and, laying hold of Paul, they proceeded to drag him outside the temple, and, straightway, the doors were made fast.

31. When, also, they were seeking to slay him, there was carried up information, unto the captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in confusion:

32. who, instantly taking unto him soldiers and centurions, ran down upon them; and, they, seeing the captain and the soldiers, left off striking Paul.

33. Then, the captain, drawing near, laid hold of him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains,and began to enquire, who he might be, and what he had done;

34. but, others, were calling out, something else, in the multitude; and so, as he could not get to know the certainty, because of the tumult, he ordered him to be brought into the castle.

35. And, when he came unto the stairs, so it was that he was borne along by the soldiers, because of the force of the multitude;

36. for the throng of the people was following, crying outAway with him!

37. But, when he was on the point of being taken into the castle, Paul saith unto the captainIs it allowed me, to say somewhat unto thee? And he saidWith Greek, art thou acquainted?

38. Not, then, art, thou, the Egyptian, who, before these days, stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four-thousand men of the Assassins?

39. And Paul saidI, indeed, am a Jew, of Tarsus in Cilicia,a citizen, of no obscure city; but I beseech thee, give me leave to speak unto the people!

40. And, when he had given leave, Paul, standing upon the stairs, waved with his hand unto the people; and, when great silence was secured, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying

## Acts 22

1. Brethren and fathers! Hear ye, the defence, which I now make unto you:

2. And, when they heard that, in the Hebrew language, he had begun to address them, they kept the more quiet. And he saith

3. I, am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but nurtured in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel,trained after the strictness of our ancestral law; being jealous for God just as, all ye, are this day;

4. and, this way, I persecuted unto the death, binding and delivering up into prisons both men and women:

5. as, even the High-priest, beareth me witness, and all the Eldership,from whom, letters also, accepting to the brethren, unto Damascus, was I journeying, to bring them who were there bound unto Jerusalem, that they might be punished.

6. But it befell me, as I was journeying and drawing nigh unto Damascus, that, about mid-daysuddenlyout of heaven, there flashed a great light all around me;

7. I fell also to the ground, and heard a voice saying unto meSaul! Saul! Why, me, art thou persecuting?

8. And, I, answeredWho art thou, Lord? And he said unto meI, am Jesus the Nazarene, whom, thou, art persecuting!

9. Now, they who were with me, beheld, indeed, the light, but heard not, the voice, of him that was speaking with me

10. And saidWhat shall I do, Lord? And, the Lord, said unto meArise, and be going thy way into Damascus, and, there, shall it be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.

11. But, as I could not see clearly owing to the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them who were with me, I came into Damascus.

12. And, one Ananias, a man devout according to the law, well-attested by all the Jews that dwelt there,

13. coming unto me, and standing over me, saidSaul, brother! look up. And, I, in that very hour, looked up on him.

14. And he saidThe God of our fathers, hath chosen thee to get to know his will, and to see the Righteous One,and to hear a voice out of his mouth.

15. Because thou shalt be a witness to him unto all men, of the things which thou hast seen and heard.

16. And, now, what art thou going to do? Arise, and get thyself immersed, and have thy sins bathed away, calling upon his name.

17. And it came to pass, when had returned unto Jerusalem, and was praying in the temple, that I came to be in a trance,

18. and saw him, saying unto meHaste thee, and go forth speedily out of Jerusalem, inasmuch as they will not accept thy witness concerning me.

19. And, I, saidLord! they themselves, well know that I was imprisoning and beating in every synagogue them who were believing on thee.

20. And, when the blood of Stephen thy witness was being shed, even I myself, was standing by, and approving, and guarding the mantles of them who were slaying him.

21. And he said unto me-Be taking thy journey; because, I, unto nations afar off, will send thee.

22. And they hearkened unto him as far as this word, and lifted up their voice, sayingAway from the earth, with such a man as this, for it is not fit that he should live.

23. Now, as they were both making an outcry and tearing their mantles,dust, also were throwing into the air,

24. the captain ordered him to be brought into the castle, saying, that, with scourging, he should be put to the test,that he might find out, for what cause they were, thus, clamouring against him.

25. But, when they had stretched him out with straps, Paul said unto the by-standing centurionA Roman, and uncondemned, is it allowed you to be scourging?

26. And, when the centurion heard   , he went unto the captain, and reported, sayingWhat art thou going to do? For, this man, is, a Roman?

27. And the captain, coming up, said to himTell me! Art, thou, a, Roman? And, he, saidYea!

28. And the captain answeredI, for a large sum, this citizenship acquired! And, Paul, saidBut, I, am even,   born!

29. Straightway, therefore, they who were about to put him to the test, withdrew from him; and, even the captain, was struck with fear, when he found out he was, a Roman, and because, him, he had bound.

30. But, on the morrow, being minded to get to know the certainty as to why he was being accused by the Jews, he released him, and ordered the High-priests and all the High-council to come together; and, bringing down Paul, set him before them.

## Acts 23

1. And Paul, looking steadfastly, at the High-council, saidBrethren! I, in all good conscience have used my citizenship for God until this day.

2. And, the High-priest, Ananias, ordered them that stood by him, to be smiting him on the mouth.

3. Then, Paul, unto him, saidGod is about to be smiting thee, thou whited wall! Dost, thou, then sit to judge me according to the law, and, unlawfully, orderest me to be smitten?

4. And, they who stood by, saidThe High-priest of God, dost thou revile?

5. And Paul saidI was not aware, brethren, that he was high-priest; because it is writtenOf a ruler of thy people, shalt thou not speak injuriously.

6. But Paul, getting to know that, the one part, were Sadducees and, the other, Pharisees, began to cry aloud in the councilBrethren! I, am, a Pharisee, son of Pharisees:Concerning a hope, even of a rising again of the dead, am I to be judged.

7. And, as this he was saying, there arose a dissension of the Pharisees and Sadducees; and rent asunder was the throng.

8. For, Sadducees, say, there is no rising again, nor messenger, nor spirit, whereas, Pharisees, confess them both.

9. And there arose a great outcry, and certain of the Scribes of the party of the Pharisees, standing up, began to strive, sayingNothing bad, find we in this man;but, if a spirit hath spoken unto him, or a messenger

10. And, great dissension arising, the captain, fearing lest Paul would be torn in pieces by them, ordered the troop to go down, and take him by force out of their midst, to bring him into the castle.

11. But, on the following night, the Lord, standing over him, saidBe of good courage! for, as thou hast fully borne witness of the things concerning me in Jerusalem, so must thou, in Rome also, bear witness.

12. And, when it became day, the Jews, forming a conspiracy, bound themselves under a curse, saying, that they would neither eat nor drink till they had slain Paul.

13. And they were, more than forty, who, this sworn-confederacy, had formed.

14. And they went unto the High-priests and Elders, and saidWith a curse have we bound ourselves, to taste, nothing, until we have slain Paul.

15. Now, therefore, do, ye, with the High-council, make it appear unto the captain, that he should bring him down unto you, as though about to ascertain more exactly the things that concern him; and, we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.

16. But Pauls sisters son hearing of the lying-in-wait, happening to be near, and coming into the castle,reported it unto Paul.

17. And Paul, calling unto him one of the centurions, saidThis young man, lead thou away unto the captain, for he hath somewhat to report unto him.

18. He, therefore, taking him with him, brought him unto the captain, and saithThe prisoner Paul, calling me unto him, requested me to bring this young man unto thee, as having somewhat to tell thee.

19. And the captain, taking him by the hand, and going aside, began, privately, to askWhat is it which thou hast to report unto me?

20. And he saidThe Jews, have agreed to request thee, that, to-morrow, thou wouldst bring, Paul, down into the High-council, as though about to ascertain something, more exact, concerning him.

21. Thou, therefore, do not be persuaded by them, for there are lying in wait for him, from among them, more than forty men,who, indeed, have bound themselves under a curse, neither to eat nor drink, till they have killed him; and, now, are they ready, awaiting the promise, from thee.

22. the captain, therefore, dismissed the young man, charging himUnto no one, divulge thou, that, these things, thou hast shewed unto me.

23. And calling certain two of the centurions he saidMake ye ready two hundred soldiers, that they may journey as far as Caesarea,and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, by the third hour of the night;

24. beasts also provide, in order that, seating Paul thereon, they may bring him safely through unto Felix the governor.

25. And he wrote a letter, after this form:

26. Claudius Lysias, unto the most excellent governor Felix, Joy!

27. This man, having been apprehended by the Jews, and being about to be killed by them, I went down with the troop, and rescued; having learned that he was, a Roman.

28. And, being minded to find out the cause for which they were accusing him,  I took him down into their High-council ,

29. whom I found to be accused concerning questions of their law, but, of nothing worthy of death or bonds, to be charged.

30. But, when I was informed there would be a plot against the man, forthwith, I sent him unto thee, charging, his accusers also, to be speaking against him before thee.

31. So the soldiers, according to their orders, taking up Paul, brought him by night unto Antipatris;

32. and, on the morrow, leaving the horsemen to go on with him, returned to the castle,

33. and the others, entering into Caesarea, and delivering the letter unto the governor, set, Paul also, before him.

34. And, when he had read it, and asked out of what province he was, and learned that he was from Cilicia,

35. I myself will hear thee in full, said he, whensoever, thine accusers also, are come; and gave orders that, in the palace of Herod, he should be kept under guard.

## Acts 24

1. And, after five days, came down the High-priest Ananias, with certain Elders and a certain orator Tertullus, and they informed the governor against Paul.

2. And, when he was called, Tertullus began to make accusation, sayingSeeing that, great peace, we are obtaining through thee, and that, reforms, are being brought about for this nation through thy forethought,

3. both in all ways and in all places, are we accepting it, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.

4. But, lest I too long detain thee, I beseech thee to hear us concisely in thy considerateness.

5. For, finding this man a pest, and moving sedition with all the Jews that are throughout the inhabited earth, a leader also of the sect of the Nazarenes,

6. who also attempted to desecrate even, the temple, whom we also seized,

8. from whom thou shall be able, thyself, by making examination concerning all these things, to ascertain the things of which, we, are accusing him.

9. Moreover, the Jews also were joining in the attack, saying that, these things, were, so.

10. And Paul answered, when the governor had motioned him to be speaking,Well knowing thee to have been, for many years, judge unto his nation, cheerfully, as to the things concerning myself, do I make defence;

11. seeing thou art able to ascertain, that there are, not more, than twelve days, since I went up to worship in Jerusalem,

12. and neither, in the temple, found they me, with any one, disputing, or causing, a halt, of the multitude, either in the synagogues or throughout the city,

13. neither can they make good the things concerning which they are, now, accusing me.

14. But I confess, this, unto thee,That, according to the Way which they call a Sect, so, I am rendering divine service unto my fathers God, believing in all the things which, throughout the law, and those which, in the prophets, are written:

15. Having, hope, towards God, which, even these themselves, do entertainthat, a resurrection, there shall certainly be, both of righteous and of unrighteous:

16. herein, even I, myself, am studying to have, an unoffending conscience, towards God and men, continually.

17. Now, after many years, intending to do, alms, unto my nation, I arrived,also   offerings; among which they found me, purified in the temple, not with a multitude, nor with tumult;

18. but certain Jews from Asia   ,

19. who ought, before thee, to have presented themselves, and to have been laying accusation, if, anything, they might have had against me:

20. Or, let, these themselves, say what wrong they found, when I stood before the High-council,

21. unless concerning this one voice, wherewith I cried aloud among them, as I stoodConcerning the raising of the dead, am, I, to be judged, this day, by you.

22. And Felix deferred them, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way,sayingAs soon as, Lysias the captain, hath come down, I will give judgment as to your affairs,

23. giving orders unto the centurion, that he should be kept, and have a measure of liberty, and to be hindering, none, of his own from waiting upon him.

24. And, after certain days, Felix having arrived, with Drusilla his own wife, who was, a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith, respecting Christ Jesus.

25. And, as he was reasoning of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix, becoming greatly afraid, answeredFor the present, be going thy way, and, when I find an opportunity, I will send for thee,

26. at the same time, also hoping that, money, would be given him by Paul; wherefore also, the more frequently sending for him, he used to converse with him.

27. When, however, two years, were completed, Felix, was succeeded, by Porcius Festus, and Felix, wishing to gain favour with the Jews, left Paul bound.

## Acts 25

1. Festus, therefore, having come upon the province, after three days, went up unto Jerusalem from Caesarea;

2. and the High-priest and chiefs of the Jews laid information before him against Paul, and began to beseech him

3. asking for themselves as a favour against him, that he would send for him unto Jerusalem,making, an ambush, to kill him on the way.

4. Festus, therefore, answered, that Paul should be kept in Caesarea, and that, he himself, was about, shortly, to be going out   .

5. They, therefore, among you (saith he) who are in power, let them go down with me; and, if there is in the man, anything amiss, let them accuse him.

6. And, spending among them, not more than eight or ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and, on the morrow, taking his place upon the judgment-seat, ordered Paul to be brought.

7. And, when he presented himself, the Jews who, from Jerusalem, had come down, stood round about him, many and grievous charges, bringing against   , which they were not able to prove,

8. Paul saying in defenceNeither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I in anything sinned.

9. But, Festus, wishing, with the Jews, to gain, favour, answered Paul, and saidArt thou willing, unto Jerusalem, to go up, and, there, concerning these things, be judged before me?

10. But Paul saidStanding before the judgment-seat of Caesar, am I, where, I, ought to be judged. Unto the Jews, have I done no wrong, as, even thou, right well, art discovering.

11. If then, on the one hand, I am doing wrong, and, anything worthy of death, have committed, I excuse not myself from dying; but, on the other hand, if there is, nothing, in the things whereof these are accusing me, no man, hath power to give, me, unto them as a favour:Unto Caesar, I appeal!

12. Then Festus, having conversed with the council, answeredUnto Caesar, hast thou appealed? Unto Caesar, shalt thou go.

13. And, some days having gone by, Agrippa the king and Bernice came down to Caesarea, to salute Festus.

14. And, as they were spending more days there, Festus, repeated, unto the king, the things relating to Paul, sayingA certain man, hath been left behind by Felix, as a prisoner;

15. concerning whom, when I happened to be in Jerusalem, the High-priests and the Elders of the Jews laid information, claiming against him a condemnation:

16. unto whom made answerThat it is not a custom with Romans, to grant as a favour any man, before the accused, face to face, should have his accusers, and, opportunity of defence, should receive, concerning the charge.

17. When, therefore, they had come together here, no delay whatever, making, on the next day, taking my place upon the judgment-seat, I ordered the man to be brought:

18. Concerning whom, taking their stand, his accusers, no accusation at all, were bringing, of the evil things which, I, had been suspecting;

19. but, certain questions concerning their own demon-worship, had they against him, and concerning one Jesus, who had died, whom Paul was affirming to be alive.

20. And, I, being at a loss as to the inquiry into these things, was askingwhether he might be minded to go unto Jerusalem, and, there, be judged concerning these things.

21. But, Paul, having appealed to be kept for the decision of the Emperor, I ordered him to be kept, until I could send him up unto Caesar.

22. And, Agrippa,   unto FestusI could wish, myself also, to hear, the man. To-morrow, (saith he) thou shalt hear him.

23. On the morrow, therefore, when Agrippa had come, and Bernice, with great display, and they had entered into the audience-chamber, with the captains of thousands and men of distinction of the city,and Festus had given orders, Paul was brought.

24. And Festus saithKing Agrippa! and all ye men, here present with us: Ye observe this person, concerning whom, one and all the throng of the Jews, have interceded with me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying aloud that he ought not to be living any longer.

25. But, I, gathered, that, nothing worthy of death, had he committed; and, this man himself, having appealed unto the Emperor, I decided to send him:

26. Concerning whom, anything certain to write unto my lord, I have not; wherefore, I have brought him forth before you,and especially before thee, King Agrippa! in order that, after examination had, I might have something I could write;

27. For, unreasonable, unto me, it seemeth, when sending a prisoner, not also, the accusations against him, to signify.

## Acts 26

1. And, Agrippa, to Paul, saidIt is permitted thee, on thine own behalf, to be speaking. Then Paul, stretching forth his hand, went on to make his defence.

2. Concerning all things of which I am accused by Jews, King Agrippa, I have been counting myself happy, that, before thee, am I about, this day, to be making my defence;

3. especially, as thou art, well-versed, in all the Jewish customs and questions. Wherefore, I beseech thee, patiently, to hear me.

4. My manner of life, then, from my youth, which, from its commencement, was formed among my nation, even in Jerusalem, know all Jews,

5. inasmuch as they were aforetime observing me, from the outset,if they please to bear witness,that, according to the strictest sect of our own religion, I lived, a Pharisee.

6. And, now, for the hope of the promise, unto our fathers, being brought to pass by God, am I standing to be judged,

7. unto which   , our twelve-tribed nation, with intensity, night and day, rendering divine service, is hoping to attainconcerning which hope, I am being accused by Jews, O King!

8. What! incredible, is it judged with you, that, God the dead doth raise?

9. I, therefore, imagined to myself, that, against the name of Jesus the Nazarene, it was needful, many hostile things, to bring about,

10. which also I did in Jerusalem, yea and, many of the saints, I myself, in prisons, shut up,the authority, from the High-priests, having received: and, when they were to be put to death, I brought against them my vote;

11. and, throughout all the synagogues, ofttimes punishing them, I would fain have compelled them to defame; and, being excessively maddened against them, I went on to pursue them as far as even the outlying cities.

12. Among which things, being on a journey unto Damascus, with the authority and commission of the High-priests,

13. at midday, on the road, I saw, O King, from heaven, above the splendour of the sun, shining around me, a light, and   them who, with me, were journeying;

14. and, when we were all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice, saying unto me, in the Hebrew languageSaul! Saul! why, me, art thou persecuting? It is hard for thee, against goads, to be kicking!

15. And, I, saidWho art thou, Lord? And the Lord saidI, am Jesus, whom, thou, art persecuting!

16. But rise and stand upon thy feet; for, to this end, have I appeared unto thee,To appoint thee an attendant and a witness, both of the things as to which thou hast seen me, and of those as to which I will appear unto thee:

17. Rescuing thee from among the people, and from among the nations, unto whom, I, am sending thee

18. To open their eyes; that they turn from darkness unto light, and the authority of Satan unto God, that they may receive remission of sins, and an inheritance among them who have been made holy by the faith respecting me.

19. Wherefore, O King Agrippa,I became not disobedient unto the heavenly vision;

20. Butboth to them in Damascus, first, and in Jerusalem, unto all the country of Judaea also, and unto the nations, I carried tidingsthat they should repent, and turn unto God, and, works worthy of their repentance, should practise.

21. Because of these things, Jews seized me in the temple, and were attempting to slay me with their own hands.

22. So then, having met with, the help that is from God, until this day, do I stand, witnessing to both small and great, nothing else saying, than those things which both the prophets, and Moses, did say should certainly come to pass:

23. If, to suffer, the Christ was destined, if, the first of a resurrection of the dead, he is about to carry tidings, of light, both unto the people, and unto the nations.

24. Now, as he was saying these things in his defence, Festus, with a loud voice, saithThou art raving, Paul! Thy great learning, is turning thee round unto, raving madness.

25. But PaulI am not raving (saith he), most noble Festus,but, the declarations of truth and soberness, am I sounding forth:

26. For well-knoweth, the king, concerning these things, unto whom, with boldness of utterance, am I speaking; for, that these things are not hidden from him, I am well persuaded,for, not in a corner, hath this thing been done.

27. Believest thou, King Agrippa, in the prophets? I know that thou believest!

28. And, Agrippa,   unto PaulAlmost, art thou persuading, me, to become a, Christian!

29. And, Paul,   I could pray unto God that, both almost and altogether, not only thou but all they who are hearing me this day, might become such,as even, I, am, excepting these bonds.

30. And the king rose up, and the governor, Bernice also, and they who had been sitting with them;

31. And, retiring, they began conversing one with another, saying, Nothing worthy of death or of bonds, doth this man practise.

32. And, Agrippa, unto Festus, saidThis man might have been released, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.

## Acts 27

1. Now, when it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they proceeded to deliver Paul, and certain other prisoners, unto a centurion by name Julius, of an Augustan band.

2. And, going on board a ship of Adramittium, about to sail unto the places along the coast of Asia, we put to sea, there being with us, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica;

3. and, on the next day, we put into Zidon,and Julius, treating Paul, kindly, gave him leave to go unto his friends and refresh himself;

4. and, from thence putting out to sea, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary;

5. and, sailing across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came down to Myra, a city of Lycia.

6. And the centurion, there, finding a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy, put us therein.

7. And, for a good many days sailing slowly, and getting with difficulty over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us to get on, we sailed under the lee of Crete, over against Salmone;

8. and, with difficulty coasting it, we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near to which was the city of Lasea.

9. And, when a considerable time had passed, and sailing was already dangerous, because, even the Fast, had already gone by, Paul began to advise,

10. saying to themSirs! I perceive that, with damage and great loss, not only of the cargo and of the ship, but even of our persons, shall the voyage certainly be attended.

11. But, the centurion, by the master, and by the shipowner, was more persuaded than by the things which, by Paul, were spoken.

12. And, the harbour being, incommodious, to winter in, the more part, advised to put to sea from thence, if by any means they might be able to reach Phoenix, to winter,   a harbour of Crete, looking north-east and south-east.

13. And, a south wind blowing softly, supposing they had secured their purpose, weighing anchor, they began to sail close in shore along Crete.

14. But, after no long time, there beat down from it a tempestuous wind, called Euraquilo,

15. and, the ship being caught and we not being able to bring her head to the wind, we let her go, and were borne along.

16. And, running under the lee, of some small island, called Cauda, we were able, with difficulty, to make ourselves masters of the boat,

17. which, hoisting up, they began to use, helps, under-girding the ship; and, fearing lest, on the sand-bank of Africa, they should run aground, lowering the gear, so, were they borne along.

18. But, we being exceedingly tempest-tossed, on the next day, they began to throw   overboard;

19. and, on the third day, with their own hands, the tackling of the ship, they cast away.

20. And, neither, sun nor stars, appearing for many days, and, no small tempest, lying upon us, in the end, all hope that we should be saved, began to be taken from us.

21. But, when they had been, long without food, then, Paul, standing in the midst of them, saidYe ought, indeed, Sir! yielding to me, not to have sailed away from Crete, to get this damage and loss.

22. And, now, I recommend you to be of good courage; for, loss of life, shall there be, none at all, from among you,only the ship.

23. For there stood by me this night, belonging unto the God whose I am, unto whom also I am doing divine service, a messenger,

24. sayingBe not afraid, Paul! for, before Caesar, must thou needs stand. And lo! God hath granted to thee as a favour, all them who are sailing with thee.

25. Wherefore, be of good courage, Sirs; for I believe in Godthat, so, it shall be, according as it hath been told me.

26. Upon a certain island, however, must we needs be wrecked.

27. And, when, the fourteenth night, had come, and we were being driven to and fro in the Adriatic, about midnight, the sailors suspected that some country was, nearing, them;

28. and, sounding, they found twenty fathoms,and, going a little further, and again sounding, they found fifteen fathoms.

29. And, fearing lest haply, on rocky places, we should be wrecked, out of stern, cast they four anchors,and began praying that day might dawn.

30. But, when, the sailors, were seeking to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, by pretext, as though out of the prow they had been about to reach anchors,

31. Paul said unto the centurion, and unto the soldiersExcept, these, abide in the ship, ye yourselves, cannot be saved!

32. Then, the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.

33. And, until day was about to dawn, Paul continued to beseech one and all to take some food, sayingThis day is, the fourteenth day, that, suspense, fasting, ye are completing,having helped yourselves, to nothing.

34. Wherefore, I beseech you to take some food,for, this, lays a foundation for your safety; for, of no one of you, shall a hair of the head perish.

35. And, having said these things, and taken a loaf, he gave thanks unto God before all, and, breaking it, began to eat.

36. And, all becoming, of good cheer, they also, helped themselves to food.

37. Now we were, in the ship, in all, about seventy-six souls.

38. And, when they were satisfied with food, they began lightening the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea.

39. And, when day came, they could not recognise, the land; but perceived, a certain bay, having a beach,upon which they were minded, if they could, safely to bring the ship.

40. And, casting off the anchors, they let them go into the sea,at the same time, loosening the lashings of the rudders, and, hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.

41. But, falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and, the foreship sticking fast, remained immoveable, while, the stern, began to break up, from the violence   .

42. Now, the soldiers counsel, turned out to be, that they should kill, the prisoners, lest any one should swim out and escape;

43. but, the centurion, being minded to bring Paul safely through, hindered them of their purpose, and ordered such as were able to swim, to cast themselves overboard and, get first to the land,

44. and, the rest, some, on planks, and, some, on other things from the ship, and, so, it came to pass, that, all, were brought safely through, on to the land.

## Acts 28

1. And, when we were safely through, then, we knew that the island was called, Melita.

2. And, the natives, began to shew us no common philanthropy; for, kindling a fire, they received us all, because of the rain that had set in, and because of the cold.

3. But, when Paul had gathered a certain lot of firewood into a bundle, and laid it on the fire, a viper, by reason of the heat, coming forth, fastened on his hand.

4. And, when the natives saw the brute hanging out from his hand, they began to say, one to anotherDoubtless, this man is, a murderer, whom, though brought safely through out of the sea, Justice, hath not suffered, to live.

5. He, however, shaking of the brute into the fire, suffered no harm;

6. whereas, they, were expecting, that he was about to become inflamed, or to fall down suddenly dead;but, when they had been long expecting, and had observed, nothing unusual, happening unto him, they changed their minds, and began to say he was a god.

7. Now, in the neighbourhood of that place, were lands, belonging to the chief man of the island, by name Publius,who, making us welcome, for three days, hospitably entertained us.

8. And it so happened that, the father of Publius, with feverish heats and dysentery distressed, was lying prostrate: unto whom Paul entering in and praying, laid his hands on him, and healed him.

9. And, when this happened, the rest also, even they in the island who were sick, were coming in and getting cured;

10. who also, with many honours, honoured us, and, when we were about to sail, put on board such things as we might need.

11. And, after three months, we sailed in a ship which had wintered in the island,   of Alexandria, whose ensign was The Twin Brothers;

12. and, touching at Syracuse, we tarried three days;

13. whence, going round, we reached Rhegium; and, after one day, a south wind springing up, on the second day, we came to Puteoli;

14. where, finding brethren, we were entreated to tarry, with them, seven days;and, thus, towards Rome, we came.

15. And, when from thence the brethren heard the tidings concerning us, they came to meet us, as far as The Market of Appius and the Three Tavernsseeing whom, Paul thanked God, and took courage.

16. And, when we entered into Rome, Paul was suffered to abide by himself, with the soldier that guarded him.

17. And it came to pass, after three days, that he called together those who were the chief of the Jews; and, when they came together, he began to say unto themI, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, as a prisoner, out of Jerusalem, was delivered into the hands of the Romans;

18. who, indeed, when they had examined me, were minded to set me at liberty, because there was, nothing worthy of death, in me.

19. But, as the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar,not as though, against my nation, I had anything to bring by way of accusation.

20. For this cause, therefore, have I called for you, to see and to speak with you; for, on account of the hope of Israel, this chain, have I about me!

21. And, they, said unto himWe, have neither received letters concerning thee from the Jews, nor hath anyone of the brethren who hath arrived reported or spoken concerning thee, anything ill.

22. But we deem it well, that, from thee, we should hear what are thine opinions; for, indeed, concerning this sect, it is, known to us, that, everywhere, is it spoken against.

23. And, having arranged with him a day, there came unto him, to the lodging, a larger number; unto whom he proceeded to expound, bearing full witness as to the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses, and from the prophets,from morning till evening.

24. And, some, indeed, were persuaded by the things that were spoken, whereas, others, disbelieved;

25. and, not being, agreed, among themselves, they began to leave,Paul having said one thingWell, did, the Holy Spirit, speak through Isaiah the prophet, unto your fathers,

26. sayingGo thy way unto this people, and sayYe shall, surely hear, and yet will in nowise understand. And, surely see, and yet will in nowise perceive;

27. For the heart of this people, hath become dense, and, with their ears, heavily, have they heard, and, their eyes, have they closed,lest once they should see with their eyes, and, with their ears, should hear, and, with their hearts, should understand, and return,when I would certainly heal them.

28. Be it, known unto you, therefore, that, unto the nations, hath been sent forth this salvation of God: they, will also hear.

29. fehlt

30. And he abode two whole years in his own hired house, and made welcome all who were coming in unto him,

31. proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom of speech, without hindrance.
