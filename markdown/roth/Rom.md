## Romans 1

__and, the rest, some, on planks, and, some, on other things from the ship, and, so, it came to pass, that, all, were brought safely through, on to the land.__

1. Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, a called apostle, separated unto the glad-message of God

2. Which he promised beforehand, through his prophets, in holy scriptures

3. Concerning his Son,who came to be of the seed of David, according to flesh,

4. Who was distinguished as the Son of Godby power, according to a Holy Spirit, through means of a resurrection of the dead,Jesus Christ our Lord;

5. Through whom we have received favour and apostleship, for obedience of faith among all the nations, in behalf of his name,

6. Among whom are, ye also, called of Jesus Christ:

7. Unto all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints, favour unto you, and peace, from God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ.

8. First, indeed, I give thanks unto my God, through Jesus Christ, concerning you all, because your faith is being announced throughout the whole world.

9. For God is, my witness,unto whom I am rendering divine service in my spirit, in the glad message of his Son,how incessantly, I am making mention of you

10. At all times in my prayers,making supplicationif, by some means, even now, at any time, I may have a way opened, in the will of God, to come unto you;

11. For I am longing to see you, that I may impart some spiritual gift unto you, to the end ye may be established,

12. That is to saythere may be a mutual encouragement among you, each by the others faith, both yours and mine.

13. I do not wish however that ye should be ignorant, brethren, that, many times, have I purposed to come unto you, but have been hindered, until the present,in order that, some fruit, I might have among you also, even as among the other nations,

14. Both to Greeks and to Barbarians, both to wise and to unwise, a debtor, I am:

15. Thus, the eagerness on my partunto you also who are in Rome, to announce the joyful message.

16. For I am not ashamed of the joyful message; for it is Gods power unto salvation, to every one that believeth, both to Jew  first  and to Greek;

17. For, a righteousness of God, is therein revealed,by faith unto faith: even as it is writtenBut, he that is righteous, by faith, shall live.

18. For there is being revealed an anger of God from heavenagainst all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who, the truth, in unrighteousness, do hold down;

19. Inasmuch as, what may be known of God, is manifest among them, for, God, unto them, hath made it manifest,

20. For, the unseen things of him, from a worlds creation, by the things made, being perceived, are clearly seen, even his eternal power and divinity,to the end they should be without excuse;

21. Inasmuch as, having come to know God, not, as God, did they glorify him, or give him thanks, but were made fruitless in their reasonings, and darkened was their undiscerning heart,

22. Professing to be wise, they were made foolish,

23. And, exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God, for the likeness of an image of a corruptible man, and of birds and fourfooted beasts and reptiles:

24. Wherefore God gave them up in the covetings of their hearts unto impurity, so as to be dishonouring their bodies among them,

25. Who, indeed, exchanged away the truth of God for the falsehood, and rendered worship and service unto the creature rather than unto the Creator,who is blessed unto the ages. Amen!

26. For this cause, God gave them up unto dishonourable passions; for, even their females, exchanged away the natural use into that which is against nature,

27. In like manner also, even the males, leaving the natural use of the female, flamed out in their eager desire one for another, males with males, the indecency, effecting,and, the necessary recompence of their error, within themselves, duly receiving;

28. And, even as they did not approve to be holding, God, in acknowledgment, God gave them up unto a disapproved mind to be doing the things that are not becoming,

29. Filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, baseness, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil disposition,

30. Whisperers, detractors, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, vain boasters, inventors of vices, unto parents unyielding,

31. Without discernment, regardless of covenants, without natural affection, unmerciful:

32. Who, indeed, having acknowledged the righteous sentence of God,that, they who such things as these do practise, are worthy of death, not only, the same things, are doing, but are even delighting together with them who are practising

## Romans 2

1. Wherefore, inexcusable, thou art, O man, whoever judgest; for, wherein thou judgest some one else, thyself, thou dost condemn,for, the very things, thou dost practise, who art judging:

2. We know, however, that, the sentence of God, is according to truth against them who, such things as these, do practise.

3. And reckonest thou this, O manwho dost judge them who such things do practise, and yet art doing the same, that, thou, shalt escape the sentence of God?

4. Or, the riches of his kindness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, dost thou despise,not knowing that, the kindness of God, unto repentance, is leading thee?

5. But, according to thy hardness, and   impenitent heart, art treasuring up for thyself anger, in a day of anger and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,

6. Who will render unto each one according to his works:

7. Unto them, on the one hand, who, by way of endurance in good work, are seeking, glory, honour and incorruption, life age-abiding,

8. Unto them, on the other hand, who are of contention, and are not yielding unto the truth, but are yielding unto unrighteousness, anger and wrath,

9. tribulation and anguishagainst every soul of man who worketh out what is base, both of Jew first and of Greek,

10. But glory and honour and peaceunto every one who worketh what is good, both unto Jew first and unto Greek:

11. For there is no respect of persons with God;

12. For, as many as without law sinned, without law, also shall perish, and, as many as within law sinned, through law, shall be judged;

13. For, not the hearers of law, are righteous with God, but, the doers of law, shall be declared righteous;

14. For, whensoever the nations which have not law, by nature, the things of the law, may be doing, the same, not having law, unto themselves, are a law,

15. Who, indeed, shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience therewith bearing witness, and, between one another, their reasonings accusingor, even excusing, them:

16. In the day on which God judgeth the secrets of men according to my glad-message through Christ Jesus.

17. If, however, thou, art taking the name of Jew, and resting thyself upon law, and boasting in God,

18. And art taking note of his will, and testing the things that differwhen receiving oral instruction out of the law,

19. Art persuaded, moreover, that, thou thyself, arta guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,

20. A trainer of the simple, a teacher of babes, having the forming of knowledge and truth in the law,

21. Thou, therefore, that art teaching someone else, thyself, art thou not teaching? Thou that proclaimestDo not steal! Art thou, stealing?

22. That sayestDo not commit adultery! Art thou, committing adultery? That abhorrest sacrilege, Art thou, robbing temples?

23. That in law dost boast, Through the transgression of the law, art thou dishonouring God?

24. For the name of God, because of you, is defamed among the nations,even as it is written.

25. For, circumcision, indeed, profitethif, law, thou be practising; but, if thou be a transgressor of law, thy circumcision, hath become, uncircumcision

26. If then, the uncircumcision, be guarding the righteous requirement of the law, shall not, his uncircumcision, as circumcision be reckoned?

27. And the uncircumcision by nature, completing the law, shall judge, thee, who, notwithstanding letter and circumcision, art a transgressor of law!

28. For, not he who is one in appearance, is a Jew, nor is, that which is such in appearance in flesh, circumcision;

29. But, he who is one in secret, is a Jew,and,

## Romans 3

1. What, then, is the preeminence of the Jew? Or what, the profit of his circumcision?

2. Much, every way:First, indeed, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God.

3. For what? If some distrusted, shall their distrust make, the trust of God, void?

4. Far be it! But let, God, prove to be, true, albeit, every man, be false! Even as it is writtenThat thou mightest be declared righteous in thy words, and overcome when thou art in judgment.

5. But, if, our unrighteousness, commendeth, Gods righteousness, what shall we say? Surely, not unrighteous, is God who visiteth with his anger? After the manner of men, I am speaking,

6. Far be it! Else how shall God judge the world?

7. But, if, the truth of God, by my falsehood, hath the more abounded unto his glory, why, any longer, am, even I, as a sinner, to be judged?

8. And why not, according as we are injuriously charged,  and  according as some affirm that we say, Let us do the bad things, that the good ones may come? whose sentence is, just.

9. What then? do we screen ourselves? Not at all! For we have before accused both Jews and Greeks of being, all under sin;

10. Even as it is writtenthere is none righteous, not even one,

11. There is none that discerneth, There is none that seeketh out God:

12. All, have turned aside, together, have become useless, There is none that doeth kindness, not so much as one:

13. A sepulchre opened, is their throat, with their tongues, have they used deceit, the poison of asps, is under their lips,

14. Whose mouth, of cursing and bitterness, is full,

15. Swift, are their feet to shed blood;

16. Destruction and misery, are in their ways,

17. And, the way of peace, have they not known:

18. There is no fear of God before their eyes.

19. Now we know that, whatsoever things the law saith, to them who are within the law, it speaketh, in order that, every mouth, may be stopped and all the world come, under penal sentence, unto God.

20. Inasmuch as, by works of law, shall no flesh be declared righteous before him,through law, in fact, is discovery of sin.

21. But now, apart from law, a righteousness of God hath been manifested, borne witness to by the law and the prophets,

22. A righteousness of God, through faith in  Jesus  Christ, unto all that have faith; for there is no distinction,

23. For, all, have sinned and fall short of the glory of God;

24. Being declared righteous freely by his favour through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:

25. Whom God hath set forth as a propitiatory covering, through faith in his blood, for a showing forth of his righteousness, by reason of the passing-by of the previously committed sins,

26. In the forbearance of God,with a view to a showing forth of his righteousness in the present season, that he might be righteous even when declaring righteous him that hath faith in Jesus.

27. Where, then, the boasting! It is excluded. Through what kind of law? Of works? Nay! but through a law of faith:

28. For we reckon that a man is to be declared righteous by faith, apart from works of law.

29. Or,   the God, of Jews only, and not of the nations also? Yea! of the nations also:

30. If, at all events, God is one, who will declare righteousthe circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through their faith.

31. Do we then make, law, void through means of our faith? Far be it! On the contrary, law, we do establish!

## Romans 4

1. What then shall we sayas touching Abraham our forefather?

2. For, if Abraham by works was declared righteous, he hath whereof to boast;nevertheless, not towards God,

3. For what doth the Scripture say? And Abraham believed in God, and it was reckoned unto him as righteousness.

4. Now, unto him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned by way of favour but by way of obligation,

5. Whereas, unto him that worketh not but believeth on him that declareth righteous the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness.

6. Just as David also affirmeth the happiness of the man unto whom God reckoneth righteousness apart from works:

7. Happy, they whose lawlessnesses have been forgiven and whose sins have been covered,

8. Happy, the man whose sin the Lord will in nowise reckon.

9. This happiness, then,   for the circumcision, or for the uncircumcision? for we sayHis faith was reckoned unto Abraham as righteousness:

10. How, then, was it reckoned? When he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision;

11. And, a sign, he received   of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while yet uncircumcised; to the end he might be father of all that believe during uncircumcision, to the end  the same  righteousness might be reckoned unto them,

12. And father of circumcisionunto them who are not of circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of the faith, while yet uncircumcised, of our father Abraham.

13. For, not through means of law, doth the promise belong unto Abraham or unto his seed,that he should be heir of thee world; but, through a righteousness by faith.

14. For, if they who are of law are heirs, made void is faith and of no effect is the promise.

15. For, the law, worketh out anger, but, where there is no law, neither is there transgression.

16. For this cause, it is by faith, in order that it may be by way of favour, so that the promise is firm unto all the seed,not unto that by the law only, but unto that also

17. Even as it is writtenFather of many nations, have I appointed thee: before him whom he believedGod, who causeth the dead to live, and calleth the things that are not as things that are:

18. Who, past hope, upon hope believed, so that he became father of many nations,according to what had been saidSo shall be thy seed;

19. And, without becoming weak in his faith, he attentively considered his own body, already deadenedhe being a hundred years old, the deadening also of Sarahs womb;

20. In respect, however, of the promise of God, he was not led to hesitate by unbelief, but received power by his faith, giving glory unto God,

21. And being fully persuaded (that),what he hath promised, able is he also to perform:

22. Wherefore  also , it was reckoned unto him as righteousness.

23. Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was reckoned unto him,

24. But for our sakes alsounto whom it is to be reckoned,even unto them that believe upon him who raised Jesus our Lord from among the dead:

25. Who was delivered up on account of our offences and was raised on account of the declaring us righteous.

## Romans 5

1. Having, therefore, been declared righteous by faith, let us have, peace, towards God, through our Lord Jesus Christ,

2. Through whom also we have had, our introduction,  by our faith  into this favour wherein we stand; and let us boast in hope of the glory of God.

3. And, not only so, but let us boast also in our tribulations; knowing that, our tribulation, worketh out endurance.

4. And, our endurance, a testing, and, our testing, hope,

5. And, our hope, putteth not to shame. Because, the love of God, hath been poured out in our hearts, through the Holy Spirit that hath been given unto us:

6. Seeing that, Christ, we being weak as yet, seasonably, in behalf of such as were ungodly, died.

7. For, scarcely in behalf of a righteous man, will one die,in behalf of the good man indeed, peradventure one even dareth to die;

8. But God commendeth his own love unto us in thatwe as yet being sinners, Christ in our behalf died.

9. Much more, then, having now been declared righteous by his blood, shall we be saved through him from the anger.

10. For, if being enemies we were reconciled unto God through the death of his Son, much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.

11. And, not only, so, but are even boasting in God, through our Lord Jesus  Christ ,through whom, now, the reconciliation we have received.

12. For this cause,just as, through one man, sin into the world entered, and through sin, death,and, so, unto all men death passed through, for that all had sinned;

13. For, until law, sin was in the world, although sin is not reckoned when there is no law,

14. Yet still, death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over them who had not sinned after the likeness of the transgression of Adam,who is a type of the Coming One;

15. But, not as the fault, so,  also  the decree of favour, for, if, by the fault of the one, the many died, much more, the favour of God and the free-gift in favour, by the one man Jesus Christ, unto the many superabounded;

16. And, not as through one that sinned, is that which is freely given, for, the sentence of judgment, indeed, wasout of one   into condemnation, whereas, the decree of favour, isout of many faults, into a recovery of righteousness.

17. For, if, by the fault of the one, death reigned through the one, much more, they who the superabundance of the favour and of  the free-gift of  the righteousness do receive, in life, shall reign through the one, Jesus Christ.

18. Hence then, as through one fault,   is unto all men for righteous acquittal unto life;

19. For, just as, through the disobedience of the one man, sinners, the many were constituted, so, also, through the obedience of the one, righteous, the many shall be constituted

20. Law, however, gained admission, in order that the fault might abound, but, where the sin abounded, the favour greatly superabounded:

21. In order thatjust as sin reigned in death, so, also, favour, might reign through righteousness unto life age-abiding, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

## Romans 6

1. What then shall we say? are we still to continue in sin that favour may abound?

2. Far be it! we who have died unto sin, how, any longer, shall we live therein?

3. Or know ye not that, we, as many as were immersed into Christ  Jesus , into his death were immersed?

4. We were, therefore, buried together with him through our immersion into his death, in order thatjust as Christ was raised from among the dead through the glory of the Father, so, we also, in newness of life should walk.

5. For, if we have come to be grown together in the likeness of his death, certainly, in that of his resurrection also, shall we be.

6. Of this taking notethat, our old man, was crucified together with him in order that the sinful body might be made powerless, that we should, no longer, be in servitude to sin;

7. For, he that hath died, hath become righteously acquitted from his sin.

8. Now, if we have died together with Christ, we believe that we shall also live together with him;

9. Knowing that, Christ having been raised from among the dead, no more dieth,death, over him, no more, hath lordship,

10. For, in that he died, unto sin, died he once for all, but, in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.

11. So, ye also, be reckoning yourselves to bedead indeed unto sin, but, alive unto God in Christ Jesus.

12. Let not sin, therefore, reign in your death-doomed body, that ye should be obedient to its covetings;

13. Neither be presenting your members as weapons of unrighteousness unto sin, but present yourselves unto God as though alive from among the dead, and your members as weapons of righteousness unto God;

14. For, sin, over you, shall not have lordship, for ye are not under law, but under favour.

15. What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under law but under favour? Far be it!

16. Know ye not that, unto whom ye are presenting yourselves as servants for obedience, servants ye are unto   whom ye are obedient, whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness?

17. But thanks be unto God, thatwhereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient out of the heart unto the mould of teaching into which ye were delivered;

18. And, being freed from sin, ye were made servants unto righteousness;

19. In human fashion am I speaking, because of the weakness of your flesh;for, just as ye presented your members as servants unto impurity and unto lawlessness  for lawlessness , so now, present ye your members as servants unto righteousness for sanctification.

20. For, when ye were servants of sin, ye were free as to righteousness;

21. What fruit, therefore, had ye thenin things for which ye now are taking shame to yourselves? For, the end of those things, is death.

22. Whereas, now, having been freed from sin, and made servants unto God, ye have your fruit for sanctification and, the end, life age-abiding.

23. For, the wages of sin, is death; but, Gods gift of favour, is life age-abiding, in Christ Jesus our Lord.

## Romans 7

1. Or are ye ignorant, brethren,for unto them that understand the law am I speaking, that, the law, hath lordship over a men as long as he liveth?

2. For, the married woman, unto her living husband is bound by law; but, if her husband have died, she hath received a full release from the law of her husband.

3. Hence then, her husband being alive, an adulteress, shall she be calledif she become another mans, but, if the husband have died, she is free from the law; so that she is not an adulteress, though she become another mans.

4. So, then, my brethren, ye also, were made dead unto the law through the body of the Christ, to the end ye might become anothershis who from among the dead was raised, in order that we might bring forth fruit unto God.

5. For, when we were in the flesh, the susceptibilities of sins which were through the law, used to be energized in our members unto the bringing forth of fruit unto death;

6. But, now, we have received full release from the law, by dying

7. What, then, shall we say? Is the law sin? Far be it! On the contrary, I had not discovered, sin, save through law, for even, of coveting, I had not been aware if, the law, had not kept on sayingThou shall not covet;

8. Howbeit sin taking, occasionthrough the commandment, wrought out in me all manner of coveting; for, apart from law, sin is dead;

9. And, I, was alive, apart from law, at one time, but, the commandment coming, sin sprang up to life,

10. Whereas, I, died,and the commandment which was unto life was found by me to be, itself, unto death;

11. For, sin,taking occasionthrough the commandment, completely deceived me and, through it, slew me:

12. So that, the law, indeed, is holy, and the commandment, holy, and righteous and good.

13. Did, then, that which is good, unto me become death? Far be it! But

14. For we know that, the law, is spiritual,I, however, am a creature of flesh, sold under sin;

15. For, that which I am working out, I do not approve,for not, what I wish, the same I practise, but, what I hate, the same I do:

16. Now, if what I wish not the same I do, I consent unto the law that   right.

17. Now, however, no longer am, I, working it out, but the, sin, that dwelleth in me:

18. I know, in fact, that there dwelleth not in me, that is, in my flesh, anything good; for, the wishing, lieth near me, but, the working out of what is right, not!

19. For not, the good that I wish, I do, but, the evil that I do not wish, the same I practise.

20. Now, if what I wish not, the same, I do, no longer am, I, working it out, but the, sin, that dwelleth in me.

21. Hence, I find the law, to me who wish to be doing the right, that, unto me, the wrong lieth near:

22. I have, in fact, a sympathetic pleasure in the law of God; according to the inner man.

23. But I behold a diverse law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and taking me captive in the law of sin which existeth in my members:

24. Wretched, man am, I! Who shall rescue me out of this body doomed to death?

25.  But  thanks be unto God!Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Hence, then,I myself, with the mind, indeed, am in servitude unto a law of God; but; with the flesh; unto a law of sin.

## Romans 8

1. Hence there is now, no, condemnation unto them who are in Christ Jesus;

2. For, the-law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus, hath set thee free from the law of sin and of death;

3. For, what was impossible by the law in that it was weak through the flesh, God, by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh,

4. In order that, the righteous requirement of the law, might be fulfilled in uswho, not according to flesh, do walk, but according to spirit;

5. For, they who according to flesh have their being, the things of the flesh do prefer, but, they according to the spirit, the things of the spirit;

6. For, what is preferred by the flesh,   life and peace;

7. Inasmuch as, what is preferred by the flesh,   hostile towards God, for, unto the law of God, it doth not submit itself, neither in fact can it.

8. They, moreover, who in flesh have their being, cannot please, God.

9. But, ye, have not your being in flesh, but in spirit,if at least, Gods Spirit, dwelleth in you; and, if anyone hath not Christs Spirit, the same, is not his;

10. But, if Christ is in you, the body, indeed, is dead by reason of sin, whereas, the spirit, is life by reason of righteousness;

11. If, moreover, the Spirit of him that raised Jesus from among the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised from among the dead Christ Jesus, shall make alive  even  your death-doomed bodies, through means of his indwelling Spirit within you.

12. Hence, then, brethrendebtors, we are, not unto the flesh, that, according to flesh, we should live,

13. For, if according to flesh ye live, ye are about to die, whereas, if in spirit, the practices of the flesh, ye are putting to death, ye shall attain unto life;

14. For, as many as by Gods Spirit are being led, the same, are Gods sons,

15. For ye have not received a spirit of servitude, leading back into fear, but ye have received a spirit of sonship, whereby we are exclaimingAbba! Oh Father!

16. The Spirit itself, beareth witness together with our spirit that we are children of God;

17. And, if children, heirs alsoheirs, indeed, of God, but co-heirs with Christ,if, at least, we are suffering together, in order that we may also be glorified together.

18. For I reckon that unworthy are the sufferings of the present season to be compared with the glory about to be revealed towards us;

19. For, the eager outlook of creation, ardently awaiteth the revealing of the sons of God,

20. For, unto vanity, hath creation been made subjectnot by choice, but by reason of him that made it subject, in hope

21. That, creation itself also, shall be freedfrom the bondage of the decay into the freedom of the glory of the sons of God;

22. For we know that, all creation, is sighing together, and travailing-in-birth-throes together until the present,

23. And, not only so, but, we ourselves, also, who have the first-fruit of the Spirit we  even ourselves, within our own selves do sigh,sonship ardently awaitingthe redeeming of our body;

24. For, by our hope, have we been saved,but, hope beheld, is not hope, for, what one beholdeth, why doth he hope for?

25. If, however, what we do not behold we hope for, with endurance, are we ardently awaiting

26. In the selfsame way moreover, even the Spirit, helpeth together in our weakness,for, what we should pray for as we ought, we know not, but, the Spirit itself, maketh intercession with sighings unutterable,

27. And, he that searcheth the hearts, knoweth what is preferred by the Spiritthat, according to God, he maketh intercession in behalf of saints;

28. We know, further, that, unto them who love God, God causeth all things to work together for good,unto them who, according to purpose, are such as he hath called;

29. For, whom he fore-approved, he also fore-appointed to be conformed unto the image of his Son, that he might be firstborn among many brethren,

30. And, whom he fore-appointed, the same, he also called, and, whom he called, the same, he also declared righteous, and, whom he declared righteous, the same, he also made glorious:

31. What, then, shall we say to a these things? If God   against us?

32. He, at least, who his own Son did not spare, but in behalf of us all delivered him up, how shall he not also, with him, all things upon us in favour bestow?

33. Who shall bring an accusation against the chosen ones of God? God, who declareth righteous?

34. Who is he that condemneth? Christ  Jesus  who died?Nay! rather was raised  from among the dead ,who is on the right hand of God, who also is making intercession in our behalf?

35. Who shall separate us from the love of the Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?

36. According as it is writtenFor thy sake, are we being put to death all the day long, we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter.

37. Nay, in all these things, we are more than conquering through him that hath loved us.

38. For I am persuaded thatneither death nor life, nor messengers nor principalities, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,

39. Nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

## Romans 9

1. Truth, say I, in Christ, I utter no falsehood,my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit,

2. That I have great grief and incessant travail in my heart;

3. For I could have wished to be accursed, even I myself, from the Christ, in behalf of my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh;

4. Who, indeed, are Israelites, whose are the sonship, and the glory, and the covenants, and the legislation, and the divine service, and the promises,

5. Whose are the fathers, and of whom is the Christaccording to the fleshhe who is over all, God, blessed unto the ages. Amen.

6. It is not, however, as though the word of God had failed; for, not all they who are of Israel, the same are Israel.

7. Neither, because they are seed of Abraham, are all children,but, In Isaac, shall there be called unto thee a seed.

8. That isnot the children of the flesh, the same are children of God; but, the children of the promise, are reckoned as a seed.

9. For, of promise, is this wordAccording to this season, will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.

10. And, not only so, but, when, Rebekah also, was with child, of oneIsaac our father,

11. They, in fact, not being yet born, nor having practised anything good or bad,in order that the purpose of God by way of election might stand,not by works but by him that was calling,

12. It was said unto herThe elder, shall serve the younger;

13. Even as it is writtenJacob, have I loved, but, Esau, have I hated.

14. What, then, shall we say? Is there injustice with God? Far be it!

15. For, unto Moses, he saithI will have mercy upon whomsoever I can have mercy, and I will have compassion upon whomsoever I can have compassion.

16. Hence, then, it is nor of him that wisheth nor of him that runneth, but of the mercy-shewing God.

17. For the Scripture saith unto PharaohUnto this end, have I raised thee up, that I may thus shew in thee my power, and that I may declare my name in all the earth.

18. Hence, then,on whom he pleaseth, he hath mercy, and, whom he pleaseth, he doth harden.

19. Thou wilt say to me, thenWhy longer findeth he fault? For, his purpose, who hath withstood?

20. O man! Who, nevertheless, art, thou, that art answering again unto God? Shall the thing formed say unto him that formed itWhy didst thou make me thus?

21. Or hath not the potter a right over the clayout of the same lump, to make some, indeed, into a vessel for honour, and some for dishonour?

22. And, if Godwishing to shew his anger and to make known his powerbare, in much patience, with vessels of anger already fitted for destruction,

23. In order that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy which he prepared beforehand for glory,

24. Whom he also called, even us, not only from among Jews, but also from among the nations,

25. As also in Hosea he saithI will call the not-my-people, My people, and the not-beloved, beloved,

26. And it shall bein the place where it was said  to them not my people are, ye! there, shall they be calledSons of a Living God.

27. Isaiah, moreover, exclaimeth over IsraelThough the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant, shall be saved;

28. For, a complete and concise account, will the Lord make upon the earth.

29. And, even as Isaiah hath before said,If, the Lord of hosts, had not left us a seed, as Sodom, had we become, and, as Gomorrha, had we been made like.

30. What, then, shall we say? That, they of the nations, who were not in pursuit of righteousness, have laid hold of righteousness,a righteousness, however, which is by faith;

31. Whereas, Israel, though in pursuit of a law of righteousness, unto a law, have not attained.

32. Wherefore? Because, not by faith but as by works,   : they have stumbled at the stone of stumbling,

33. Even as it is writtenLo! I lay in Zion, a stone to strike against and a rock to stumble over, and, he that resteth faith thereupon, shall not be put to shame.

## Romans 10

1. Brethren! the delight of my own heart and my supplication God-ward in their behalf, are for salvation;

2. For I bear them witness that they have, a zeal for God,but not according to correct knowledge;

3. For, not knowing Gods righteousness and, their own, seeking to establish, unto the righteousness of God, have they not submitted;

4. For Christ is an end of law, for righteousness, unto every one that believeth.

5. For, Moses, writeth thatas touching the righteousness that is by law, The man that hath done   , shall live thereby;

6. Whereas, the righteousness by faith, thus speakethDo not say in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? That is, to bring, Christ, down,

7. Or, Who shall descend into the abyss? That is, to bring up, Christ, from among the dead;

8. But what saith it? Near thee, is the declaration, In thy mouth and in thy heart,that is, the declaration of the faith, which we proclaim:

9. That, if thou shalt confess the declaration with thy mouthThat Jesus is, Lord, and shalt believe with thy hearThat, God, raised him from among the dead, thou shalt be saved;

10. For, in heart, it is to be believed unto righteousness, and, by mouth, it is to be confessed unto salvation.

11. For the scripture saithNo one that resteth faith thereupon, shall be put to shame?

12. For there is no distinctionof Jew or Greek,for, the same   , is Lord of all, being rich unto all who call upon him;

13. For, Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved:

14. How, then, shall men call upon one in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in one of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear, without one to proclaim?

15. And how shall they proclaim, except they be sent? Even as it is writtenHow beautiful the feet of them that bring glad tidings of good things!

16. But, not all, have become obedient unto the glad tidings;for, Isaiah, saithLord! who believed what we have heard?

17. Hence, our faith, cometh by something heard, and, that which is heard, through a declaration of Christ.

18. But I say: Have they not heard? Yea indeed,into all the earth, hath gone forth their sound, and, unto the ends of the inhabited world, their declarations.

19. But I say: Hath, Israel, not come to know? First, Moses, saithI, will provoke you to jealousy on account of a no-nation, on account of an undiscerning nation, will I make you very angry.

20. Isaiah, however, waxeth daring, and saith,I have been found by them who after me were not seeking, manifest have I become unto them who for me were not enquiring;

21. Whereas, regarding Israel, he saithAll day long, have I stretched forth my hands unto a people unyielding and contradicting.

## Romans 11

1. I say, thenHath God cast off his people? Far be it! For, I also, am an Israelite,of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin:

2. God hath not cast off his people, whom he fore approved. Or know ye not, in   Elijah what the scripture saith, when he intercedeth with God against Israel?

3. Lord! Thy prophets, have they slain, thine altars, have they overthrown, and, I, am left alone, and they are seeking my life!

4. But what saith unto him the response? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who, indeed, have not bowed a knee unto Baal.

5. Thus, then, in the present season also, a remnant, by way of an election of favour, hath come into being.

6. If, however, by favour, no longer of works; else, favour, no longer proveth to be favour!

7. What then? That which Israel seeketh after, the same, it hath not obtained:the election, however, have obtained it, and, the rest, have been hardened;

8. Even as it is writtenGod hath given unto them a spirit of stupor,eyes not to see, and ears not to hear,until this very day;

9. And, David, saithLet their table be turned into a snare, and into gin, and into a trap, and into a recompense unto them,

10. Darkened be their eyes, not to see, and, their back, do thou continually bow down.

11. I say thenDid they stumble in order that they might fall? Far be it! But, by their fall, salvation   unto the nations, to the end of provoking them to jealousy.

12. If, moreover, their fail, is the riches of a world, and their loss, the riches of nations, how much rather their fullness?

13. Unto you, however, am I speaking,you of the nations; inasmuch, indeed, then, as, I, am an apostle to the nations, my ministry, I glorify,

14. If by any means I may provoke to jealousy my own flesh, and save some from among them;

15. For, if, the casting away of them, hath become the reconciling of a world, what shall, the taking of them in addition, be, but life from among the dead?

16. If, moreover, the first fruit   also.

17. If, however, some of the branches, have been broken out, and, thou, being a wild olive hast been grafted in among them, and hast become a joint partaker of the root of the fatness of the olive,

18. Be not boasting over the branches! Howbeit, if thou boast, it is not, thou, that bearest the root, but the root, thee!

19. Thou wilt say, thenBranches were broken out in order that, I, might he grafted in.

20. Well: by their want of faith, they have been broken out,and, thou, by thy faith, dost stand!Regard not lofty things, but be afraid;

21. For, if, God, hath not spared, the natural branches, neither, thee, will he spare!

22. See, then, the kindness and the severity of God: upon them who have fallen, severity,but, upon thee, the kindness of God, if thou abide still in the kindness,otherwise, thou also, shalt he cut out;

23. Whereas, they also, unless they abide still in their want of faith, shall be grafted in, for God is, able, again to engraft them!

24. For, if, thou, out of the naturally wild olive was cut out, and, beyond nature, hast been engrafted into the good olive, how much rather, shall these, the natural   be engrafted into their own olive tree?

25. For I wish not, ye should be ignorant, brethren, of this sacred secret, lest within yourselves ye be presumptuous, that, a hardening in part, hath befallen Israel, until, the full measure of the nations, shall come in;

26. And, so, all Israel shall be saved: even as it is writtenThere shall have come out of Zion the Deliverer,He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob;

27. And, this, for them, is the covenant from me, as soon as I take away their sins.

28. As touching the joyful-message, indeed, they are enemies for your sake, but, as touching the election, beloved for their fathers sake;

29. For, not to be regretted, are the gifts and the calling of God:

30. For, just as, ye, at one time had not yielded unto God, and yet now have received mercy by their refusal to yield,

31. So, these also, have now refused to yield, by your own mercy, in order that, themselves also, should now become objects of mercy;

32. For God hath shut up all together, in a refusal to yield, in order that, upon all, he may bestow mercy.

33. Oh! the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments! and untraceable his ways!

34. For who hath come to know the mind of the Lord? Or who hath become his counselor?

35. Or who hath first given unto him, and it shall be recompensed to him again?

36. Because, of him, and through him, and unto him, are all things:unto him, be the glory, unto the ages. Amen!

## Romans 12

1. I beseech you therefore, brethren, through the compassions of God, to present your bodies a living, holy sacrifice, unto God acceptable,your rational divine service;

2. And be not configuring yourselves unto this age, but be transforming yourselves by the renewing of your mind, to the end ye may be proving what is the thing willed by Godthe good and acceptable and perfect.

3. For I say, through the favour which hath been given me, unto every one who is among you,not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but so to think as to think soberlyas, unto each one, God hath dealt a measure of faith.

4. For, just as in one body we have many members, yet, all the members, have not the same office,

5. So, we, the many, are one body in Christ, yet, severally, members one of another.

6. Now, having gifts of favour, according to the favour given unto us, differingwhether prophesying,   according to the proportion of our faith,

7. Or ministering,   in his teaching,

8. Or he that exhorteth, in his exhorting, he that imparteth,   with liberality, he that taketh a lead, with diligence, he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.

9. Your love,   without hypocrisy,loathing that which is wicked, cleaving to that which is good;

10. In your brotherly love, unto one another, being tenderly affectioned, in honour, unto one another, giving preference;

11. In business, not slothful, in spirit, fervent, to the Lord, doing service,

12. In hope, rejoicing, in tribulation, enduring, in prayer, persevering,

13. With the needs of the saints, having fellowship,hospitality, pursuing.

14. Bless them that persecute, bless, and do not curse.

15. Rejoice with them that rejoice, weep with them that weep:

16. The same thing, one to another regarding,not the lofty things regarding, but, by the lowly, being led along. Be not getting presumptuous in your own opinion:

17. Unto no one, evil for evil rendering: providing honourable things before all men:

18. If possibleso far as dependeth on you, with all men being at peace:

19. Not avenging, yourselves, beloved, but give place unto their anger; for it is writtenMine, is avenging, I, will recompense;saith the Lord;

20. Butif thine enemy hunger, be feeding him, if he thirst, be giving him drink; for, this doing, coals of fire, shalt thou heap upon his head.

21. Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

## Romans 13

1. Let, every soul, unto protecting authorities be in subjection; for there is no authority save by God, and, they that are in being, have by God been arranged,

2. So that, he who rangeth himself against the authority, against the arrangement of God opposeth himself, and, they who oppose, shall unto themselves a sentence of judgment receive.

3. For, they who bear rule, are not a terror unto the good work but unto the evil. Wouldst thou not be afraid of the authority? That which is good, be thou doing, and thou shall have praise of the same;

4. For, Gods minister, is he unto thee for that which is good. But, if, that which is evil, thou be doing, be afraid! For, not in vain, the sword he beareth; for, Gods minister, he is,an avenger, unto anger, to him who practiseth what is evil.

5. Wherefore it is necessary to be in subjection,not only because of the anger, but also because of the conscience;

6. For, because of this, are ye paying tribute also,for, Gods ministers of state, they are, unto this very thing, giving constant attendance.

7. Render unto all their dues,unto whom tribute, tribute, unto whom tax, tax, unto whom fear, fear, unto whom honour, honour.

8. Nothing to any, be owingsave to be loving one another; for, he that loveth his neighbour, hath given to, law, its fulfillment.

9. For, thisThou shall not commit adultery, Thou shall not commit murder, Thou shall not steal, Thou shall not covet, and if there is any different commandment, in this word, is summed up,  namely Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

10. Love, unto ones neighbour, worketh not ill; Laws fullness, therefore, is, love.

11. And, this besides,knowing the seasonthat it is an hour already for you out of sleep to be wakened; for, now, is our salvation nearer than when we believed:

12. The night, is far spent and, the day, hath drawn near; let us, then, cast off the works of darkness,  and  let us put on the armour of light,

13. As in daytime, becomingly let us walk: not in revellings and in drunken bouts, not in chamberings and in wanton deeds, not in strife and envy;

14. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and, for the flesh, take not forethought to fulfil its covetings.

## Romans 14

1. Him that is weak in his faith, receive ye,not for disputing opinions:

2. One, indeed, hath faith to eat all things, whereas, he that is weak, eateth herbs:

3. Let not, him that eateth, despise him that eateth not, and let not, him that eateth not, judge him that eateth; for, God, hath received him.

4. Who art, thou, that judgest anothers domestic? To his own master, he standeth or falleth; he shall, however, be made to stand,for his master is able to make him stand.

5.  For , one, indeed esteemeth one day beyond another, whereas, another, esteemeth every day:let, each one, in his own mind be fully persuaded.

6. He that regardeth the day, unto the Lord, regardeth it,and, he that eateth, unto the Lord, doth eat, for he giveth thanks unto God; and, he that eateth not, unto the Lord, doth not eat and give God thanks.

7. For, none of us, unto himself liveth, and, none, unto himself dieth;

8. For both, if we live, unto the Lord, we live, and, if we die, unto the Lord, we die; whether therefore we live, the Lords, we are; or whether we die, the Lords, we are;

9. For, to this end, Christ died and lived, in order that, both of dead and living, he might have lordship.

10. But, thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? Aye! and thou, why dost thou despise thy brother? For, all of us, shall present ourselves unto the judgment seat of God;

11. For it is writtenLiving am, I, saith the Lord, unto me, shall bow every knee, and, every tongue, shall openly confess unto God.

12. Hence,  then , each one of us, of himself shall give account unto God.

13. No longer, then, upon one another, let us be sitting in judgment, but, this, judge ye rathernot to be putting a cause of stumbling before your brother or an occasion to fall.

14. I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesusthat, nothing, is profane of itself,save to him who reckoneth anything to be profane, unto that man,   profane,

15. If, in fact, because of food, thy brother is being grieved, no longer, by the rule of love, art thou walking:do not, by thy food, that man, be destroying, on whose behalf Christ died!

16. Therefore, suffer not to be defamed, your own good thing;

17. For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in Holy Spirit;

18. For, he that in this doeth service unto the Christ, is acceptable unto God, and approved unto men.

19. Hence, then, the things pertaining to peace, let us pursue, and the things which belong to the upbuilding one of another:

20. Do not, for the sake of food, be throwing down the work of God! All things, indeed, are pure; but, ill, is it for the man who with occasion of stumbling doth eat,

21. Well, is it not to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor   whereby thy brother is caused to stumble.

22. The faith which thou hast, have to thyself before God: happy, he that bringeth not judgment upon himself by that which he approveth;

23. But, he that is in doubt, if he eat, hath condemned himself,because,

## Romans 15

1. We are bound, however, we, who are strong, the weakness of them who are not strong to be bearing, and not, unto ourselves, to give pleasure.

2. Let, each one of us, unto his neighbour give pleasurefor what is good unto upbuilding;

3. For, even the Christ, not unto himself gave pleasure, but, even as it is writtenThe reproaches of them that we reproaching thee, fell upon me:

4. Whatsoever things, in fact, were written aforetime,  all  for our own instruction were written,in order that, through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures, we might have their hope.

5. Now may, the God of the endurance and of the encouragement, give you, the same thing, to be regarding amongst one another, according to Christ Jesus;

6. In order that, with one accord, with one mouth, ye maybe glorifying the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

7. Wherefore receive ye one another, even as, Christ also, hath received us unto the glory of God:

8. For I affirm Christ to have become a minister of circumcision in behalf of the truth of God,to confirm the promises of the fathers,

9. And that, the nations, for mercy should glorify God:even as it is writtenFor this cause, will I openly confess unto thee among nations, and, unto thy name, will strike the strings;

10. And again he saithBe glad ye nations with his people;

11. And again,Be giving praise all ye nations unto the Lord, and let all the peoples repeat his praise;

12. And, again, Isaiah, saithThere shall be the root of Jesse, and he that ariseth to rule nations,upon, him, shall nations hope.

13. Now, the God of the hope, fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that ye may surpass in the hope, in the power of Holy Spirit.

14. But I am persuaded my brethren,even, I myself, concerning you: that, ye yourselves, also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also, unto one another, to be ministering admonition:

15. Howbeit, the more boldly, have I written unto you,in some measure, as bringing it back to your minds,by reason of the favour given unto me from God,

16. That I should be a public minister of Christ Jesus unto the nations, doing priestly service with the glad-message of God, in order that the offering up of the nations might prove to be acceptable, being hallowed in Holy Spirit:

17. I have, therefore,  my  boasting in Christ Jesus in the things pertaining to God,

18. For I wilt not dare to speak anything save of the things which Christ hath wrought out for himself through me for the obedience of nations,-by word and deed,

19. By the power of signs and wonders, by the power of  Holy Spirit ; so that I, from Jerusalem and in a circuit as far as Illyricum, have fulfilled the glad-message of the Christ,

20. Although, thus,as ambitious to be announcing the glad-messagenot where Christ had been named, lest, upon anothers foundation, I should be building;

21. But, even as it is writtenThey shall see unto whom had been announced no tidings concerning him, and, they who had not heard, shall understand.

22. Wherefore, also, I have been hindered these many times from coming unto you;

23. But, now, no longer having place in these regions, and having had, a longing, to come unto you a good many years,

24. As soon as I am journey to Spain,I am hoping, in fact, when journeying through to get sight of you, and by you to be set forward thither,if, with your company, I have first in some measure been satisfied.

25. But, now, I am journeying unto Jerusalem, ministering unto the saints;

26. For Macedonia and Achaia have been well-pleased to make a certain fellowship for the destitute of the saints who are in Jerusalem,

27. They have been well-pleased, indeed,and, their debtors, they are; for, if, with their spiritual things the nations have come into fellowship, they are bound also with their own carnal things to minister publicly unto them.

28. This, then, having completed, and sealed unto them this fruit, I will come back by you unto Spain:

29. And know that, when I come unto you, in the fullness of the blessing of Christ, I shall come.

30. I beseech you, moreover,  brethren , through our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers on my behalf unto God,

31. In order that I may be delivered from them who do not yield in Judaea, and, my ministry which is unto Jerusalem, may prove to be acceptable unto the saints;

32. In order that, with joy coming unto you through Gods will, I may together with you find rest.

33. Now, the God of peace, be with you all. Amen.

## Romans 16

1. And I commend to you Phoebe our sister,being a minister  also  of the assembly which is in Cenchreae;

2. In order that ye may give her welcome in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and stand by her in any matter wherein she may have need of you; for, she also, hath proved to be a defender of many, and of my own self.

3. Salute ye Prisca and Aquila, my fellow-workers in Christ Jesus,

4. Who, indeed, for my life, their own neck laid down,unto whomnot, I only, give thanks, but also all the assemblies of the nations;

5. also the assembly at their house. Salute ye Epaenetus, my beloved, who is a first-fruit of Asia unto Christ.

6. Salute Marywho, indeed, hath toiled much for you.

7. Salute Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen and my fellow-captives, who, indeed, are of note among the Apostles, who also before me had come to be in Christ.

8. Salute Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord.

9. Salute Urbanus, our fellow-worker in Christ; and Stachys, my beloved.

10. Salute Apelles, the approved in Christ. Salute them of   Aristobulus.

11. Salute Herodion, my kinsman. Salute them of   Narcissus who are in the Lord.

12. Salute Tryphaena and Tryphosa,   , who, indeed, hath toiled much in the Lord.

13. Salute Rufus, the chosen in the Lord; also his and my mother.

14. Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brethren that are with them.

15. Salute Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympus, and all the saints that are with them.

16. Salute ye one another, with a holy a kiss. All the assemblies of the Christ salute you.

17. But I beseech you, brethren, to keep an eye upon them who are causing divisions and occasions of stumbling, aside from the teaching which, ye, have learned,and be turning away from them;

18. For, they who are such, unto our Lord Christ are not doing service, but unto their own belly,and, through their smooth and flattering speech, deceive the hearts of the innocent.

19. For, your obedience, unto all hath reached,over you, therefore, I rejoice! But I wish youto be wise,  indeed , as to that which is good, yet pure, as to that which is evil.

20. Howbeit, the God of peace, will crush Satan under your feet shortly. The favour of our Lord Jesus, be with you.

21. There salute youTimothy, my fellow-worker, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen.

22. I, Tertius, who have written the epistle, salute you in the Lord.

23. There saluteth youGaius, my host and   of the whole assembly. There salute youErastus, the steward of the city, and Quartus the brother.

24. fehlt

25. Now, unto him who hath power to establish you, according to my glad-messageeven the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of a sacred secret, in age-past times kept silent,

26. But now made manifest, and through means of prophetic scriptures, according to the command of the age-abiding God, for obedience of faith unto all the nations made known,

27. Unto a God, wise alone, through Jesus Christ,  unto whom  be the glory, unto the ages. Amen.
