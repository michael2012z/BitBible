## 1 Corinthians 1

__Now, the God of peace, be with you all. Amen.__

1. Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ, through Gods will,and Sosthenes the brother,

2. Unto the assembly of God which is in Corinth, sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints,with all who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, in every place,their Lord and ours:

3. Favour unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and Lord Jesus Christ.

4. I give thanks unto my God, at all times, concerning you, by reason of the favour of God given unto you in Christ Jesus,

5. That, in everything, ye have been enriched in himin all discourse and in all knowledge;

6. Even as, the witness of the Christ, hath been confirmed in you,

7. So that ye come short in no gift of favour,ardently awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ:

8. Who will also confirm you unto the end, unaccusable in the day of our Lord Jesus  Christ :

9. Faithful, is God, through whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.

10. But I beseech you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,that, the same thing, ye, all, be saying, and that there be not, among you, divisions; but that ye be fitly joined togetherin the same mind, and in the same judgment.

11. For it hath been signified unto me, concerning you, my brethren,by them who are of   Chloe,that there are strifes among you,

12. Now I mean this,that, each one of you, is sayingI, indeed, am of Paul, but, I, of Apollos, but, I, of Cephas, but, I, of Christ:

13. The Christ is divided! Was, Paul, crucified for you? Or, into the name of Paul, were ye immersed?

14. I give thanks, that, none of you, did I immersesave Crispus and Gaius,

15. Lest any should sayinto my own name, I immersed:

16. Yea! I immersed the house of Stephanas also,besides, I know not whether, anyone else, I immersed.

17. For Christ sent me not, to be immersing, but to be telling the good news,not with wisdom of discourse, lest, void should be made, the cross of the Christ.

18. For, the discourse which concerneth the cross, unto them, indeed, who are perishing, is, foolishness; but, unto them who are being savedunto us, it is, Gods power.

19. For it is writtenI will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and, the discernment of the discerning, will I set aside.

20. Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this age? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?

21. For, seeing that, in the wisdom of God, the world, through its wisdom, did not get to knew God, God was well-pleasedthrough the foolishness of the thing proclaimed, to save them that believe.

22. Seeing that both, Jews for signs, do ask, and, Greeks for wisdom, do seek,

23. Whereas, we, proclaim a Christ who hath been crucified,unto Jews, indeed, an occasion of stumbling, and, unto Gentiles, foolishness;

24. But, unto the called themselvesboth Jews and Greeks, Christ, Gods power, and, Gods wisdom.

25. Because, Gods foolish thing, is, wiser than men, and, Gods weak thing, mightier than men.

26. For be looking at the calling of you, brethren,that   not many wise, according to flesh. Not many powerful, not many high-born:

27. On the contrarythe foolish things of the world, hath God chosen, that he might put to shame them who are wise, and, the weak things of the world, hath God chosen, that he might put to shame the things that are mighty,

28. And, the low-born things of the world, and the things that are despised, hath God chosen, and  the things that are not,that, the things that are, he might bring to nought;

29. So that no flesh should boast before God.

30. But, of him, are, ye, in Christ Jesus, who hath been made wisdom unto us, from God,both righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:

31. In order that, even as it is writtenHe that boasteth, in the Lord, let him boast.

## 1 Corinthians 2

1. I, therefore, brethren, when I came unto you, came, not with excellency of discourse or wisdom, declaring unto you the mystery of God;

2. For I had not determined to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ,and, him, as one who had been crucified!

3. I, therefore in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling, came to be with you,

4. And, my discourse, and what I proclaimed, were not in suasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of Spirit and power:

5. In order that, your faith, might not be in mens wisdom, but in Gods power.

6. Wisdom, however, we do speak, among the full-grown,wisdom, indeed, not of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are to come to nought;

7. But we speak, Gods, wisdom, in a sacred secret, that hidden   , which God marked out beforehand, before the ages, for our glory,

8. Which, none of the rulers of this age had come to know, for, had they known, not, in that case, the Lord of the glory, would they have crucified!

9. But, even as it is writtenThe things which eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, and upon the heart of man have not come up,whatsoever things God hath prepared for them that love him,

10. Unto us, in fact, hath God revealed through the Spirit; for, the Spirit, into all things, maketh search, yea! the deep things of God.

11. For who of men knoweth the things of a man,save the spirit of the man that is in him? thus, even the things of God, hath no one come to know, save the Spirit of God.

12. But, as for us,not the spirit of the world, have we received, but the Spirit which is of God,that we might know the things which, by God, have been given in favour unto us:

13. Which we also speaknot in words taught of human wisdom, but in such as are taught of   Spirit, by spiritual words, spiritual things, explaining.

14. But, a man of the soul, doth not welcome the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, and he cannot get to know them, because, spiritually, are they examined;

15. But, the man of the spirit, on the one hand, examineth all things, but, on the other, he himself, by no one, is examined.

16. For who hath come to know the mind of the Lord, that shall instruct him? But, we, have, the mind of Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 3

1. I, therefore, brethren, have not been able to speak unto you, as unto men of the Spirit, but as unto men of the fleshas unto babes in Christ:

2. With milk, have I fed you, not, with meat; for, not yet, have ye been able;nay! not  yet  even now, are ye able,

3. For ye are yet fleshly. For, whereas there are, among you, jealousy and strife, are ye not, fleshly, and, after the manner of men, walking?

4. For, as soon as one beginneth to sayI, indeed, am of Paul! and anotherI, of Apollos! are ye not, men?

5. What then is Apollos? and, what is Paul? ministers through whom ye believed, and, each, as the Lord, gave to him.

6. I, planted, Apollos, watered,but, God, caused to, grow.

7. So that,   is he that planteth anything, nor, he that watereth,but, God, who causeth to, grow.

8. Moreover, he that planteth and he that watereth, are one:howbeit, each one, his own reward, shall receive,according to his own labour.

9. For we are, Gods, fellow-workmen: ye are, Gods, farm, Gods building.

10. According to the favour of God which hath been given unto me, as a wise master-builder, I laid a foundation, whereas, another, is building thereon; but, let each one, see, how he buildeth thereon;

11. For, other foundation, can, no one, lay, than that which is lying, which is, Jesus Christ.

12. But, if anyone is building, upon the foundationgold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,

13. Each ones work, shall be made, manifest; for, the day, will make it plain, because, by fire, is it to be revealed,and, each ones work, of what sort it is, the fire itself will prove:

14. If, anyones work, shall abide, which he built, a reward, shall he receive,

15. If, anyones work, shall be burnt up, he shall suffer loss, but shall, himself, be savedthough, thus, as through fire.

16. Know ye not that ye are a shrine a of God, and that the Spirit of God within you doth dwell?

17. If anyone doth mar the shrine of God, God, will mar him; for the shrine of God is holy,and such are ye.

18. Let no one be deceiving himself:if anyone imagineth himself to be wise among you, in this age, let him become foolish, that he may become wise;

19. For, the wisdom of this world, is, foolishness with God; for it is writtenHe that taketh the wise in their knavery,

20. And againThe Lord taketh note of the speculations of the wise, that they are vain.

21. So then, let, no one, be boasting in men; for, all things, are yours

22. Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come, all, are, yours,

23. And, ye, are Christs,and, Christ, is, Gods.

## 1 Corinthians 4

1. Let a man, so, be reckoning of us, as officers of Christ, and stewards of sacred secrets of God.

2. Here, furthermore, it is sought in stewards, that, faithful, one be found.

3. With me, however, it counteth for the very smallest thing, that, by you, I should be examined, or by a human day. Nay! I am not even examining myself,

4. For, of nothing, to myself, am I conscious: nevertheless, not hereby, am I declared righteous, but, he that doth examine me, is the Lord.

5. So then, not before the fitting time, be judging anything,until the Lord shall come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and, then, the praise shall come to each one, from God.

6. But, these things, brethren, have I transferred unto myself and Apollos, for your sakes, that, in us, ye might learn

7. For who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou which thou didst not receive? But, if thou didst even receive it, why dost thou boast, as though thou hadst not received it?

8. Already, ye have become full, already, ye are become rich,apart from us, ye are become kings! And I would indeed ye had become kings, that, we also, with you, might have together become kings!

9. For I think that, God, hath set forth, us the apostles, to be last of all, as men devoted to death,in that, a spectacle, have we been made, unto the world,both unto messengers and unto men.

10. We, are foolish for Christs sake, but, ye, prudent in Christ; we are weak, but, ye, mighty; ye, all-glorious, but, we, dishonoured.

11. Until the present hour, we both hunger and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and are wanderers,

12. And toil, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless, being persecuted, we hold on,

13. Being defamed, we beseech: as the sweepings of the world have we become, the offscouring of alluntil even now.

14. Not, to shame you, write I these things; but, as my beloved children, I admonish you.

15. For, though myriads of tutors ye should have in Christ, yet not many fathers; for, in Christ Jesus, through means of the joyful message, I, begat you.

16. I beseech you, therefore,become imitators of me.

17. For this cause, sent I unto you, Timothy,who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put, you, in mind of my ways which are in Christ  Jesus , even as, everywhere, in every assembly, I teach.

18. But, as though I were not coming unto you, some are puffed up!

19. Howbeit, I will come quickly unto you,if, the Lord, please,and will get to knownot the speech of them who are puffed up, but, the power;

20. For, not in speech, is the kingdom of God, but, in power.

21. What will ye? that, with a rod, I should come unto you? or, with love, and a spirit of meekness?

## 1 Corinthians 5

1. On all hands, there is reported to be among youfornication, and such fornication as thiswhich, not among the nations,   ,as that one should have, his fathers wife:

2. And, ye, have become puffed up, and have not rather mourned, in order that he might be removed out of your midst, who, this deed, hath wrought.

3. For, I, indeed,being absent in the body, but present in the spirit, have already judged, as present, him who, thus, this thing hath perpetrated:

4. In the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,

5. To deliver such a one as this, unto Satan, for the destruction of the flesh,that, the spirit, may be saved in the day of the Lord.

6. Unseemly, is your boast! Know ye not that, a little leaven, doth leaven, the whole of the lump?

7. Purge ye out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump,even as ye are unleavened; for, our passover, hath even been sacrificedChrist:

8. So then, let us be keeping the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of baseness and wickedness,but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

9. I wrote a unto you in my letternot to be mixing yourselves up with fornicators;

10. Not at all,   the fornicators of this world, or the covetous and extortioners, or idolaters,else had ye been obliged, in that case, to go out of the world!

11. But, now, I have written unto you not to be mixing yourselves up,if anyone named a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with such a one as this, not so much, as to be eating together,

12. For what have I to do to be judging them who are without? Do, ye, not judge, them who are within,

13. Whereas, them who are without, God, judgeth? Remove ye the wicked man from among, yourselves.

## 1 Corinthians 6

1. Dare any of you, having, a matter against his brother, sue for judgment before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?

2. Or know ye not that, the saints, shall judge the world? And, if, by you, the world, is to be judged, unworthy are ye of the smallest judgment-seats?

3. Know ye not that we shall judge, messengers? and not, then, matters of this life?

4. If, then, for matters of this, life ye have judgment-seats, them who are of no account in the assembly, these, are ye seating thereupon?

5. With a view to shame you, am I speaking. So, is it possible that there is among younot so much as one wise man, who shall be able to judge between his brethren,

6. But, brother with brother, sueth for judgment, and that before unbelievers?

7. Already, indeed, it is an utter defeat for you, that ye are having, law-suits, one with another. Wherefore are ye not rather taking wrong? Wherefore are ye not rather suffering yourselves to be defrauded?

8. Nay! but, ye, are doing wrong, and defrauding,and that

9. Or know ye not that, wrong-doers, shall not inherit, Gods kingdom? Be not deceiving yourselves:neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor sodomites,

10. Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortionersshall inherit, Gods kingdom.

11. And, these things, were some of you; but ye bathed them away,but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified, in the name of  our  Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.

12. All things, unto me, are allowable, but, not all things, are profitable: all things, unto me, are allowable, but, I, will not be brought under authority by any.

13. Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods; but, God, will set aside, both it and them. The body, however, is not for fornication, but, for the Lord,and, the Lord, for the body.

14. God, moreover, hath both raised up, the Lord, and will raise, us, up from among   through his power.

15. Know ye not that, your bodies, are, members of Christ? Shall I, then, take away the members of the Christ and make them members of a harlot? Far be it!

16. Or know ye not that, he that joineth himself unto the harlot, is, one body? For, saith he, the two, shall become, one flesh;

17. But, he that joineth himself unto the Lord, is, one Spirit.

18. Flee fornication! Every sin, whatsoever a man shall commit, is, outside his body, but, he that committeth fornication, bringeth sin into his own body.

19. Or know ye not that, your body, is, a shrine of the Holy Spirit that is within you, which ye have from God? And ye are not your own;

20. For ye have been bought with a price! Therefore glorify God in your body.

## 1 Corinthians 7

1. Now, concerning the things whereof ye wrote, it were, good, for a man, not to touch, a woman;

2. But, on account of fornications, let, each man, have, his own wife, and, each woman, have, her own husband:

3. Unto the wife, let the husband render what is her due, and, in like manner, the wife also, unto the husband,

4. The wife, over her own body, hath not authority, but the husband, and, in like manner, the husband also, over his own body, hath not authority, but the wife.

5. Be not depriving one anotherunless perhaps by consent for a season, that ye may have leisure for prayer, and, again, may be together,lest Satan be tempting you by reason of your want of self-control.

6. This, however I am saying, by way of concession, not of injunction;

7. Besides, I desire all men to be, even as myself,but, each one, hath his, personal, gift from God, one, after this manner, and, another, after that.

8. But I say, to the unmarried, and to the widows, good, were it for them, that they should abide, even as I;

9. But, if they have not self-control, let them marry, for, better, is it, to marry than to burn.

10. To the married, however, I give chargenot, I, but the Lord,that, a wife, from her husband, do not depart,

11. But, if she should even depart, let her remain unmarried, or, to her husband, be reconciled; and let not, a husband, leave, his wife.

12. But, unto the rest, say, Inot the Lord,if, any brother, hath, a wife that believeth not, and, she, is well pleased to dwell with him, let him not leave her;

13. And, a woman who hath a husband that believeth not, and, he, is well pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband;

14. For the husband that believeth not is hallowed in the wife, and the wife that believeth not is hallowed in the brother: else were, your children, impure, but, now, are they, pure.

15. But, if, the unbelieving, departeth, let him depart: the brother or the sister hath not come into bondage, in such cases, but, in peace, hath God called us.

16. For how knowest thou, O woman, whether, thy husband, thou shalt save? Or how knowest thou, O man, whether, thy wife, thou shalt save?

17. If notas the Lord hath distributedunto each one, as God hath called, each one, so, let him be walking;and, so, in all the assemblies, I ordain.

18. After being circumcised, was any called? let him not become uncircumcised; in uncircumcision, hath any been called? let him not be circumcised:

19. The circumcision, is, nothing, and, the uncircumcision, is, nothing,but keeping the commandments of God.

20. Each one, in the calling wherein he was called, in the same, let him abide:

21. A bond-servant, wast thou called? let it not cause thee concern; but, if thou canst even become, free, rather use it.

22. For, he who in the Lord was called, being a bond-servant, is, a freed-man of the Lord: in like manner, he that was called being, a freeman, is Christs bond-servant:

23. With a price, have ye been bought,do not become bond-servants of men:

24. Each one, wherein he was called, brethren, in the same, let him abide with God.

25. But, concerning them who are virgin, injunction of the Lord, have I none; yet, a judgment, do I give, as one who hath obtained mercy from the Lord to be, faithful:

26. I consider this, then, to be, good, in the circumstances, by reason of the existing distress,that it is, good for a man, so, to be:

27. Hast thou become bound to a wife? do not seek to be loosed; hast thou become loosed from a wife? do not seek a wife.

28. If, however, thou shouldst even marry, thou hast not sinned; and, if one who is virgin should marry, that one hath not sinned;but, tribulation of the flesh, shall, such, have:howbeit, I, spare you.

29. But, this, I saythe opportunity is, contracted for what remainethin order that, they who have wives, may be, as though they had none,

30. And, they who weep, as though they wept not, and, they who rejoice, as though they rejoiced not, and, they who buy, as though they possessed not,

31. And, they who use the world, as though they used it not to the full,for the fashion of this world passeth away;

32. And I desire you to be, without anxiety:the unmarried man, is anxious for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;

33. But, he that hath married, is anxious for the things of the world, how may please his wife

34. And he is divided; and, the unmarried woman, or the virgin, is anxious for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy  both  in her body and in her spirit; but, she that hath married, is anxious for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.

35. This, however, with a view to your own profit, am I saying,not that, a snare, upon you, I may cast, but with a view to what is comely, and devoted unto the Lord, without distraction.

36. If however anyone considereth it behaving unseemly towards his virginity, if he should be beyond the bloom of life,and, thus, it ought to come about, what he chooseth, let him do,he sinneth not: let them marry:

37. But, he that standeth in his heart, steadfast, having no necessity, but hath authority concerning his own will, and, this, hath determined in his own heart,to preserve his own virginity, well shall he do.

38. So that, he that giveth in marriage his own virginity, doeth, well; and, he that giveth it not, shall do, better.

39. A wife, is bound for as long a time as her husband is living; but, if the husband have fallen asleep, she is, free, to be married unto whom she pleaseth,only, in the Lord;

40. But, happier, is she, if, so, she remain,in my judgment; for I think, I also, have the Spirit of God.

## 1 Corinthians 8

1. Now, concerning the idol-sacrifices, we are awarebecause we, all, have knowledge,knowledge, puffeth up, but, love, buildeth up;

2. If anyone thinketh that he knoweth anything, not yet knoweth he, as he must needs come to know,

3. But, if anyone loveth God, the same, is known of him

4. Concerning, then, the eating of idol-sacrifices, we are awarethat an idol is, nothing, in the world, and that, none, is God save one.

5. For, if indeed there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or upon earth,as indeed there are gods many and lords many,

6.  Yet , to us, there is one God the Father, of whom are all things, and, we, for him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and, we, through him.

7. Howbeit, not in all, is the knowledge; but, some, by their familiarity, until even now, with the idol, as an idol-sacrifice, eat it, and, their conscience, being, weak, is defiled.

8. Food, indeed, will not commend us unto God,neither, if we eat not, do we lack, nor, if we eat, do we abound.

9. But be taking heed, lest, by any means, your right, itself, become, an occasion of stumbling, unto the weak;

10. For, if anyone should see  thee  who hast knowledge, in an idol-temple, reclining, will not, his conscience, being, weak, be built up for the eating of the idol-sacrifices?

11. In fact, he that is weak, is being destroyed, by thy knowledgethe brother for whose sake Christ died.

12. But, in thus sinning against the brethren am wounding their conscience, seeing it is weak, against Christ, are ye sinning.

13. Therefore, if food is an occasion of stumbling unto my brother, in nowise will I eat flesh unto the age that abideth,that, I may not occasion, my brother, to stumble.

## 1 Corinthians 9

1. Am not free? Am I not an apostle? Jesus our Lord, have I not seen? Are not, ye, my work, in the Lord?

2. If, unto others, I am not an apostle, certainly at least, unto you, I am; for, the seal of my apostleship, ye, are in the Lord.

3. My defence, unto them who are examining me, is this:

4. Have we not a right to eat and drink?

5. Have we not a right to take round, a sister wife,as even the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?

6. Or have, only I and Barnabas, not a right to forbear working?

7. Who serveth as a soldier, at his own charges, at any time? Who planteth a vineyard,and, the fruit thereof, doth not eat?  Or  who shepherdeth a flock,and, of the milk of the flock, doth not eat?

8. Is it, after the manner of men, that these things I am saying? Or doth not, even the law, the same things, say?

9. For, in the law of Moses, it is writtenThou shalt not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the corn:Is it, for the oxen, God is caring?

10. Or, for our sakes altogether, is he saying it? For our sakes, it was written; because, he that ploweth, ought, to plow, in hope,and, he that thresheth,   in hope of partaking.

11. If, we, unto you, the things of the Spirit have sown, is it a great matter, if, we, of you, the things of the flesh shall reap?

12. If, others, of this right, over you, are partaking,   things, do we conceal,lest we should cause any hindrance unto the glad message of the Christ.

13. Know ye not that, they who labour in the holy rites, do eat the provisions out of the holy place? They who at the altar wait, do, with the altar, share?

14. Thus, also, hath the Lord, appointedthat, they who the glad message tell, should, of the glad-message, live.

15. I, however, have not used any of these things; and have not written these things, in order that, so it should be done, in my case; for it were, good for me, rather to die thanmy boast, shall, no man, make void!

16. For, if I be telling the glad-message, it is, with me, no matter of boasting; for, necessity, upon me, lieth,for it is, Woe to me, if I should not be telling the glad-message;

17. For, if, by choice, this thing I am doing, I have, a reward; but, if not by choice, with a stewardship, have I been entrusted!

18. What, then, is my reward? that, in telling the glad-message, free of cost, I should put the glad-message,to the end I should not use to the full my right in the glad-message.

19. For, though free from all, unto all, myself, I enslaved,that, the larger number, I might win:

20. Therefore became I, to the Jews, as, a Jew,that, Jews, I might win; to them who were under law, as, under law, not being, myself, under law,that, them who were under law, I might win;

21. To them who were without law, as, without law,not being without law to God, but lawfully subject to Christ,that I might win them who were without law.

22. I became, unto the weak, weak,that, the weak, I might win;to all men, have I become all things, that, by all means, some, I might save.

23. But, all things, am I doing, for the sake of the glad-message, that a joint-partaker thereof, I may become.

24. Know ye not that, they who, in a racecourse, run, all, indeed, run,but, one, receiveth the prize? So, be running, that ye may lay hold.

25. But, every man who striveth in the games, in all things, useth self-control;they, indeed, then, that a corruptible crown, they may receive; but, we, an incorruptible!

26. I, therefore, so, am running, as, not uncertainly, so, am boxing, as not thrashing air;

27. But am beating my body under, and leading it captive, lest, by any means,unto others, having proclaimed,

## 1 Corinthians 10

1. For I wish not ye should be ignorant, brethren, that, all our fathers, were, under the cloud, and, all, passed through the sea,

2. And, all, immersed themselves into Moses, in the cloud, and in the sea;

3. And, all, did eat  the same  spiritual food,

4. And, all, drank, the same spiritual drink,for they continued to drink of the spiritual rock that followed them, and, the rock, was the Christ:

5. Nevertheless, with the most of them, God, was not well-pleased, for they were strewed along in the desert.

6. But, in these things, they became, ensamples for us, to the end we should not be covetous of evil things, even as, they, also coveted;

7. Neither become ye, idolaters, as some of them,as it is writtenThe people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to be making sport;

8. Neither let us commit fornication, as, some of them, committed fornication, and there fell, in one day, three and twenty thousand;

9. Neither let us be putting the Lord to the test, as, some of them, put him to the test, and, by the serpents, were perishing;

10. Neither be ye murmuring, even, as some of them, murmured, and perished by the destroyer.

11. But, these things, by way of type, were happening unto them, and were written with a view to our admonition, unto whom, the ends of the ages, have reached along.

12. So that, he that thinketh he is standing, let him take heed lest he fall.

13. Trial, hath not taken you, save such as man can bear; faithful, moreover is God, who will not suffer you to be tried above what ye are able, but will make, with the trial, also the way of escape, that ye may be able to hold out.

14. Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry,

15. As, to prudent men, I speak,judge, ye, what I say:

16. The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not, a sharing together of the blood of the Christ? The loaf which we break, is it not, a sharing together of the body of the Christ?

17. Because, one loaf, one body, we, the many, are, for we, all, of the one loaf, partake.

18. Be looking at Israel after the flesh:are not, they who eat the sacrifices, joint partakers with the altar?

19. What, then, am I saying?that, an idol-sacrifice, is anything? or that, an idol, is anything?

20. On the contrarythat, the things which the nations sacrifice, unto demons, and not unto God, they sacrifice; and I wish not that ye should become, sharers together with the demons!

21. Ye cannot be drinkinga cup of the Lord, and a cup of demons; ye cannot be partaking of, a table of the Lord, and a table of demons.

22. Or are we to provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we mightier than he?

23. All things are allowablebut, not all things, are profitable,all things are allowablebut, not all things, upbuild.

24. Let, no one, be seeking, what concerneth himself, but that which concerneth some one else.

25. Whatsoever, in the market, is sold, eat,asking no question, for conscience sake;

26. For, unto the Lord, belongeth the earth, and the fullness thereof.

27. If one of them who believe not invite you, and ye are disposed to go, whatsoever is set before you, eat,asking no question, for conscience sake.

28. But, if anyone should say unto you,This, is, a holy sacrifice, do not eat, for that mans sake who disclosed it, and for conscience sake:

29. But, conscience, I mean, not thine own, but the others,for why is my freedom to be judged by anothers conscience?

30. If, I, with gratitude, partake, why am I to be defamed, as to that for which, I, give thanks?

31. Whether, therefore, ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do, all things to the glory of God.

32. Give no occasion of stumblingwhether to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the assembly of God:

33. Even as, I also, in all things do please all, not seeking my own profit, but that of the many, that they may be saved.

## 1 Corinthians 11

1. Become imitators of me,even as, I also,   of Christ.

2. Now I praise you, that, in all things, ye have me in remembrance, and, even as I delivered unto you the instructions, ye hold them fast.

3. But I wish you to knowthat, the head of every man, is, the Christ, and, the head of a woman, is, the man; and, the head of the Christ, is, God.

4. Every man, praying, or prophesying, having anything upon his head, putteth to shame his head;

5. But, every woman, praying, or prophesying, with her head, unveiled, putteth to shame her head,for it is, one and the same, with her having been shaven.

6. For, if a woman doth not veil herself, let her also be shorn; but, if it were a shame in a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled.

7. For, a man, indeed, ought not to be veiling his head, being, the image and glory of God,but, the woman, is the glory of man;

8. For, man, is not, of woman, but, woman, of man;

9. For also man was not created, for the sake of the woman, but woman, for the sake of the man.

10. For this cause, ought the woman to have, permission, upon her head, because of the messengers.

11. Howbeit, neither is woman apart from man, nor man apart from womanin the Lord;

12. For, just as the woman is of the man, so, also the man, is through means of the woman;but, all things, are of God.

13. Among your own selves, judge ye,Is it becoming for a woman,unveiled, to be praying unto God?

14. Doth not, even nature herself, teach youthat, if, a man, have long hair, it is a dishonour to him;

15. But, if, a woman, have long hair, it is a glory to her, for, her long hair, instead of a veil, hath been given to her.

16. But, if anyone thinketh to be contentious, we, have no such custom,nor yet the assemblies of God.

17. But, in giving you the following charge, I praise you not,in that, not for the better, but for the worse, ye come together.

18. For, first of all,when ye come together in assembly, I hear that divisions among you exist,and, in part, I believe it;

19. For there must needs be, even parties among you, that, the approved,  themselves  may become manifest among you.

20. When, therefore, ye come together into one place, it is not to eat, a supper unto the Lord;

21. For, each one, taketh beforehand, his own supper, in your eating, and, one, indeed, is hungry, whereas, another, is drinking to excess.

22. What! have ye not houses for your eating and drinking? or, the assembly of God, do ye despise, and, put to shame them who have nothing? What am I to say to you? Shall I praise you? In this, I praise you not.

23. For, I myself, received from the Lordthat which I also delivered unto you,how that, the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was being delivered up, took a loaf,

24. And, giving thanks, brake it, and saidThis, is my body, which is for you,this, do ye, in remembrance of me;

25. In the same manner, the cup also, after they had taken supper, sayingThis cup, is, the new covenant in my blood, this, do ye, as often soever as ye may be drinking it, in remembrance of me.

26. For, as often as ye may be eating this loaf, and, the cup, may be drinking, The death of the Lord, do ye announce, until he come.

27. So that, whosoever may be eating the loaf, or drinking the cup of the Lord, in an unworthy manner, shall be responsible for the body and blood of the Lord.

28. But let a man be proving himself,and, so, of the loaf, let him eat, and, of the cup, let him drink;

29. For, he that is eating and drinking,judgment unto himself, doth eat and drink,if he be not setting apart the body.

30. For this cause, many among you are weak and sickly; and, not a few, are falling asleep.

31. If, however, we had been setting, ourselves, apart, we had not, in that case, been coming under judgment;

32. But, being brought under judgment, by the Lord, are we being disciplined, lest, with the world, we should be condemned.

33. So then, my brethren,when ye come together for the eating, unto one another, be giving welcome:

34. If anyone be hungry, at home, let him eat, lest, unto judgment, ye be coming together. And, the remaining things, whensoever I come, I will set in order.

## 1 Corinthians 12

1. But, concerning the spiritually gifted, brethren, I am not wishing you to be ignorant.

2. Ye know that, when ye were of the nations, unto the dumb idols, howsoever ye were being led, ye were seduced.

3. Wherefore, I give you to knowthat, no one, in Gods Spirit speaking, saithAccursed Jesus! and, no one, can sayLord Jesus! save in   Holy Spirit.

4. But, distributions of gifts, there are, yet the same Spirit,

5. And, distributions of ministries, there are, and the same Lord,

6. And, distributions of energies, there are, and the same Godwho energiseth all things in all.

7. But, unto each one, is given the manifesting of the Spirit, with a view to that which is profitable;

8. For, unto one, indeed, through the Spirit, is given, a word of wisdom, but, unto another, a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;

9. Unto a different one, faith, in the same Spirit, and, unto another, gifts of healings, in the one Spirit,

10. And, unto another, energies of mighty works,  and , unto another, prophesying,  and , unto another, discriminations of spirits,unto a different one, kinds of tongues, and, unto another, translation of tongues;

11. But, all these, energiseth the one and the same Spirit, distributing unto each one, peculiarly, even as it is disposed.

12. For, just as, the body, is one, and yet hath many members, but, all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so, also, the Christ;

13. For, even to one Spirit, we all, into one body, have been immersed,whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free,and, all, of one Spirit, have been caused to drink.

14. For, the body also, is not one member, but many:

15. Though the foot should sayBecause I am not a hand, I am not of the body, Is it, therefore, not, of the body?

16. And, though the ear should sayBecause I am not an eye, I am not of the body, Is it, therefore, not, of the body?

17. If, the whole body, were, an eye, where were the hearing? If, the whole were, hearing, where were, the smelling?

18. But, now, hath God set the members, each one of them in the body, even as he pleased.

19. But, if they all had been one member, Where had been, the body?

20. Now, however there are many members, yet one body;

21.  And  the eye cannot say unto the handI have no need of thee,nor, again, the head, unto the feetI have no need of you:

22. Nay! much more, the members which seem to be weaker are necessary,

23. And, the parts of the body which we deem to be less honourable, on these, more abundant honour, do we bestow, and, our uncomely parts, have, more abundant comeliness,

24. Whereas, our comely parts, have, no need. But, God, hath tempered the body together,unto that which was lacking, giving more abundant honour;

25. That there might be no division in the body, but that the members might have, the same, care, one for another;

26. And, whether one member, suffereth, all the members, suffer with it, or, a member is glorified, all the members, rejoice together.

27. Now, ye, are the body of Christ, and members severally;

28. And God hath, indeed, set, certain, in the assembly,first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that mighty works, then gifts of healings, helps, guidings, kinds of tongues.

29. Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all mighty works?

30. Have, all, gifts of healings? Do, all, with tongues, speak? Do, all, translate?

31. Be envious, however, of the greater gifts; and, yet, a much more excellent way, unto you, I point out:

## 1 Corinthians 13

1. Although with the tongues of men, I be speaking, and of messengers, and have not, love, I have become resounding brass, or a clanging cymbal;

2. And, though I have   prophesying, and know all sacred secrets, and all knowledge,and though I have all faith, so as to be removing mountains, and have not, love, I am, nothing;

3. And, though I morsel out all my goods,and though I deliver up my body, that I may boast, and have not, love, I am profited, nothing.

4. Love, is patient, is gracious. Love, is not envious, vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,

5. Acteth not unbecomingly, seeketh not her own things, is not easily provoked, imputeth not that which is base,

6. Rejoiceth not over unrighteousness, but rejoiceth in sympathy with truth,

7. All things, covereth, all things, believeth, all things, hopeth, all things, endureth.

8. Love, at no time, faileth;but, whether prophesyings, they shall be done away, whether tongues, they shall cease, whether gaining knowledge, it shall be done away;

9. For, in part, are we gaining knowledge, and, in part, are we prophesying,

10. But, as soon as that which is complete is come, that which is in part, shall be done away.

11. When I was a child, I used to speak as a child, to prefer as child, to reason as a child: now I have become a man, I have laid aside the things of the child!

12. For we see, as yet, through a dim window, obscurely, but, then, face to face: as yet, I gain knowledge, in part, but, then, shall I fully know, even as I was also fully known.

13. But, now abidefaith, hope, love,these three; but, the greatest of these, is, love.

## 1 Corinthians 14

1. Pursue love; nevertheless be envious of the spiritual gifts,and, rather, that ye may be prophesying.

2. For, he that speaketh with a tongue, not unto men, doth speak, but, unto God,for, no one, understandeth, although, in spirit, he is speaking sacred secrets;

3. But, be that prophesieth, unto men, doth speakedification, and exhortation, and comfort.

4. He that speaketh with a tongue, buildeth up, himself, whereas, he that prophesieth, buildeth up, an assembly.

5. Howbeit I wish you all to speak with tongues, but, rather, that ye may prophesy,moreover, greater, is he that prophesieth, than he that speaketh with tongues,unless indeed he translate, that, the assembly, may receive upbuilding.

6. But, now, brethrenif I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit, you, except I speak, unto you, either by way of revelation, or knowledge, or prophesying, or teaching?

7. In like manner, the things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, if, a distinction in the sounds, they do not give, how shall it be known, what is being piped or harped?

8. For, if also, an uncertain sound, a trumpet, should give, who shall prepare himself for battle?

9. So, also, ye, through means of the tongue, except ye give intelligible discourse, how shall it be known what is being spoken? for ye will be speaking, to the air.

10. There may happen to be so many kinds of languages in the world, and, not one, unspoken:

11. If, then, I do not know the meaning of the language, I shall be, unto him that is speaking, a foreigner, and, he that is speaking, shall be, in my case, a foreigner.

12. So, ye, alsosince ye are, envious, of spirits, unto the upbuilding of the assembly, seek to be pre-eminent.

13. Wherefore, he that speaketh with a tongue, let him pray that he may translate;

14.  For , if I am praying in a tongue, my spirit, is praying, but, my mind, is unfruitful.

15. What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, but I will pray also with the mind,I will strike the strings with the spirit,  but  I will strike the strings also with the mind.

16. Else, if thou be blessing in a spirit, he that filleth up the place of the ungifted person, how shall he say the Amen upon thy thanksgiving? since indeed, what thou art saying, he knoweth not;

17. For, thou, indeed, excellently art giving thanks, but, the other, is not being built up.

18. I give thanks unto God!More than ye all, am I speaking with tongues;

19. But, in assembly, I desire to speak five words with my mind, that, others also, I may instruct, than myriads of words in a tongue.

20. Brethren! do not become children, in your understandings; but, in baseness, become babes, while, in your understandings, ye become, full-grown.

21. In the law, it is writtenWith strange tongues, and with lips of strangers, will I speak unto this people; and, not even so, will they hearken unto me,saith the Lord.

22. So that, the tongues, are for a signnot unto them that believe, but, unto them that believe not; whereas, prophesying, is not for them that believe not, but, for them that believe.

23. If, then, the whole assembly come together with one consent, and, all, are speaking with tongues,and there come in persons unskilled or unbelieving, will they not say that ye are raving?

24. But, if, all, be prophesying,and there come in one who is unbelieving or unskilled, he is convicted by all, he is searched by all, the secrets of his heart, become manifest,

25. And, so, falling down upon his face, he will do homage unto God, reporting that, in reality, God is, among you.

26. What, then, is it, brethren? Whensoever ye are coming together, each one, hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath a translation:let, all things, be done, unto building up.

27. If, with a tongue, one is speaking, let it be by two, or, at the most, three,and by turns; and let, one, be translating;

28. But, if there be none to translate, let him keep silence in assembly, and, unto himself, be speaking, and, unto God!

29. Prophets, moreover, let two or three speak, and let, the others, judge.

30. If, however, unto another, a revelation be made, as he is sitting, let the first be silent;

31. For, one by one, ye can, all, be prophesying,that, all, may learn, and, all, be encouraged.

32. And, spirits of prophets, unto prophets, do submit themselves;

33. For God is not

34. As for the women, in the assemblies, let them be silent, for it is not permitted them to be speaking; but let them be in submission,even as, the law, saith.

35. If, however, they are wishing to learn something, at home, their own husbands, let them question; for it is a shame for a woman to be speaking in assembly.

36. Or, from you, did the word of God come forth? Or, unto you alone, did it extend?

37. If anyone thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritually gifted, let him acknowledge the things which I am writing to you,that they are, a commandment, of the Lord.

38. But, if anyone knoweth not, he is unknown!

39. So, then, my brethren,be zealous to prophesy, and do not forbid, to be speaking with tongues;

40. But let, all things, with comeliness, and by arrangement, be done.

## 1 Corinthians 15

1. Moreover, brethren, I make known unto you The joyful message, which I myself announced to you, which also ye received, in which also ye stand;

2. Through which also ye are being saved,if ye hold fast, with what discourse, I announced the joyful message unto you; unless indeed, in vain, ye believed.

3. For I delivered unto you, among the first things, what also I received:how that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures,

4. And that he was buried, and that he hath been raised, on the third day, according to the Scriptures,

5. And that he appeared unto Cephas, then, to the twelve,

6. After that, he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once,of whom, the greater number, remain until even now, but, some, have fallen asleep,

7. After that, he appeared unto James, then, unto all the apostles,

8. And, last of all, just as if unto the unseasonable birth, he appeared, even unto me;

9. For, I, am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the assembly of God.

10. But, by favour of God, I am what I am, and, his favour, which was unto me, hath not been made void,but, much more abundantly than they all, have I toiled, albeit not, I, but the favour of God with me.

11. Whether therefore, I, or, they, thus do we proclaim, and, thus did ye believe.

12. Now, if, Christ is proclaimed, that, from among the dead, he hath been raised, how say some, among youresurrection of the dead, there is none?

13. But, if, resurrection of the dead, there is none, not even Christ, hath been raised;

14. And, if Christ, hath not been raised, void, after all, is our proclamation, void also, our faith,

15. And we are found, even false-witnesses of God, because we have witnessed respecting God, that he raised the Christ,whom he did not raise, if, indeed, after all, the dead are not raised!

16. For, if the dead are not raised, not even Christ, hath been raised;

17. And, if Christ hath not been raised, to no purpose, is your faith, yet, are ye in your sins!

18. Hence also, they who are fallen asleep in Christ, are lost:

19. If, in this life, in Christ, we have hopedand that is all, we are, of all men, most to be pitied.

20. But, now, hath Christ been raised from among the dead,a firstfruit of them who have fallen asleep;

21. For, since indeed, through a man, came death, through a man, also cometh the raising of the dead;

22. For, just as, in the Adam, all die, so, also, in the Christ, shall all be made alive.

23. But, each, in his own rank:A firstfruit, Christ, after that, they who are the Christs, in his presence,

24. Afterwards, the endwhensoever he delivereth up the kingdom unto his God and Father, whensoever he shall bring to nought all rule and all authority and power;

25. For he must needs reign, until he shall put all his enemies under his feet:

26. As a last enemy, death, is to be destroyed;

27. ForHe put, all things, in subjection under his feet. But, whensoever it shall be saidall things are in subjection!it is evident that it means,Except him who did put into subjection, unto him, the all things

28. But whensoever have been put into subjection, unto him, the all things, then, the Son himself,  also  shall be put in subjection unto him who put in subjection, unto him, the all things,that, God, may be, all things in all.

29. Else, what will they do, who are being immersed in behalf of the dead? If, not at all, are the dead to be raised, why are they even being immersed in their behalf?

30. Why also are, we, running into peril every hour?

31. Day by day, am I dying!Yea! by your own boasting, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.

32. If, after the manner of men, I have fought with wild-beasts at Ephesus, what, to me, the profit? If the dead are not raised, Let us eat and drink, for, tomorrow, we die.

33. Be not deceiving yourselves,evil communications corrupt gentle manners:

34. Wake up to sobriety, in righteousness, and be not committing sin; for some have, an ignorance of God: for shame, unto you, am I speaking!

35. But some one will sayHow, are the dead raised? and, with what kind of body, do they come?

36. Simple one! What, thou, sowest, is not quickened, except it die;

37. And, what thou sowest, not the body that shall come into existence, dost thou sow, but a naked kernelif it so happen, of wheat, or of any of the rest,

38. Howbeit, God, giveth it a body, as he pleased, and, unto each of the seeds, a body of its own.

39. Not all flesh, is the same flesh; but, one, indeed, is,   of men, and, another, the flesh of beasts, and, another, the flesh of birds, and, another, of fishes;

40. And there are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies,but, of one kind, indeed, is the glory of the heavenly, and, of another kind, is the glory of the earthly;

41. One, is the glory of a sun, and, another, the glory of a moon, and, another, the glory of stars,nay! star from star, differeth in glory.

42. Thus, also the resurrection of the dead: it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption,

43. It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory, it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power,

44. It is sown a body of the soul, it is raised a body of the spirit; if there is a body of the soul, there is also of the spirit:

45. Thus, also, it is writtenThe first man, Adam, became, a living soul, the last Adam, a life-giving spirit.

46. Howbeit, not first, is the   of the spirit, but that, of the soul,afterwards, that of the spirit.

47. The first man, is of the ground, earthy, the second man, is, of heaven:

48. As, the man of earth, such, also, the men of earth, and, as, the man of heaven, such, also, the men of heaven;

49. And, even as we have borne the image of the man of earth, let us also bear the image of the man of heaven.

50. And, this, I say, brethren,that, flesh and blood, cannot inherit, Gods kingdom. Neither doth, corruption, inherit, incorruption.

51. Lo! a sacred secret, unto you, do I declare:we shall not, all, sleep, but we shall, all, be changed,

52. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, during the last trumpet; for it shall sound, and, the dead, shall be raised, incorruptible, and, we, shall be changed.

53. For this corruptible must needs clothe itself with incorruptibility, and this mortal, clothe itself, with immortality.

54. But, whensoever, this mortal, shall clothe itself with immortality, then, shall be brought to pass the saying that is writtenDeath hath been swallowed up, victoriously;

55. Where, O death, is thy victory? Where, O death, is thy sting?

56. Now, the sting of death, is, sin, and, the power of sin, is, the law;

57. But, unto God, be thanks, who is giving unto us the victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ.

58. So, then, my beloved brethren,become ye, steadfast, immovable, superabounding in the work of the Lord, at all times; knowing that, your toil, is not in vain in the Lord.

## 1 Corinthians 16

1. Now, concerning the collection which is for the saints, just as I directed the assemblies of Galatia, so, also do, ye:

2. Upon the first of the week, let, each one of you, put, by itself, in store, as he may be prospering,lest, as soon as I come, then, collections, should be in progress.

3. And, as soon as I arrive, whomsoever ye shall approve by letters, these, will I send, to bear away your favour unto Jerusalem:

4. And, if it be meet that, I also, be journeying, with me, shall they journey.

5. Now I will come unto you, as soon as I have passed through Macedonia,for I do pass through Macedonia,

6. And, with you, I may perhaps sojourn, or winter, that, ye, may set me forward, whithersoever I may be journeying.

7. For I do not wish to see you, just now, by the way; for I hope to remain, some time, with you,if, the Lord, permit.

8. But I remain in Ephesus, until the Pentecost,

9. For, a door, unto me, hath opened, great and effectual, and, opposers, are many.

10. But, if Timothy should come, see that, without fear, he be with you, for, in the work of the Lord, doth he labour, even as, I:

11. Let no one then despise him; and set ye him forward in peace, that he may come unto me, for I expect him with the brethren.

12. But, concerning Apollos the brother, much, did I beseech him, that he would come unto you, with the brethren, but there was, by no means, any will, that he should come, now;he will come, however, as soon as he hath good opportunity.

13. Be on the watch, stand firm in the faith, be menbe strong;

14. Let, all your affairs, in love, be carried on.

15. Now I beseech you, brethren,ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is a first-fruit of Achaia, and, for the purpose of ministering, they devoted themselves, unto the saints

16. That, ye also, be submitting yourselves unto such as these,and unto everyone helping in the work and toiling.

17. I Rejoice, moreover, in the presence of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus: because, your own shortcoming, these, have filled up:

18. They have given rest, in fact, unto my spirit, and yours: hold in acknowledgment, therefore, such as these.

19. The assemblies of Asia salute you: Aquila and Priscilla, with the assembly meeting at their house, salute you much in the Lord:

20. All the brethren salute you:Salute ye one another with a holy kiss.

21. The salutation of Paulwith my own hand.

22. If anyone doth not dearly love the Lord, let him be anathema   .

23. The favour of the Lord Jesus, be with you.

24. My love, be with you all, in Christ Jesus.
