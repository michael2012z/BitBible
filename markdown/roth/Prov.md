## Proverbs 1

__To execute upon them the sentence written, An honour, shall it be to all his men of lovingkindness. Praise ye Yah!__

1. The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, King of Israel:

2. For the knowledge of wisdom and correction, for discerning the sayings of intelligence;

3. For receiving the correction of prudence, righteousness and justice, and equity;

4. For giving To the simple shrewdness, To the young man, knowledge and discretion.

5. A wise man, will hear, and will increase learning, and a, discreet man, wise counsels, will acquire,

6. By gaining discernment of proverb, and satire, the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.

7. The reverence of Yahweh, is the beginning of knowledge, Wisdom and correction, the foolish have despised.

8. Hear, my son, the correction of thy father, and do not reject the instruction of thy mother;

9. For, a wreath of beauty, shall they be to thy head, and chains of ornament, to thy neck.

10. My son, if sinners entice thee, do not consent.

11. If they sayCome with us,Let us lie in wait for blood, Let us watch in secret for him who is needlessly innocent;

12. Let us engulf them, like hades, alive, While in health, like them who are going down to the pit;

13. All costly substance, shall we find, We shall fill our houses with spoil;

14. Thy lot, shalt thou cast into our midst, One purse, shall there be, for us all.

15. My son, do not walk in the way with them, Withhold thy foot from their path.

16. For, their feet, to mischief, do run, and haste to the shedding of blood.

17. Surely, in vain, is spread the net, in the sight of aught that hath wings!

18. Yet, they, for their own blood, lie in wait, They watch in secret for their own life.

19. Such are the ways of every one that graspeth with greed, The life of the owners thereof, it taketh away!

20. Wisdom, in the open place, soundeth forth, in the broadways, she raiseth her voice;

21. At the head of bustling streets, she crieth aloud,at the openings of the gates in the cityher sayings, she doth utter:

22. How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and, scoffers, in scoffing, delight them? and, dullards, hate knowledge?

23. Will ye turn, at my reproof? Lo! I will pour out to you my spirit, I will make known my words to you.

24. Because I called, and ye refused, I stretched out my hand, and no one regarded;

25. But ye dismissed all my counsel, and, to my rebuke, would not yield,

26. I also, at your calamity, will laugh, I will mock, when cometh your dread;

27. When cometh as a crashing your dread, and, your calamity, as a storm-wind, overtaketh, when there come upon you, distress and anguish.

28. Then, will they call me, but I will not answer, they will seek me diligently, but shall not find me.

29. Because they hated knowledge, and, the reverence of Yahweh, did not choose;

30. Consented not to my counsel, disdained all my rebuke,

31. Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and, with their own counsels, be filled.

32. For, the turning away of the simple, will slay them,and, the carelessness of dullards, will destroy them.

33. Whereas, he that hearkeneth unto me, shall dwell safely, and be at rest, without dread of misfortune.

## Proverbs 2

1. My son, if thou wilt receive my sayings, and, my commandments, wilt treasure up by thee;

2. So that thou direct, unto wisdom, thine ear, bend thy heart, unto understanding;

3. Yea if, for understanding, thou cry aloud, for knowledge, utter thy voice;

4. If thou seek her as silver, and, like hid treasure, thou search for her,

5. Then, shalt thou understand the reverence of Yahweh, and, the knowledge of God, shalt thou find.

6. For, Yahweh, giveth wisdom, out of his mouth, knowledge and understanding;

7. Yea he treasureth, for the upright, safety, A shield   to them who walk in integrity,

8. To him that observeth the paths of justice, yea, the way of his men of lovingkindness, he doth guard.

9. Then, shalt thou understand righteousness and justice, and equityevery noble course.

10. When wisdom entereth thy heart, and, knowledge, to thy soul, is sweet,

11. Discretion, shall watch over thee, understanding, shall preserve thee:

12. To rescue thee from the way of the wrongful, from the man that speaketh perverse things;

13. From them who forsake the paths of rectitude, to walk in this ways of darkness;

14. Who rejoice to do wrong, exult in the perversities of the wrongful;

15. Whose paths, are twisted, and they are tortuous in their tracks:

16. To rescue thee, from the woman that is a stranger, from the female unknown, who with her speeches seduceth;

17. Who forsaketh the friend of her youth, and, the covenant of her God, hath forgotten;

18. For she hath appointed, unto death, her house, and unto the shades, her courses;

19. None who go in unto her, come back, neither attain they unto the paths of life:

20. To the end that thou walk in the way of good men, and, the paths of the righteous, that thou observe.

21. For, the upright, shall abide on the earth,and, the men of integrity, shall remain therein;

22. But, the lawless, out of the earth, shall he cut off, and, traitors, shall they tear away therefrom.

## Proverbs 3

2. For, length of days and years of life, and blessedness, shall they and to thee.

3. Lovingkindness and faithfulness, let them not forsake thee,bind them, upon thy neck, write them upon the tablet of thy heart:

4. So find thou favour and good repute, in the eyes of God and man.

5. Trust thou in Yahweh, with all thy heart, and, unto thine own understanding, do not lean:

6. In all thy ways, acknowledge him, and, he, will make straight thy paths.

7. Do not become wise in thine own eyes, revere Yahweh, and avoid evil:

8. Healing, shall it be to thy body, and refreshing, to thy bones.

9. Honour thou Yahweh, with thy substance, and with the firstfruit of all thine increase;

10. So shall thy storehouses be filled with plenty, and, with new wine, shall thy vats overflow.

11. The, chastening of Yahweh, my son, do not reject, nor loathe his rebuke;

12. For, whom Yahweh loveth, he correcteth, he causeth pain to the son in whom he delighteth.

13. How happy the man who hath found wisdom, and the man who draweth forth understanding,

14. For better is her merchandise, than the merchandise of silver, yea, than gold, her increase;

15. More precious, is she, than corals, yea, none of thy delightful things, doth equal her:

16. Length of days, is in her right hand, in her left, are riches and honour;

17. Her ways, are ways of pleasantness, and, all her paths, are peace;

18. A tree of life, is she, to them who secure her,and, they who hold her fast, are every one to be pronounced happy.

19. Yahweh, in wisdom, founded the earth, establishing the heavens with understanding;

20. By his knowledge, the resounding deeps were burst open, and, the skies, drop down dew.

21. My son, let them not depart from thine eyes, guard thou counsel, and purpose:

22. So shall they become life to thy soul, and an adorning to thy neck;

23. Then, shalt thou walk securely in thy way, and, thy foot, shall not stumble;

24. When thou sittest down, thou shalt have no dread, yea thou shalt lie down, and sweet shall be thy sleep.

25. Be not thou afraid of sudden dread, nor of the desolation of the lawless, when it cometh.

26. For, Yahweh, will be in all thy ways, and will keep thy foot from the snare.

27. Withhold not good from them who ask it, when it is in power of thy hand to do it:

28. Do not say to thy neighbour, Go and come again, and to-morrow I will give, when thou hast it by thee.

29. Devise not against thy neighbour an injury, seeing that, he, dwelleth securely by thee.

30. Contend not with a man without cause, if he hath dealt thee no wrong.

31. Do not thou envy the man of violence, neither choose thou any of his ways;

32. For, an abomination to Yahweh, is the tortuous man, but, with the upright, he is intimate.

33. The curse of Yahweh, is in the house of the lawless one, but, the home of the righteous, he blesseth.

34. Though at scoffers he scoffeth, yet, to the humbled, he granteth favour.

35. Honour, shall the wise inherit,but, as for dullards, shame shall carry them away.

## Proverbs 4

1. Hear, ye sons, the correction of a father, and attend, that ye may know understanding.

2. For, good teaching, have I given you, mine instruction, do not ye forsake.

3. For, a son, became I to my father, tender and most precious in the sight of my mother.

4. So he taught me, and said to meLet thy heart, lay hold of my words, Keep my commandments and live!

5. Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding, Do not forget, neither decline thou from the sayings of my mouth.

6. Do not forsake her, and she will guard thee,love her and she will keep thee.

8. Exalt her, and she will set thee on high, she will bring thee to honour, when thou dust embrace her:

9. She will give for thy head, a wreath of beauty, A crown of adorning, will she bestow upon thee.

10. Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, and they will multiply to thee the years of life.

11. In the way of wisdom, have I taught thee, I have guided thee in tracks of uprightness.

12. When thou walkest, thy step shall not be hemmed in, and, if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.

13. Take fast hold of correction, let her not go,keep her, for, she, is thy life.

14. Upon the path of the lawless, do not thou enter, and do not advance in the way of the wicked:

15. Avoid it, do not pass thereonturn from it, and depart.

16. For they sleep not, unless they can do mischief,They rob themselves of their sleep, if they cannot cause someone to stumble,

17. For they consume bread gotten by lawlessness, and, wine obtained by violence, they drink.

18. But, the path of the righteous, is as the light of dawn,going on and brightening, unto meridian day.

19. The way of the lawless, is like darkness, they know not, at what they stumble.

20. My son, to my words, attend, to my sayings, incline thou thine ear;

21. Let them not depart from thine eyes, keep them in the midst of thy heart;

22. For, life, they are, to them who find them,and, to every part of ones flesh, they bring healing.

27. Decline not, to the right hand or to the left,Turn away thy foot from wickedness.

## Proverbs 5

1. My son, to my wisdom, attend, and, to mine understanding, incline thou thine ear:

2. That thou mayest preserve discretion,and, as for knowledge, that thy lips may guard it.

3. For, with sweet droppings, drip the lips of her that is a stranger, and, smoother than oil, is her mouth;

4. But, the latter end of her, is bitter as wormwood, sharp, as a two-edged sword!

5. Her feet, are going down to death,on hades, will her steps take firm hold.

6. Lest, the path of life, she should ponder, her tracks have wandered she knoweth not   .

7. Now, therefore, ye sons, hearken unto me, and do not turn away from the sayings of my mouth.

8. Keep far from her thy way, and do not go near the opening of her house:

9. Lest thou give, to other men, thy vigour, and thy years, to him that is cruel:

10. Lest strange men, be well fed, by thy strength, and, thy toils, be in the house of the alien.

11. So shalt thou grieve in thy latter end, in the failing of thy flesh and of thy healthy condition;

12. And thou shalt sayHow I hated correction! and, reproof, my heart disdained;

13. Neither hearkened I to the voice of my teachers, nor, to my instructors, inclined I mine ear:

14. Soon was I in all evil, in the midst of convocation and assembly.

15. Drink thou water out of thine own cistern, and flowing streams out of the midst of thine own well.

16. Let not thy fountains, flow over, abroad, in the streets, dividings of waters:

17. Let them be for thyself, alone, and not for strangers with thee.

18. Let thy well-spring be blessed,and get thy joy from the wife of thy youth:

19. A loving hind! a graceful doe! let, her bosom, content thee at all times, and, in her love, mayst thou stray evermore.

20. Wherefore, then, shouldst thou stray, my son, with a strange woman? or embrace the bosom of a woman unknown?

21. For, before the eyes of Yahweh, are the ways of a man,and, all his tracks, doth he consider:

22. His own iniquities, shall entrap him with the lawless, and, by the cords of his own sin, shall he be seized.

23. He, shall die, for lack of discipline, and, by the abounding of his perversity, shall he be lost.

## Proverbs 6

1. My son, if thou have become surety for thy neighbour,have struck for a stranger thy hands,

2. Thou hast been snared by the sayings of thy mouth,thou hast been caught by the sayings of thy mouth.

3. Do this then, my son, and deliver thyself, When thou hast come into the hand of thy neighbour, Go, haste thee, and urge thy neighbour;

4. Do not give sleep to thine eyes, or slumber to thine eyelashes;

5. Deliver thyself, as a gazelle out of the hand, and as a bird, out of the hand of the fowler.

6. Go to the ant, thou sluggard, observe her ways, and be wise;

7. Which, having no harvest, scribe, or ruler,

8. Prepareth, in the summer, her food, hath collected, in the harvest, her sustenance.

9. How long, O sluggard, wilt thou lie? how long ere thou rise from thy sleep?

10. A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest:

11. So shall come in, as a highwayman, thy poverty, and, thy want, as one armed with a shield.

12. An abandoned man, a man of iniquity,   whogoeth on in perversity of mouth;

13. Winketh with his eyes, speaketh with his foot, pointeth with his fingers;

14. perverse things in his heart, deviseth mischief on every occasion, strifes, he sendeth forth.

15. For this cause, suddenly cometh his doom, in a moment, shall he be torn in pieces and there be no mending.

16. These six things, doth Yahweh hate, yea, seven, are the abomination of his soul:

17. Eyes that are lofty, a tongue that is false, and hands shedding innocent blood;

18. A heart contriving iniquitous devices, feet hasting to run into mischief;

19. One that uttereth liesa false witness, and one sending forth strifes between brethren.

20. Observe thou, my son, the commandment of thy father, and do not decline from the instruction of thy mother:

21. Bind them upon thy heart continually, fasten them upon thy neck;

22. When thou walkest abroad, it shall guide thee, when thou sleepest, it shall watch over thee, when thou wakest, it shall speak to thee:

23. For, a lamp, is the commandment, and, the instruction, a light, and, the way of life, are the reproofs of correction:

24. To keep thee from the wicked woman, from the flattery of the tongue of her that is a stranger.

25. Do not covet her beauty, in thy heart, neither let her take thee, by her eyelashes;

26. Because, for the sake of an impure woman,   even to a cake of bread,and, a mans wife, for a precious soul, may hunt!

27. Can a man snatch up fire in his bosom, and, his clothes, not be burned?

28. Or can a man walk upon hot coals, and, his feet, not be burned?

29. So, he that goeth in unto his neighbours wife, no man shall be guiltless who toucheth her!

30. Men despise not a thief, when he stealeth, to satisfy his appetite, because he is famished;

31. Yet, if found, he must pay back sevenfold, All the substance of his house, must he give:

32. He that committeth adultery with a woman, lacketh sense, A destroyer of his own life, is he that doeth it;

33. Smiting and shame, shall he find, and, his reproach, shall not be wiped out;

34. For, jealousy, is the rage of a man, nor will he spare, in the day of avenging;

35. He will not look, at any ransom, neither will he consent, though thou increase the bribe.

## Proverbs 7

1. My son, keep my sayings, and, my commandments, treasure by thee;

2. Keep my commandments and live, and mine instruction, as the pupil of thine eye;

3. Bind them upon thy fingers, write them, on the tablet of thy heart;

4. Say unto wisdom, My sister, thou! and, an acquaintance, call thou, understanding:

5. That thou mayest be kept, from the woman that is a stranger, from the female unknown, who, with her speeches, doth flatter.

6. For, in the window of my house, through my lattice, I looked out;

7. And saw among the simple ones, discerned among the youths, A young man lacking sense;

8. Passing through the street, near her corner, and, on the way to her house, he sauntered along;

9. In the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the midst of the night, and the gloom;

10. And lo! a woman, came to meet him, attired as one unchaste, of a wily heart.

11. Boisterous, is she, and rebellious, In her house, abide not her feet;

12. Now outside, now in the broadways, and, near every corner, she lieth in wait:

13. So she caught him, and kissed him, and, embolding her face, she said to him:

14. Peace-offerings, are by me, to-day, have I paid my vows;

15. For this cause, came I forth to meet thee, to seek diligently thy face, and I have found thee:

16. Coverlets, have I spread on my couch of pleasure, dark-hued stuffs, of the yarn of Egypt;

17. I have sprinkled my bed, with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon:

18. Come! let us take our fill of endearments, until morning, let us delight ourselves with caresses;

19. For the husband is not in his house, he hath gone on a journey afar;

20. A bag of silver, hath he taken in his hand, On the day of the full moon, will he enter his house.

21. She turneth him aside, with her great persuasiveness,with the flattery of her lips, she compelleth him:

22. Going after her instantly, as an ox, to the slaughter, he entereth, and, as in fetters, unto the correction of a fool.

23. Until an arrow cleaveth his liver, as a bird hasteth into a snare, and knoweth not, that, for his life, it is!

24. Now, therefore, ye sons, hearken unto me, and attend, to the sayings of my mouth;

25. Let not thy heart, turn aside to her ways, Do not go astray, in her paths.

26. For, many, wounded, hath she caused to fail,yea strong men, slain wholly by her:

27. Ways to hades, are in her house, descending into the chambers of death.

## Proverbs 8

1. Doth not, wisdom, cry aloud? and, understanding, send forth her voice?

2. At the top of the high places above the way, at the place where paths meet, she taketh her stand:

3. Beside the gates, at the entrance of the city,at the going in of the openings, she shouteth:

4. Unto you, O men, I call, and, my voice, is unto the sons of men;

5. Understand, ye simple ones, shrewdness, and, ye dullards understand sense;

6. Hear, for, princely things, will I speak, and the opening of my lips shall be of equity;

7. For, faithfulness, shall my mouth softly utter, but, the abomination of my lips, shall be lawlessness;

8. In righteousness, shall be all the sayings of my mouth, nothing therein, shall be crafty or perverse;

9. All of them, shall be plain, to them who would understand, and just, to such as would gain knowledge.

10. Receive my correction, and not silver, and knowledge, rather than choicest gold.

11. For better is wisdom, than ornaments of coral, and, no delightful things, can equal her.

12. I, wisdom, inhabit shrewdness,and, the knowledge of sagacious things, I gain.

13. The reverence of Yahweh, is to hate wickedness: pride, arrogance, and the way of wickedness; And a mouth of perverse things, do I hate.

14. Mine, are counsel, and effective working, I, am understanding, mine, is valour:

15. By me, kings reign, and dignitaries decree righteousness;

16. By me, rulers govern, and noblesall the righteous judges:

17. I love, them who love me, and, they who diligently seek me, find me:

18. Riches and honour, are with me, lordly wealth, and righteousness;

19. Better is my fruit, than goldyea fine gold, and mine increase, than choice silver;

20. In the way of righteousness, I march along, in the middle of the paths of justice:

21. That I may cause them who love me to inherit substance, and, their treasuries, I may fill.

22. Yahweh, had constituted me the beginning of his way, before his works, at the commencement of that time;

23. At the outset of the ages, had I been established, in advance of the antiquities of the earth;

24. When there was no resounding deep, I had been brought forth, when there were no fountains, abounding with water;

25. Ere yet the mountains had been settled, before the hills, had I been brought forth;

26. Or ever he had made the land and the wastes, or the top of the dry parts of the world:

27. When he prepared the heavens, there, was I! When he decreed a vault upon the face of the resounding deep;

28. When he made firm the skies above, when the fountains of the resounding deep, waxed strong;

29. When he fixed for the sea its bound, that, the waters, should not go beyond his bidding, when he decreed the foundations of the earth:

30. Then became I beside him, a firm and sure worker, then became I filled with delight, day by day, exulting before him on every occasion;

31. Exulting in the fruitful land of his earth, Yea, my fulness of delight, was with the sons of men.

32. Now, therefore, ye sons, hearken to me, for how happy are they who, to my ways, pay regard!

33. Hear ye correction, and be wise, and do not neglect.

34. How happy the man that doth hearken to me,keeping guard at my doors, day by day, watching at the posts of my gates;

35. For, he that findeth me, findeth life, and hath obtained favour from Yahweh;

36. But, he that misseth me, wrongeth his own soul, all who hate me, love death.

## Proverbs 9

1. Wisdom, hath builded her house, hath hewn out her seven pillars;

2. hath slaughtered her beasts, hath mingled her wine, hath even set in order her table;

3. hath sent forth her maidens, She crieth aloud, upon the tops of the heights of the city:

4. Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither, as for him that lacketh sense, she saith to him

5. Come, feed on my food, and drink of the wine I have mingled;

6. Forsake the simple ones, and live, and advance in the way of understanding.

7. He that rebuketh a scoffer, getteth to himself contempt, and, he that reproveth a lawless man,   his shame.

8. Do not reprove a scoffer, lest he hate thee, Reprove a wise man, and he will love thee.

9. Give to a wise man, and he will be wiser still, Inform a righteous man, and he will increase learning.

10. The beginning of wisdom, is the reverence of Yahweh, and, the knowledge of the Holy, is understanding;

11. For, by me, shall be multipliedthy days, and there be added to theethe years of life.

12. If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself, but, if thou scoff, alone, shalt thou bear it.

13. The woman Stupidity, is boisterous, so simple that she knoweth not what she would do;

14. So she sitteth at the entrance of her house, upon a seat, in the heights of the city;

15. To invite them who pass by the way, who are going straight on in their paths:

16. Whoso is simple, let him turn aside hither, and, as for him that lacketh sense, she saith to him:

17. Stolen waters, will be sweet,and a secret meal, will be pleasant;

18. But he knoweth not, that the shades are there; In the depths of hades, are her guests.

17. The eye that mocketh a father, and despiseth to obey a mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young of the eagle shall eat it.

18. Three, things there are, too difficult for me, yea, four, which I do not understand:

19. The way of an eagle in the heavens, the way of a serpent on the rock,the way of a ship in the heart of the sea, and the way of a man with a maid.

20. So, is the way of a woman committing adultery,she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no iniquity!

21. Under three things, a land is stirred, yea, under four, she cannot bear up:

22. Under a servant, when he reigneth, and a base man, when he is surfeited with food;

23. Under a hateful woman, when she is married, and a handmaid when she driveth out her mistress.

24. Four, things there are, the small of the earth,yet, they, are wiser than the wise:

25. The ants, a people, not strong,yet prepare they, in summer, their food;

26. The conies, a people of, no power, yet set they, among the crags, their house;

27. King, is there none, to, the locusts,yet go forth in swarms, do they all;

28. The lizard, with hands, reneweth its hold,yet, the same, is in the palaces of the king.

29. Three, things there are which step along well, ye, four, which excel in going:

30. The lion, hero among beasts, which turneth aside from the face of no one;

31. The greyhound, or the he-goat,and a king, having a band of soldiers with him.

32. If thou hast acted basely by lifting thyself up,if thou hast plotted evil,   mouth!

33. Surely, the pressing of milk, bringeth forth curd, and, the pressing of the nose, bringeth forth blood, and, the pressing of wrath, bringeth forth strife.

## Proverbs 31

1. The words of Lemuel the king,the strain which was taught him by his mother:

2. What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? aye what, the son of my vows?

3. Do not give, to women, thy strength, nor thy ways, to them who ruin kings.

4. It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, nor, for dignitaries, to desire strong drink,

5. Lest he drink, and forget that which is decreed, and alter the plea of any who are sorely oppressed.

6. Give strong drink, to him that is perishing, and wine, to such as are embittered in soul:

7. Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and, his wearying toil, let him remember no more.

8. Open thy mouth for the dumb, for the cause of all the children of the departed.

9. Open thy mouthjudge righteously,and administer justice for the poor and the needy.

10. A virtuous woman, who can find? for, far beyond corals, is her worth.

11. The heart of her husband, trusteth her, and, gain, he shall not lack:

12. She doeth him good and not evil, all the days of her life:

13. She seeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands:

14. She is like the ships of the merchant, from afar, she bringeth in her food;

15. And she riseth, while yet it is night, and giveth food to her household, and a task to her maidens:

16. She considereth a field, and procureth it, Out of the fruit of her hands, she planteth a vineyard:

17. She girdeth, with strength her loins, and putteth vigour into her arms:

18. She tasteth, whether, good, be her merchandise, and her lamp, goeth not out by night:

19. Her hands, she putteth forth to the distaff, and, her palms, lay hold of the spindle:

20. Her palm, she spreadeth out to the oppressed, and, her hands, she extendeth to the needy:

21. She feareth not, for her household, because of the snow, for, all her household, are clothed with crimson:

22. Coverlets, she maketh for herself, Of white linen and of purple, is her clothing:

23. Known in the gates, is her husband, when he sitteth, with the elders of the land:

24. Fine linen wraps, she maketh and selleth, and, girdles, doth she deliver to the trader:

25. Strength and dignity, are her clothing, and she laugheth at the time to come:

26. Her mouth, she openeth with wisdom, and, the instruction of kindness, is on her tongue:

27. She looketh well to the goings of her household, and, the bread of idleness, will she not eat.

28. Her children rise up, and call her happy! her husband, and he praiseth her:

29. Many daughters, have done virtuously, but, thou, excellest them all!

30. Deceitful is loveliness and vain is beauty, The woman that revereth Yahweh, she, shall be praised:

31. Give her of the fruit of her own hands, and let her own works, praise her in the gates.
