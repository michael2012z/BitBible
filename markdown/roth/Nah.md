# Nahum

## Nahum 1

__For strictly observed are the statutes of Omri, and every doing of the house of Ahab, and ye have walked in their counsels,to the end I may give thee up to desolation, and her inhabitants to hissing, that, the reproach of peoples, ye may bear.__

1. The oracle, on Nineveh,the scroll of the vision of Nahum, the Elkoshite.

2. A GOD jealous and avenging, is Yahweh, an avenger, is Yahweh, and a lord of wrath, an avenger, is Yahweh towards his adversaries, and, a retainer   , is he to his foes.

3. Yahweh, is slow to anger, but great in vigour, He will not leave, unpunished, as for Yahweh, in storm-wind and in tempest, is his way, and, clouds, are the dust of his feet.

4. Who rebuketh the sea and hath made it dry, and, all the streams, hath he dried up,withered are Bashan and Carmel, Even the bloom of Lebanon, is withered:

5. Mountains, have trembled because of him, and, the hills, have melted,and the earth, hath lifted itself up, at his presence, the world also, and all who dwell therein.

6. Before his indignation, who shall stand? And who shall abide the glow of his anger? His wrath, hath been poured forth like fire, and, the rocks, have been broken down because of him.

7. Good is Yahweh, as a protection in the day of distress,and one who acknowledgeth them who seek refuge in him.

8. But, with an overflow rolling on, a full end, will he make of them who rise up against him,and, his foes, will he pursue into darkness.

9. What can ye devise against Yahweh? A full end, is he making,Distress, shall not rise up twice:

10. Though they were like thorns intertwined, and as drunkards drenched with their drink, yet have they been devoured, like stubble fully dry.

11. Out of thee, hath one come forthplotting, against Yahweh, wickedness,A counselor of the Abandoned One.

12. Thus, saith Yahweh, Though they be in full force, and so in great numbers, yet, even so, have they been cut off, and have passed away,If I humble thee   , I will not humble thee again.

13. Now, therefore, will I break his yoke from off thee,and, thy fetters, will I tear off.

14. Then will Yahweh give command concerning thee, None of thy name shall be sown any more,out of the house of thy gods, will I cut off carved image and molten image, I will appoint thy grave, for thou art of little esteem.

15. Lo! upon the mountains, The feet of one, who bringeth Good Tidings! who publisheth Prosperity! Celebrate, O Judah, thy pilgrim festivals, fulfil thy vows, for, not again, any more, shall the Abandoned One, pass through thee, he hath been wholly cut off.

## Nahum 2

1. He that breaketh in pieces hath come up over thy face, Keep the keeps,watch the way, brace the loins, make vigour very firm.

2. For Yahweh hath restored the excellency of Jacob, like the excellency of Israel,for the plunderers have plundered them, and, their vine branches, have they marred.

3. The shield of his heroes, is made red, the men of war, are clad in crimson, on fire, are the chariot-steels, on the day he maketh ready,and, the lances, are put in motion.

4. In the streets, madly go the chariots, they rush along in the broadways,their appearance, is like torches, as lightnings, hither and thither do they run.

5. Let him call to mind his nobles, they shall stumble as they golet them hasten to her wall, yet the storming cover, is prepared.

6. The gates of the rivers, have been opened,and, the palace, doth quake.

7. And, Huzzab, hath been taken captivehath been led up,and, her handmaids, are making a moan like the sound of doves, as they taber upon their heart.

8. Yet, as for Nineveh, like a reservoir of waters, are her waters,but, those men, are in flight! Stand! stand!! but no one is turning.

9. Plunder silver, plunder gold,and there is no end to the costly furnishing, rich with every article of delight.

10. Emptiness, yea turned to emptiness, aye deserted

11. Where is the lair of the lions? Yea the very feeding-place of the young lions,where walked the lion, the lioness, the lions whelp, with none to make them afraid?

12. The lion, used to tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and to strangle for his lionesses,and then fill with prey his holes, and his lairs with what he had torn.

13. Behold me! against thee, Declareth Yahweh of hosts, Therefore will I burn up in smoke her chariots, and, thy young lions, shall be devoured by the sword,so will I cut off, out of the earth, thy prey, nor shall be heard any more, the voice of thine envoy.

## Nahum 3

1. Alas for the city of bloodshed! All of it, deceit, of violence full, none releaseth prey!

2. The sound of the whip, and the sound of the rushing wheel,and horse galloping, and dancing chariot rattling along.

3. Horsemen uplifting both the flashing sword, and the lightning spear, Aye, a mass of slain, and a weight of dead bridles,and no end of corpses, so that they stumble upon their corpses.

4. Because of the multitude of the unchaste doings of the unchaste one, fair in grace, mistress of secret arts,who hath been selling nations by her unchaste doings, families by her secret arts,

5. Behold me! against thee, Declareth Yahweh of hosts, Therefore will I remove thy shirts over thy face,and let, nations, see thy nakedness, and, kingdoms, thy shame;

6. And I will cast upon thee abominable filth, and treat thee as foolish,and set thee as a gazing-stock.

7. And it shall come to pass that, all who see thee, shall flee from thee, and shall say, Destroyed is Nineveh! Who will bemoan her?Whence shall I seek any to comfort thee?

8. Art thou better than No-amon, who sat among the Nile-streams, waters round about her,whose fortress was the sea, from the sea, her wall.

9. Ethiopia, was her strength, and EgyptYea, without end,Put and Lubim, were among thy helpers.

10. Yet, she, was given up to exile, she went into captivity, even her babes, were dashed to the ground, at the head of all the streets,and, for her honourable men, cast they lots, and, all her great men, were bound together in chains.

11. Thou too, shalt be drunken, thou shalt hide thyself,thou too, shalt seek shelter from the foe:

12. All thy fortresses, shall be fig-trees with first-ripe figs: if thy be shaken, then shall   fall on the mouth of the eater.

13. Lo! thy people, are women, in thy midst, to thy foes, have been set wide open the gates of thy and,a fire, hath devoured, thy bars.

14. Siege-water, draw for thyself, strengthen thy fortresses,go into the clay, and tread thou the mortar, make strong the brick.

15. There, shall a fire devour thee, the sword, shall cut thee off, it shall devour thee like the grass locust, make thyself numerous like the grass locust, make thyself numerous as the swarming locust:

16. Though thou have multiplied thy foot-soldiers beyond the stars of the heavens, the grass locust, hath stript itself and flown away!

17. Thy mercenary crowds, are like the swarming locust, and, thy mixed multitudes, like locustsswarms of locusts,which settle in the hedges on a cold day, the sun, hath broken forth, and they are in flight, and unknown is the place where they are!

18. Asleep are thy shepherds, O king of Assyria, thy nobles, must needs rest. Scattered are thy people upon the mountains, and there is none to gather them.

19. No lessening of thine injury, grievous is thy wound,all who have heard the report of thee, have clapped their hands over thee, for, upon whom, hath not thy cruelty passed without ceasing?
