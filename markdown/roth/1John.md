## 1 John 1

__There hath befallen them the thing__

1. That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we for ourselves gazed upon, and our hands did handle, concerning the Word of Life,

2. And, the Life, was made manifest, and we have seen, and are bearing witness, and announcing unto you, the Age-abiding Life, which, indeed, was with the Father, and was made manifest unto us;

3. That which we have seen and heard, are we announcing, even unto you, in order that, ye too, may have fellowship with us, and, our own fellowship also, may be with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.

4. And, these things, are we writing, in order that, our joy, may be made full.

5. And this is the message which we have heard from him, and are reporting unto you,that, God, is, light, and in him is, no darkness at all.

6. If we sayWe have, fellowship, with him! and, in darkness, are walking, we are dealing falsely, and not doing the truth;

7. Whereas, if, in the light, we are walking, as, he, is in the light, we have, fellowship one with another, and, the blood of Jesus his Son, is cleansing us from all sin.

8. If we saySin, have we none! we are deceiving, ourselves, and, the truth, is not in us.

9. If we are confessing our sins, faithful, is he and, righteousthat he should forgive us our sins, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

10. If we sayWe have not sinned! false, are we making, him, and, his word, is not in us.

## 1 John 2

1. My dear children! these things, am I writing unto you, in order that ye may not be committing sin. And, if anyone should commit sin, an Advocate, have we, with the Father, Jesus Christ, the Righteous;

2. And, he, is, a propitiation, concerning our sins,and, not concerning our own only, but, also concerning those of the whole world.

3. And, hereby, perceive we, that we understand him,if, his commandments, we are keeping.

4. He that saithI understand him! And, his commandments, is not keeping, is false, and, in him, the truth is not!

5. But whosoever may be keeping his word, of a truth, in this man, the love of God hath been made perfect. Hereby, perceive we, that, in him, we are.

6. He that saith, that, in him, he abideth, ought, just as He walked, himself also, to be walking.

7. Beloved! no new commandment, am I writing unto you; but an old commandment, which ye have been holding from the beginning: The old commandment is the word which ye have heard.

8. Again, a new commandment, am I writing unto you,which thing is true, in him and in you, because, the darkness, is passing away, and, the real light, already is shining.

9. He that saith he is, in the light, and hateth, his brother, is, in the darkness, until even now!

10. He that loveth his brother, is abiding, in the light, and, cause of stumbling, in him, is there none.

11. Whereas, he that hateth his brother, in the darkness, dwelleth, and in the darkness, walketh; and knoweth not whither he is drifting, because the, darkness, hath blinded his eyes.

12. I write unto you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven you, for the sake of his name:

13. I write unto you, fathers, because ye understand him who was from the beginning: I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I have written unto you, little children, because ye understand the Father:

14. I have written unto you, fathers, because ye understand him who was from the beginning: I have written you, young men, because ye are, strong, and the word of God, within you, abideth, and ye have overcome the wicked one.

15. Be not loving the world, nor yet the things that are in the world: if anyone be loving the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

16. Because, all that is in the worldthe coveting of the flesh, the coveting of the eyes, and the vain grandeur of lifeis not of the Father, but is, of the world;

17. And, the world, passeth away, and the coveting  thereof , but, he that doeth the will of God, endureth unto times age-abiding.

18. Little children! it is, the last hour; and, just as ye have heard that, an antichrist, is coming, even now, antichrists have become, many, whence we perceive that it is, the last hour:

19. From among us, they went out, but they were not of us; for, if, of us, they had been, they would in that case have abode with us; but

20. And, ye, have, an anointing, from the Holy One,Ye all, know:

21. I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and because, no falsehood, is, of the truth.

22. Who, is the False One;save he that denieth that, Jesus, is the Christ? The same, is the Antichrist,he that denieth the Father and the Son.

23. Whosoever denieth the Son, neither hath he, the Father: He that confesseth the Son, hath, the Father also.

24. As for you, what ye have heard from the beginning, in you, let it abide. If, in you, shall abide, that which, from the beginning, ye have heard, ye also, in the Son, and  in  the Father, shall abide.

25. And, this, is the promise, which he hath promised unto us,The age-abiding life.

26. These things, have I written unto you, concerning them who would lead you astray.

27. And, as for you, the anointing which ye have received from him, abideth in you, and ye have, no need, that anyone be teaching you; but, as, his anointing, is teaching you, and is, true, and is no falsehood, even just as it hath taught you, abide ye in him.

28. And, now, dear children, abide ye in him, in order that, if he be made manifest, we may have boldness, and not be shamed away from him by his presence.

29. If ye know that he is, righteous, ye perceive thatwhosoever doeth righteousness, of him, hath been born.

## 1 John 3

1. Behold, what manner of love, the Father hath bestowed upon usthat, children of God, we should be called,and such we are! Therefore, the world understandeth us not, because it understood not him.

2. Beloved! now, are we, children of God; and, not yet, hath it been made manifest, what we shall be,We know that, if it should be made manifest, like unto him, shall we be, because we shall see him, just as he is.

3. And, whosoever hath this hope on him, is purifying himself, just as, He, is pure.

4. Whosoever is committing sin, lawlessness also, is committing, and, sin, is, lawlessness;

5. And ye know, that, He, was made manifestin order that, our sins, he should take away, and, sin, in him, is there none.

6. Whosoever, in him, doth abide, is not sinning: whosoever is sinning, hath not seen him, and doth not understand him.

7. Dear children! Let, no one, lead you astray! He that is doing righteousness, is, righteous, just as, He, is righteous:

8. He that is committing sin, is, of the adversary, because, from the beginning, the adversary is sinning. To this end, was the Son of God made manifest, in order that he might undo the works of the adversary.

9. Whosoever hath been born of God, is not committing, sin, because, a seed of him, within him, abideth; and he cannot be committing sin, because, of God, hath he been born.

10. Herein, are, manifest, the children of God, and the children of the adversary: Whoever is not doing righteousness, is not of God, nor yet he that is not loving his brother.

11. Because, this, is the message which ye have heard from the beginningthat we should be loving one another,

12. Not just as, Cain, was, of the wicked one, and slew his brother! And, for what cause, slew he him? Because, his works, were, wicked, whereas, those of his brother, were, righteous.

13. Be not marveling, brethren, if, the world, is hating you:

14. We, know, that we have passed over out of death into life, because we love the brethren: he that loveth not, abideth in death.

15. Whosoever is hating his brother, is, a murderer; and ye know that, no murderer, hath life age-during, within him abiding.

16. Hereby, have we come to understand love: in that, He, for us, his life laid down; and, we, ought, for the brethren, our lives to lay down.

17. But, whoso hath this worlds goods, and beholdeth his brother having, need, and shutteth up his tender affections from him, how, is, the love of God, abiding in him?

18. Dear children! Let us not be loving in word, nor yet with the tongue, but in deed and truth.

19. Hereby, shall we get to know, that, of the truth, we are, and, before him, shall persuade our heart;

20. Because, if our own heart condemn us, greater, is God, than our heart, and perceiveth all things.

21. Beloved! if our heart be not condemning us, boldness, have we, towards God;

22. And, whatsoever we are asking, we are receiving from him, because, his commandments, are we keeping, and, the things that are pleasing before him, are we doing.

23. And, this, is his commandment,that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and be loving one anotherjust as he gave a commandment unto us.

24. And, he that keepeth his commandments, in him, abideth, and, he, in him. And, hereby, perceive we, that he abideth in us, by reason of the Spirit which, unto us, he hath given.

## 1 John 4

1. Beloved! not in every spirit, believe ye, but test the spirits, whether they are, of God; because, many false prophets, have gone out into the world.

2. Hereby, do ye perceive the Spirit of God:every spirit that confesseth Jesus Christ as having come, in flesh, is, of God;

3. And, every spirit that doth not confess Jesus, of God, is not. And, this, is the

4. Ye, are, of God, dear children, and have overcome them; because, greater, is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.

5. They, are, of the world: For this cause, of the world, they speak, and the world, unto them, doth hearken.

6. We, are, of God: he that is getting to understand God, hearkeneth unto us,whoso is not of God, hearkeneth not unto us: from this, perceive wethe spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.

7. Beloved! let us be loving one another; because, love, is, of God, and, whosoever loveth, of God, hath been born, and is getting to understand God:

8. He that doth not love, doth not understand God, because, God, is, love.

9. Herein, hath the love of God in us, been made manifest, that, his only-begotten Son, God sent into the world, in order that we might live through him.

10. Herein, is love: not that, we, have loved God, but that, he, loved us, and sent forth his Son, as a propitiation concerning our sins.

11. Beloved! If, in this way, God, loved us, we also, ought to love, one another.

12. Upon God, hath no one, at any time, gazed: If we love one another, God, in us, abideth, and, his love, hath been perfected within us.

13. Hereby, perceive wethat, in him, are we abiding, and, he, in us,in that, of his Spirit, hath he given unto us.

14. And, we, for ourselves have gazed, and are bearing witnessthat, the Father, sent forth the Son, as Saviour of the world.

15. Whosoever shall confess, that, Jesus  Christ  is the Son of God, God, in him, abideth, and, he, in God.

16. And, we, have come to understand and to trust the love which, God, hath, in us. God, is, love; and, he that abideth in love, in God, abideth, and, God, in him  abideth .

17. Herein, hath love with us, been made perfect,in order that, boldness, we might have in the day of judging,in that, just as, He, is, we also, are, in this world.

18. Fear, existeth not, in love, but, perfect love, casteth fear, outside; because, fear, hath correction: he that feareth, hath not been made perfect, in love.

19. We, love, because, he, first loved us:

20. If one should say, I love God, and should be hating, his brother, false, is he; for, he that doth not love his brother, whom he hath seen, God, whom he hath not seen, he cannot love!

21. And, this commandment, have we from him,that, he who loveth God, love, his brother also.

## 1 John 5

1. Whosoever believeth that, Jesus, is the Christ, of God, hath been born: and, whosoever loveth him that begat, loveth him that hath been begotten of him.

2. Hereby, perceive we, that we love the children of God, as soon as, God, we love, and, his commandments, we are doing.

3. For, this is the love of Godthat, his commandments, we be keeping, and, his commandments, are not burdensome;

4. Because, whatsoever hath been born of God, overcometh the world; and, this, is the victory that hath overcome the worldour faith.

5.  And  who is he that overcometh the world, save he that believeth that, Jesus, is the Son of God?

6. This, is he that came through means of water and blood, Jesus Christ: not, by the water, only, but, by the water and by the blood,and, the Spirit, it is, that is bearing witness, because, the Spirit, is the truth.

7. Because, three, are they who are bearing witness

8. The Spirit, and the Water, and the Blood; and, the three, are,   , unto one thing.

9. If, the witness of men, we receive, the witness of God, is, greater. Because, this, is the witness of Godin that he hath borne witness concerning his Son,

10. He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the witness, within himself: He that doth not believe God, false, hath made him,because he hath not believed on the witness which, God, hath witnessed, concerning his Son

11. And, this, is the witness:that, life age-abiding, hath God given unto us, and, this life, is, in his Son:

12. He that hath the Son, hath, the life,he that hath not the Son of God, hath not, the life.

13. These things, have I written unto youin order that ye may know that ye have, Life Age-abidingunto you who believe on the name of the Son of God.

14. And, this, is the boldness which we have towards him: that, if, anything, we ask, according to his will, He doth hearken unto us.

15. And, if we know that he doth hearken unto us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the things asked, which we have asked of him,

16. If one should see his brother committing a sin, not unto death, he shall ask, and He will grant unto him life,for them who are sinning, not unto death. There, is, a sin, unto death: not concerning that, am I saying, that he should make request.

17. All unrighteousness, is, sin, and there, is, a sin, not unto death.

18. We know that, whosoever hath been born of God, is not committing sin,Nay, he that hath been born of God, He keepeth him, and, the wicked one, doth not touch him.

19. We know that, of God, are we; and, the whole world, in the wicked one, is lying.

20. We know, moreover, that, the Son of God, hath come, and hath given us insight, so that we are getting to understand, him that is Real,and we are in him that is Real, in his Son Jesus Christ. This, is the Real God, and life age-abiding.

21. Dear children! Guard yourselves from idols.
