## Joshua 1

__How happy art thou, O Israel! Who is like unto thee, O people victorious in Yahweh? Thy helpful shield, who also is thy majestic sword,So that thy foes come cringing unto thee, And, thou, upon their heights, dost march along.__

1. And it came to pass, after the death of Moses the servant of Yahweh,that Yahweh spake unto Joshua son of Nun, the attendant of Moses, saying:

2. Moses my servant, is dead,Now, therefore, arise, pass over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, into the land which I am giving unto themunto the sons of Israel.

3. Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread, unto you, have I given it,as I spake unto Moses.

4. From the desert and this Lebanon, even unto the great riverthe river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea, toward the going in of the sun, shall be your boundary.

5. No man shall stand before thee, all the days of thy life,as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee, I will not fail thee, neither will I forsake thee.

6. Be firm and bold,for, thou, shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I sware unto their fathers,to give unto them.

7. Only be very firm and bold, taking heed to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee, do not turn aside therefrom, to the right hand or to the left,that thou mayest prosper, whithersoever thou goest.

8. This scroll of the law must not cease out of thy mouth, but thou must talk to thyself therein, day and night, that thou mayest take heed to do according to all that is written therein,for, then, shalt thou make thy way prosperous, and, then, shalt thou have good success.

9. Have I not commanded thee, Be firm and bold, do not start nor be dismayed,for, with thee, is Yahweh thy God, whithersoever thou goest?

10. So then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying:

11. Pass ye through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying: Make ready for yourselves, provisions,for, in three days more, are ye to pass over this Jordan, to go in and possess the land which Yahweh your God is giving you, to possess.

12. And, unto the Reubenites, and unto the Gadites, and unto the half tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying:

13. Remember the word which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you, saying,Yahweh your God, is granting you rest, and doth give you this land.

14. Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses hath given you over the Jordan,but, ye, shall pass over, armed, before your brethren,all ye mighty men of valour, and shall help them;

15. until that Yahweh shall grant rest unto your brethren, as unto you, so shall, they also, possess the land which Yahweh your God giveth them,then shall ye return unto the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of Yahweh hath given you over the Jordan, towards the rising of the sun.

16. Then responded they to Joshua, saying,All that thou hast commanded us, will we do, and, whithersoever thou shalt send us, will we go:

17. As in every thing we hearkened unto Moses, so, will we hearken unto thee,only let Yahweh thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.

18. Any man who shall rebel against thy bidding, and not hearken unto thy words in all that thou shalt command him, shall be put to death,only be firm and bold.

## Joshua 2

1. Then did Joshua son of Nun, send out from The Acacias, two men to spy out silently, saying, Go view the land, and Jericho. So they came, and entered the house of a harlot, whose name was Rahab, and lay there.

2. And it was told the king of Jericho, saying,Lo! men, have come in hither to-night of the sons of Israel to search out the land.

3. So the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying,Bring forth the men that are come in unto thee who have entered thy house, for, to search out all the land, have they come.

4. And the woman took the two men and hid them,and said: Even so, the men did come in unto me, but I knew not from whence they were;

5. and it came to pass, as the gate was about to be shut in the darkness, that, the men, went out, I know not whither the men went,pursue them quickly for ye shall overtake them.

6. But, she, had taken them up to the roof,and concealed them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order for herself upon the roof.

7. So, the men, pursued them by way of the Jordan unto the fords,the gate being shut as soon as they who pursued them had gone forth.

8. And, ere yet they slept, she, went up unto them, upon the roof;

9. and said unto the men, I know that Yahweh hath given unto you the land,and that the terror of you hath fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land, have melted away, from before you.

10. For we have heard how Yahweh, dried up, the waters of the Red Sea from before you, when ye came forth out of Egypt,and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites who were over the Jordan unto Sihon and unto Og, whom ye devoted to destruction;

11. and, when we heard, then did our heart melt, and there rose up no longer any spirit in any man because of you,for, as for Yahweh your God, he, is Godin the heavens above, and upon the earth beneath.

12. Now, therefore I pray you, swear unto me by Yahweh, since I have dealt with you in lovingkindness, that, ye also, will deal with the house of my father in lovingkindness, and will give me a token of faithfulness,

13. and will save alive my father and my mother, and my brethren and my sisters, and all that they have,and will deliver our souls from death.

14. And the men said unto her, Our souls in your stead unto death, if ye utter not this our business,so shall it be, when Yahweh shall give us the land, that we will deal with thee in lovingkindness and in faithfulness.

15. And she let them down with a cord through the window,for, her house, was within the wall of the rampart, and, within the rampart, she was dwelling.

16. And she said unto themTo the mountain, get you, lest the pursuers, fall in, with you,and hide yourselves there, three days until the pursuers return, and, afterwards, shall ye go your way.

17. And the men said unto her,Free, will we be from this thine oath which thou hast made us swear:

18. Lo! when we are coming into the land, this cord of crimson thread, must thou bind in the window by which thou didst let us down, and, thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all the household of thy father, must thou gather together unto thee unto the house.

19. And it shall be, whosoever shall go forth out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood, shall be on his own head and, we, shall be free,but, whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood, shall be on our heads, if a, hand, be upon him.

20. Or, if thou utter this our business, then shall we be free from this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.

21. And she saidAccording to your words, so, shall it be. Thus sent she them away and they departed,and she bound the crimson cord in the window.

22. And they went and came into the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers had returned,so the pursuers, made search, throughout all the way, but found them not.

23. And the two men returned and came down out of the mountain, and crossed over and came unto Joshua, son of Nun,and recounted to him all that had befallen them;

24. and they said unto Joshua, Yahweh, hath delivered, into our hand all the land,moreover also all the inhabitants of the land, have melted away, from before us.

## Joshua 3

1. So then Joshua rose early in the morning, and they brake up from The Acacias and came as far as the Jordan, he and all the sons of Israel,and they lodged there before they passed over.

2. And it came to pass, after three days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp,

3. and commanded the people saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God, and, the priests the Levites, bearing it, ye also, shall break up out of your place, and come after it.

4. Yet shall there be, a distance, between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure,do not come near unto it that ye may get to know the way by which ye must go, for ye have not passed this way, heretofore.

5. Then said Joshua unto the people, Hallow yourselves,for, to-morrow, will Yahweh do in your midst, wonderful things.

6. And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take ye up the ark of the covenant, and pass on before the people. So they took up the ark of the covenant, and went on before the people.

7. Then said Yahweh unto Joshua: This day, will I begin to magnify thee in the eyes of all Israel,who shall know, that, as I was with Moses, I will be with thee.

8. Thou, therefore, shalt command the priests who am bearing the ark of the covenant, saying,When ye are come as far as the edge of the waters of the Jordan, in the Jordan, shall ye stand.

9. Then said Joshua, unto the sons of Israel,Draw near hither, and hear ye the words of Yahweh your God.

10. And Joshua said, Hereby, shall ye know, that a Living GOD is in your midst,and that he will, certainly dispossess, from before you, the Canaanite and the Hittite, and the Hivite and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite.

11. Lo! the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth, is about to pass before you into the Jordan.

12. Now, therefore, take you twelve men, out of the tribes of Israel,one man severally for each tribe;

13. and it shall be, when the soles of the feet of the priests who are bearing the ark of Yahweh, Lord of all the earth, do rest, in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan, shall be cut off, the waters that are coming down from above,and shall stand in one mound.

14. And it came to pass, when the people set out from their tents, to cross the Jordan,with the priests, bearing the ark of the covenant before the people,

15. then, as the bearers of the ark came as far as the Jordan, and, the feet of the priests who were bearing the ark, were dipped in the edge of the waters,the Jordan being full over all his banks, all the days of harvest,

16. that the waters which were coming down from above, stoodrose up in one mound, a great way off, by the city Adam, which is beside Zarethan, and, they which were going down to the sea of the waste plain, the salt sea, failedwere cut off,and, the people, passed over, right against Jericho.

17. And the priests who were bearing the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, stood on dry ground, in the midst of the Jordan, with firm footing,while all Israel were passing over on dry ground, until all the nation had made an end of passing over the Jordan.

## Joshua 4

1. And it came to pass, when all the nation had made an end of passing over the Jordan, that Yahweh slake unto Joshua, saying:

2. Take unto you, from among the people, twelve men, one man severally from each tribe;

3. and command ye them, saying, Take you up from hence, out of the midst of the Jordan, from the place where stood the feet of the priests with firm footing, twelve stones;and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging-place where ye shall lodge, tonight.

4. So Joshua called unto the twelve men whom he had made ready, from among the sons of Israel,one man severally out of each tribe;

5. and Joshua said unto them: Pass ye over, before the ark of Yahweh your God, into the midst of the Jordan,and lift ye up, each man one stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel:

6. that this may be a sign in your midst,for your sons will ask in time to come, saying, What mean these stones to you?

7. Then shall ye say unto themThat the waters of the Jordan, were cut off, from before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, when it passed into the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan, were cut off. So shall these stones become a memorial unto the sons of Israel, unto times age-abiding.

8. And the sons of Israel did so, as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as spake Yahweh unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel,and carried them with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.

9. Twelve stones also, did Joshua set up in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where stood the feet of the priests who were bearing the ark of the covenant,and they have remained there until this day.

10. Now, the priests who were bearing the ark, continued standing in the midst of the Jordan, until everything was finished which Yahweh commanded Joshua, to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua,the people therefore hasted, and passed over.

11. And so it was, as soon as all the people had made an end of passing over,then passed over the ark of Yahweh, and the priests, in presence of the people.

12. Also the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the hall tribe of Manasseh, passed over, armed, before the sons of Israel,as Moses had spoken unto them:

13. about forty thousand, equipped for the war, passed over before Yahweh, to battle, into the waste plains of Jericho.

14. On that day, did Yahweh magnify Joshua in the eyes of all Israel,and they revered him, as they revered Moses, all the days of his life.

15. Then spake Yahweh unto Joshua, saying:

16. Command the priests who are bearing the ark of testimony,that they come up out of the Jordan.

17. So Joshua commanded the priests, saying,Come ye up out of the Jordan.

18. And it came to pass, when the priests who were bearing the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came up out of the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the feet of the priests were withdrawn unto the dry ground, then returned the waters of the Jordan unto their place, and went, as before, over all his banks.

19. So, the people, came up out of the Jordan, on the tenth of the first month,and encamped in Gilgal, at the eastern end of Jericho.

20. And, these twelve stones which they took out of the Jordan, did Joshua set up, in Gilgal.

21. Then spake he unto the sons of Israel, saying,When your sons shall ask, in time to come, of their fathers, saying,What mean these stones?

22. then shall ye let your sons know, saying,On dry ground, came Israel over this Jordan;

23. in that Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan, from before you, until ye had passed over,as Yahweh your God had done unto the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we had passed over:

24. that all the peoples of the earth might know the hand of Yahweh, that, firm, it is; that they might revere Yahweh your God, all the days.

## Joshua 5

1. And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites who were over the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard how that Yahweh had dried up the waters of the Jordan, from before the sons of Israel, until they had passed over, that their heart melted, and there was no spirit in them any more, because of the sons of Israel.

2. At that time, said Yahweh unto Joshua, Make thee knives of flint,and again circumcise the sons of Israel, a second time.

3. So Joshua made him knives of flint,and circumcised the sons of Israel, at the Hill of Foreskins.

4. Now, this, is the cause why Joshua did circumcise,all the people who came forth out of Egypt, who were males, all the men of war, died in the desert, by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt.

5. For, though all the people who came forth had been circumcised, yet, all the people who were born in the desert by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt, had they not circumcised.

6. Because, for forty years, did the sons of Israel journey in the desert, until all the nation who were men of war, who came forth out of Egypt, were consumed, because they hearkened not unto the voice of Yahweh,unto whom Yahweh sware that he would not let them see the land, which Yahweh sware unto their fathers, that he would give unto us, a land flowing with milk and honey.

7. Their sons, therefore, whom he had raised up in their stead, them, did Joshua circumcise,for, uncircumcised, they were, in that they had not circumcised them by the way.

8. And so it came to pass, when they had made an end of circumcising all the nation, they remained in their place, in the camp, until they were healed.

9. Then said Yahweh unto Joshua, To-day, have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of that place is called Gilgal unto this day. \fs15

10. Thus then the sons of Israel encamped in Gilgal,and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, in the waste plains of Jericho.

11. And they did eat of the corn of the land, on the morrow of the passover, unleavened cakes and parched ears of corn,on this selfsame day.

12. And the manna ceased on the morrow, when they had eaten of the corn of the land, neither had the sons of Israel manna any more,so they did eat of the yield of the land of Canaan throughout that year.

13. And it came to pass, while Joshua was at Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes, and looked, and lo! a man standing over against him, with his sword drawn, in his hand,so Joshua went unto him, and said to him, For us, art thou, or for our adversaries?

14. And he saidNay, but, I, as prince of the host of Yahweh, have, now, come. So Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshipped, and said unto him, What is my lord speaking unto his servant?

15. Then said the prince of the host of Yahweh unto JoshuaSlip off thy sandals from thy feet, for, as for the place whereon thou art standing, holy, it is. And Joshua did so.

## Joshua 6

1. Now, Jericho, was shut up and barred because of the sons of Israel,none came out and none went in.

2. Then said Yahweh unto Joshua, See, I have delivered, into thy hand, Jericho and her king,the mighty men of valour.

3. So then ye shall compass the city all ye men of war, going round the city, once,thus, shall thou do six days.

4. And, seven priests, shall bear the seven rams horns before the ark, and, on the seventh day, shall ye compass the city seven times,and, the priests, shall blow with the horns.

5. And it shall come to pass, when the rams horn soundeth, when ye hear the sound of the horn, that all the people shall shout with a great shout,and then shall the wall of the city fall down under it, and the people shall go up, every man straight before him.

6. Then called Joshua son of Nun unto the priests, and said unto them, Bear ye the ark of the covenant,and let, seven priest, bear seven rams horns, before the ark of Yahweh.

7. Then said he unto the people, Pass on and compass the city,and let, the armed host, pass on before the ark of Yahweh.

8. And it was so, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that, the seven priests who were bearing the seven rams horns before Yahweh, passed on and blew with the horns,the ark of the covenant of Yahweh also coming after them.

9. And, the armed host, went on before the priests who blew with the horns,and, the rear-guard, came after the ark, going on and blowing with the horns.

10. Now, unto the people, had Joshua given command, sayingYe shall not shout nor let your voice be heard, neither shall there go out of your mouth, a word,until the day when I say unto you Shout! then shall ye shout.

11. So he caused the ark of Yahweh to compass the city, going round once,and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.

12. And Joshua rose early in the morning,and the priests bare the ark of Yahweh;

13. and, the seven priests who bare the seven rams horns before the ark of Yahweh, went on and on, and blew with the horns,with, the armed host going on before them, and, the rear-guard, coming after the ark of Yahweh, going on and blowing with the horns.

14. So they compassed the city on the second day once, and returned into the camp,thus, did they, six days.

15. And it came to pass, on the seventh day, that they rose early at the uprisings of the dawn, and compassed the city after this manner, seven times,only on that day they compassed the city seven times.

16. And it came to pass, at the seventh timewhen the priests blew with the horns, then did Joshua say unto the peopleShout, for Yahweh hath delivered unto you the city.

17. And it shall be, that, as for the city, devoted, shall it be and all that is therein unto Yahweh,nevertheless, Rahab the harlot, shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers whom we sent.

18. But, in any wise, do, ye, beware of what is devoted, lest ye should covet, and then take of what is devoted,and so cause the camp of Israel to be devoted, and bring trouble upon it.

19. But, as for all silver and gold and vessels of bronze and iron, hallowed, it is to Yahweh,unto the treasury of Yahweh, shall it come.

20. So the people shouted, when the horns were blown,yea it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the horn, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down under it, and the people went up into the city every man straight before him, and so they captured the city.

21. And they devoted all that were in the city, both man and woman, both young and old,and ox and sheep and ass, with the edge of the sword.

22. But, unto the two men who spied out the land, Joshua said, Go into the house of the woman, the harlot,and bring out thence the woman and all that she hath, as ye aware unto her.

23. So the young men the spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her brethren and all that she had, yea, all her kindred, brought they out,and set them outside the camp of Israel.

24. But, the city, burned they with fire, and all that was therein,save only, the silver and the gold and the vessels of bronze and of iron, put they into the treasury of the house of Yahweh.

25. And, Rahab the harlot and the household of her father and all that she had, did Joshua save alive, so she hath dwelt in the midst of Israel until this day,because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.

26. And Joshua imposed an oath at that time, saying,Cursed be the man before Yahweh who shall raise up and build this cityJericho, At the price of his firstborn, shall he lay its foundation, and, at the price of his youngest, shall he set up its doors.

27. And so it was that Yahweh was with Joshua,and his fame was in all the land.

## Joshua 7

1. But the sons of Israel had committed an act of unfaithfulness in respect of what was devoted,for Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah had taken of what was devoted, and the anger of Yahweh had kindled against the sons of Israel.

2. And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai which was beside Beth-aven on the east side of Bethel, and spake unto them saying, Go up and spy out the land. So the men went up, and spied out Ai.

3. And they returned unto Joshua and said unto himLet not all the people go up, about two thousand men or three thousand men, can go up and smite Ai,do not weary the whole people to go thither, for, but few, they are.

4. There went up thither of the people therefore, about three thousand men,but they fled before the men of Ai.

5. And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty-six men, and pursued them before the gate as far as the Shebarim, and smote them on the slope,so that the heart of the people melted and became as water.

6. Then Joshua rent his clothes and fell upon his face to the earth before the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he and the elders of Israel,and they lifted up dust upon their heads.

7. And Joshua saidAlas! My Lord Yahweh! Wherefore hast thou, brought, this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorite to destroy us? Would then we had been content to dwell on the other side of the Jordan!

8. Oh My Lord,what shall I say, after Israel have turned their backs before their enemies?

9. Only let the Canaanite and all the inhabitants of the land hear, and they will surround us, and cut off our name out of the earth,what then wilt thou do for thy great name?

10. And Yahweh said unto JoshuaGet thee up! wherefore is it that thou art lying upon thy face?

11. Israel hath sinned, yea moreover they have transgressed my covenant which I commanded them,yea moreover they have taken of what was devoted, yea moreover they have stolen, yea moreover they have dissembled, yea moreover they have put it among their own goods.

12. Therefore cannot the sons of Israel stand before their enemies, their back, do they turn before their enemies, because they have become devoted,I will no more be with you, except ye destroy the devoted thing out of your midst.

13. Up! hallow the people, and thou shalt say, Hallow yourselves by to-morrow,for, Thus, saith Yahweh, God of Israel: A devoted thing, is in the midst of thee O Israel, Thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye have put away the devoted thing out of your midst.

14. Therefore shall ye be brought near in the morning by your tribes,and it shall be thatthe tribe which Yahweh shall seize, shall come near, by families, and the family which Yahweh shall seize, shall come near, by households, and the household which Yahweh shall seize, shall come near, man by man;

15. and it shall be, thatHe that is seized with the devoted thing, shall be burned with fire, he and all that he hath,because he hath transgressed the covenant of Yahweh, and because he hath wrought impiety in Israel.

16. So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes,and, the tribe of Judah, was seized;

17. and he brought near the family of Judah, and, the family of the Zarhites, was seized,and he brought near the family of the Zarhites, man by man, and, Zabdi, was seized;

18. and he brought near his household, man by man,and, Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was seized.

19. And Joshua said unto AchanMy son give I pray thee glory unto Yahweh God of Israel and make to him confession,and tell me I pray thee what thou hast done, do not hide it from me.

20. And Achan answered Joshua and said,Of a truth, I, have sinned against Yahweh God of Israel, and, thus and thus, have I done:

21. When I saw among the spoil a certain goodly mantle of Babylonia and two hundred shekels of silver and a certain wedge of goldfifty shekels the weight thereof, then I coveted them, then I took them,and, there they are, hid in the earth, in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.

22. So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent,and, there it was, hid in his tent, and, the silver, under it.

23. And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them in unto Joshua, and unto all the sons of Israel,and poured them out before Yahweh.

24. And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achanson of Zerah, and the silver and the mantle and the wedge of gold, and his sons and his daughters, and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent, and all that he had, and brought them up the valley of Achor.

25. And Joshua saidWhy hast thou troubled us? Yahweh, will trouble thee, this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them up with fire, and covered them with stones;

26. yea they raised over him a great heap of stones

## Joshua 8

1. Then said Yahweh unto JoshuaDo not fear nor be dismayed, take with thee all the army, and arise, go up to Ai,see! I have given into thy hand, the king of Ai and his people, and his city, and his land;

2. so shalt thou do unto Ai and to her king, as thou didst unto Jericho unto her king, save only, the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof, shall ye take as your own prey,set thee an ambush for the city, behind it.

3. So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai,and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valour, and sent them forth by night.

4. And he commanded them, sayingSee! ye, shall be lying in ambush against the city, behind the city, do not go very far from the city,so shall ye all be ready.

5. But, I, and all the people who are with me, will draw near unto the city,and it shall be, when they come out to meet us, as at the first, then will we flee before them;

6. so will they come out after us, until we have drawn them away from the city, for they will say, Fleeing before us, as at the first! therefore will we flee before them.

7. Then, ye, shall rise up out of the ambush, and take possession of the city,and Yahweh your God will deliver it into your hand.

8. And it shall be, when ye have seized the city, then shall ye burn the city with fire, according to the word of Yahweh, shall ye do,see! I have commanded you.

9. So Joshua sent them forth, and they went into ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west of Ai,but Joshua lodged that night in the midst of the people.

10. And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and mustered the people,and went uphe and the elders of Israel, before the people, to Ai.

11. And, all the people of war who were with him, went up, and drew near, and came in, right before the city,and pitched on the north of Ai, with, a valley, between them and Ai.

12. And he took about five thousand men,and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west of the city.

13. And, when the people had set all the host that was on the north of the city, with the rear thereof on the west of the city, then went Joshua, during the night, into the midst of the valley.

14. And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted, and rose up early, and the men of the city came out to meet Israel for battle, he and all his people, at an appointed time, before the waste plain,he not knowing that there was an ambush lying in wait for him, behind the city.

15. So then Joshua and all Israel suffered themselves to be smitten before them,and fled, by the way of the wilderness;

16. and all the people who were in the city were called out to pursue them,and they pursued Joshua, and so were drawn out away from the city.

17. And there remained not a man, in Ai or Bethel, who had not gone out after Israel,and they left the city, open, and pursued Israel.

18. Then said Yahweh unto JoshuaStretch out with the javelin which is in thy hand, towards Ai, for, into thy hand, will I deliver it. So Joshua stretched out with the javelin which was in his hand, towards the city.

19. And, the ambush, rose up quickly, out of their place, and ran, when he stretched out his hand, and entered the city, and captured it,and hasted, and set the city on fire.

20. And the men of Ai turned behind them, and looked, and lo! the smoke of the city had risen up towards the heavens, and there was in them no strength, to flee this way or that way,moreover, the people that were fleeing to the wilderness, turned back upon the pursuers.

21. Yea, when, Joshua and all Israel, saw that the ambush had captured the city, and that the smoke of the city had risen up, then returned they, and smote the men of Ai.

22. And, the others, came forth out of the city to meet them, so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side,and they smote them, until there was left them none to remain or to escape.

23. And, the king of Ai, they caught alive,and brought him near unto Joshua.

24. And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness whither they had pursued them, and all of them had fallen by the edge of the sword until they were consumed, then all Israel returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.

25. And so it was, that all who fell that day, both of men and of women, were twelve thousand,all people of Ai.

26. Now, Joshua, drew not back his hand which he had stretched out with the javelin,until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.

27. Nevertheless, the cattle and the spoil of that city, Israel took as their own prey,according to the word of Yahweh, which he commanded Joshua.

28. So then Joshua burned Ai,and made of it an age-abiding heapa desolation,   until this day.

29. And, the king of Ai, hanged he on a tree until eventide,but, at the going in of the sun, Joshua gave command and they took down his dead body from the tree, and cast it in at the opening of the gate of the city, and raised up over it a great heap of stones

30. Than, built Joshua, an altar, unto Yahweh, God of Israel,in Mount Ebal:

31. as Moses, the servant of Yahweh, commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the scroll of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, whereon had not been wielded any tool of iron,and they caused to go up thereon, ascending-sacrifices unto Yahweh, and sacrificed peace-offerings.

32. Then wrote he there, upon the stones, a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the presence of the sons of Israel.

33. And, all Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, were standing on this side and on that side of the ark, before the priests the Levites, who were bearing the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, as well the sojourner as the home-born, half of them over against Mount Gerizim, and half of them over against Mount Ebal,as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded to bless the sons of Israel, first of all.

34. And, after that, read he all the words of the law, the blessing and the cursing,according to all that was written in the scroll of the law.

35. Them was not a word of all that Moses commanded,which Joshua read not before all the convocation of Israel, with the women and the little ones, and the sojourner who was going on in their midst.

## Joshua 9

1. And it came to pass, when they heard,namely, all the kings who were over the Jordan, in the hill country and in the lowland, and in all the coast of the great sea, over against the Lebanon,the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite;

2. then gathered they themselves together as one man, to fight with Joshua, and with Israel,with one accord.

3. Now, the inhabitants of Gibeon, heard that which Joshua had done unto Jericho and unto Ai;

4. they, however, acted craftily, and went and started,and took old sacks for their asses, and leathern wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;

5. and sandals, old and patched, upon their feet, and worn-out mantles upon them,and, all the bread of their provision, was dry and broken.

6. So they took their journey unto Joshua, unto the camp, at Gilgal,and said unto him, and unto the men of Israel, From a far country, are we come, Now, therefore, solemnise with us a covenant.

7. And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites,Peradventure, in our midst, ye are dwelling, how then can we solemnise with you a covenant?

8. And they said unto Joshua: Thy servants, we are. And Joshua said unto them: Who, are ye? And, from whence, come ye?

9. And they said unto himFrom a very far country, have thy servants come, because of the name of Yahweh thy God,because we had heard his fame, and all that he had done in Egypt;

10. and all that he had done unto the two kings of the Amorites who were over the Jordan,unto Sihon, king of Heshbon, and unto Og, king of Bashan, who was in Ashtaroth.

11. So our elders and all the inhabitants of our land spake unto us, sayingTake ye, in your hand, provision for the journey, and go your way to meet them,then shall ye say unto them, Your servants, we are. Now, therefore, solemnise with us a covenant.

12. This our bread, took we, hot, for our provision, out of our houses, on the day we came forth to journey unto you,but, now, lo! it is dry, yea it is broken;

13. and, these leathern wine bottles, which we filled new, lo! also, they are rent,and, as for these our mantles and our sandals, they are worn out, by reason of the very long journey.

14. So the men took of their provision,but, the bidding of Yahweh, had they not asked.

15. And Joshua made peace with them, and solemnised with them a covenant to let them live,and the princes of the assembly, entered into an oath with them.

16. And it came to pass, at the end of three days after they had solemnised with them a covenant, that they heard that, near neighbours, they were unto them, and, in their midst, they were dwelling.

17. So the sons of Israel brake up, and came in unto their cities on the third day,their cities, being Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.

18. And the sons of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the assembly had sworn unto them by Yahweh, God of Israel,but all the assembly murmured against the princes.

19. And all the princes said unto all the assembly, We, have sworn unto them, by Yahweh, God of Israel,now, therefore, we may not touch them.

20. This, will we do unto them, even let them live,lest there come on us wrath, because of the oath which we have sworn unto them.

21. And the princes said unto themLet them live. So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the assembly, as the princes spake unto them.

22. And Joshua called for them, and spake unto them, saying,Wherefore did ye deceive us, sayingWe are, very far, from you, whereas, ye, in our midst, are dwelling?

23. Now, therefore, accursed, ye are,and ye shall not cease to be in bond-service as hewers of wood and drawers of water, for the house of my God.

24. And they responded to Joshua, and saidBecause it was, plainly told, thy servants, how that Yahweh thy God had commanded Moses his servant to give unto you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you,therefore feared we greatly, for our lives, because of you, and did this thing.

25. Now, therefore, here we are, in thy hand,as may be good and right in thine eyes, to do unto us, do.

26. And he did to them so,and rescued them out of the hand of the sons of Israel, and they slew them not.

27. And Joshua appointed them that day to be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto the assembly,and unto the altar of Yahweh,

## Joshua 10

1. And it came to pass, when Adonizedec, king of Jerusalem, heard that Joshua had captured Ai, and devoted it to destruction, as he had done unto Jericho and her king, so, had he done unto Ai and her king,and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and had come into their midst,

2. then feared they greatly, because Gibeon was, a great city, as one of the royal cities,and because, it, was greater than Ai, and, all the men thereof, were mighty:

3. therefore sent Adonizedec, king of Jerusalem, unto Hoham, king of Hebron, and unto Piram, king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia, king of Lachish, and unto Debir, king of Eglon, saying:

4. Come up unto me and help me, that we may smite Gibeon,for it hath made peace with Joshua, and with the sons of Israel.

5. So they gathered themselves together and came up, even the five kings of the Amoritesthe king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon,they, and all their hosts,and encamped near Gibeon, and made war against it.

6. So the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua, unto the camp at Gilgal, saying, Do not withhold thy hand from thy servants,Come up unto us quickly, and save us, and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country, are gathered together against us.

7. So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, even all the mighty men of valour.

8. And Yahweh said unto Joshua: Do not fear because of them, for, into thy hand, have I delivered them,not a man of them shall stand before thee.

9. So then Joshua came in unto them, suddenly,all the night, came he up, from Gilgal.

10. And Yahweh confused them before Israel, and smote them with a great slaughter at Gibeon,and chased them along the way that goeth up Beth-horon, and smote them as far as Azekah and as far as Makkedah.

11. And it came to pass, when they fled from before Israel, they, being on the slope of Beth-horon, that, Yahweh, cast down upon them great stones out of the heavens, as far as Azekah, and they died,more, were they who died by the hailstones, than they whom the sons of Israel slew with the sword.

12. Then, spake Joshua unto Yahweh, on the day when Yahweh delivered up the Amorites before the sons of Israel,yea he said, in the presence of IsraelThou Sun! in Gibeon, be still, and thou Moon! in the vale of Aijalon.

13. So the sun, was still, and, the moon, stayed, until a nation should be avenged on its fees. Is not, that, written in the Book of the Upright? So then the sun stayed in the middle of the heavens, and hastened not to go in, about a whole day.

14. And there was no day like thatbefore it or after it, when Yahweh hearkened unto the voice of a man,in that, Yahweh, himself fought for Israel.

15. So Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp at Gilgal.

16. So these five kings fled,and hid themselves in a cave, at Makkedah.

17. And it was told Joshua, saying,The five kings are found, hid in a cave at Makkedah.

18. And Joshua said, Roll ye great stones against the mouth of the cave,and set over it men, to watch them;

19. but do not, ye, stay, chase after your enemies, so shall ye attack them in the rear,do not suffer them to enter into their cities, for Yahweh your God hath delivered them into your hand.

20. And it came to pass, when Joshua and the sons of Israel had made an end of smiting them with a very great slaughter, until they were spent, then did, the remainder that were left of them, enter into the fortified cities.

21. And all the people returned unto the camp, unto Joshua at Makkedah, in peace,none sharpened his tongue at any man of the sons of Israel.

22. Then said Joshua, Open ye the mouth of the cave,and bring out unto me, these five kings, out of the cave.

23. And they did so, and brought out unto him, these five kings, out of the cave,namely, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.

24. And it came to pass, when they brought out these kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war who had been with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. So they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.

25. Then said Joshua unto them: Do not fear, nor be alarmed,be firm and bold, for, thus and thus, will Yahweh do unto all your enemies, against whom ye do fight.

26. And Joshua smote them after this, and put them to death, and hanged them upon five trees,and they remained hung on the trees, until the evening,

27. And it came to pass, at the time of the going in of the sun, that Joshua gave command, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave, where they had hid themselves,and put great stones upon the mouth of the cave,

28. And Joshua captured, Makkedah, on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and, the king thereof, devoted he to destruction, them and all the souls that were therein, he left no survivor,but did unto the king of Makkedah, as he had done unto the king of Jericho.

29. And Joshua passed over, and all Israel with him, from Makkedah unto Libnah,and fought against Libnah;

30. and Yahweh delivered, it also, into the hand of Israel, with the king thereof, and he smote it with the edge of the sword, with all the souls that were therein, he left therein no survivor,but did unto the king thereof, as he had done unto the king of Jericho.

31. And Joshua passed over, and all Israel with him, from Libnah unto Lachish,and encamped against it, and fought against it;

32. and Yahweh delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he captured it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, with all the souls that were therein,according to all that he had done unto Libnah.

33. Then, came up Horam, king of Gezer, to help Lachish,and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had not left him a survivor.

34. And Joshua passed over, and all Israel with him, from Lachish unto Eglon,and they encamped against it, and fought against it;

35. and captured it on the same day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and, all the souls that were therein, on that day, devoted he to destruction,according to all that he had done to Lachish.

36. And Joshua went up, and all Israel with him, from Eglon unto Hebron,and they fought against it;

37. and captured it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, with all the souls that were thereinhe left not a survivor, according to all that he had done to Eglon,he devoted it to destruction, and all the souls that were therein.

38. Then Joshua turned back, and all Israel with him, unto Debir,and fought against it;

39. and captured it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and devoted to destruction every soul that was therein, he left not a survivor,as he had done unto Hebron, so, did he unto Debir, and unto the king thereof, as also he had done unto Libnah, and unto her king.

40. So Joshua smote all the landthe hill country, and the south, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings, he left not a survivor,but, every breathing thing, devoted he to destruction, as Yahweh, God of Israel, had commanded.

41. Yea Joshua smote them, from Kadesh-barnea, even as far as Gaza,and all the land of Goshen, even as far as Gibeon.

42. Yea, all these kings and their land, did Joshua capture at one time,because, Yahweh, God of Israel, fought for Israel.

43. And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp at Gilgal.

## Joshua 11

1. And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor heard, that he sent unto Jobab king of Madon, and unto the king of Shimron, and unto the king of Achshaph;

2. and unto the kings who were on the north in the hill country and in the waste plain south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland,and in the heights of Dor, on the west:

3. the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite and the Jebusite, in the hill country,and the Hivite, under Hermon, in the land of Mizpah;

4. and they came outthey, and all their hosts with them, much people, like the sand that is upon the seashore for multitude,with horses and chariots very many.

5. And, when all these kings were gathered together, they came in, and encamped as one man, at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.

6. Then said Yahweh unto JoshuaDo not fear because of them, for, to-morrow, about this time, am I going to deliver up all of them, slain, before Israel,their horses, shalt thou ham-string, and, their chariots, shalt thou burn up with fire.

7. So Joshua, and all the army with him, came in upon them, by the waters of Merom, suddenly, and fell upon them.

8. And Yahweh delivered them up into the hand of Israel, and they smote them, and chased them as far as great Zidon, and as far as Misrephoth-maim, and as far as the valley of Mizpeh, eastward,yea they smote them until they left them not a survivor.

9. And Joshua did unto them, as Yahweh had said unto him,their horses, he ham-strung, and, their chariots, burned he up with fire.

10. Then Joshua turned back, at that time, and captured Hazor, and, the king thereof, smote he with the sword,for, Hazor, aforetime, was the head of all these kingdoms.

11. And they smote all the souls that were therein, with the edge of the sword, devoting them to destruction, there was left no breathing thing,and, Hazor, burned he up with fire.

12. And, all the cities of these kings, and all the kings thereof, did Joshua capture, and he smote them with the edge of the sword, devoting them to destruction,as Moses, the servant of Yahweh, commanded.

13. Yet, none of the cities that were still standing upon their mound, did Israel burn, none but Hazor alone, did Joshua burn.

14. But, all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, did the sons of Israel take as their prey,nevertheless, all the human beings, smote they with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, they left remaining no breathing thing.

15. As Yahweh commanded Moses his servant, so, Moses commanded Joshua, and, so, Joshua, did, he set aside nothing of all that Yahweh commanded Moses.

16. So Joshua took all this landthe hill country, and all the south, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the waste plain,and the hill country of Israel, and the lowland thereof:

17. from Mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even as far as Baal-gad, in the valley of the Lebanon, under Mount Hermon,and, all their kings, he captured, and smote them, and put them to death.

18. Many days, did Joshua, with all these kings, make war.

19. There was not a city that made peace with the sons of Israel, save the Hivites dwelling in Gibeon,the whole, took they in battle.

20. For, from Yahweh, came it to pass, that their heart was emboldened to come out to war with Israel, that he might devote them to destruction, that they might find no favour,but that he might destroy them,as Yahweh commanded Moses.

21. And Joshua came in, at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill countryfrom Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel,with their cities, did Joshua devote them to destruction.

22. There was left remaining none of the Anakim, in the land of the sons of Israel,save only, in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain.

23. So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Yahweh had spoken unto Moses, and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel, according to their portions by their tribes,and, the land, had rest from war.

## Joshua 12

1. Now, these, are the kings of the land, whom the sons of Israel had smitten, and of whose land they had taken possession, over the Jordan, towards the rising of the sun,from the ravine of Arnon, as far as Mount Hermon, and all the waste plain, on the east:

2. Sihon, king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon,ruling from Aroer, which is on the edge of the ravine of Arnon, and the middle of the ravine, and half Gilead, even as far as the ravine Jabbok, the boundary of the sons of Ammon;

3. and the waste plain as far as the sea of Chinneroth, on the east, even as far as the sea of the waste plain, the salt sea, on the east, the way to Bethjeshimoth,and, on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah;

4. and the boundary of Og, king of Bashan, of the remnant of the giants,him who dwelt in Ashtaroth and in Edrei;

5. ruling also in Mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, as far as the boundary of the Geshurites, and the Maacathites,and half Gilead, the boundary of Sihon king of Heshbon:

6. Moses the servant of Yahweh, and the sons of Israel, had smitten them,and Moses the servant of Yahweh, had given it, as a possession, unto the Reubenites, and unto the Gadites, and unto the half tribe of Manasseh.

7. And, these, are the kings of the land, whom Joshua and the sons of Israel smote over the Jordan, towards the west, from Baal-gad in the valley of the Lebanon, even as far as the Mount Halak that goeth up towards Seir,and Joshua gave it unto the tribes of Israel, as a possession, according to their portions;

8. in the hill country and in the lowland, and in the waste plain, and in the slopes, and in the desert, and in the south,the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:

9. The king of Jericho, one, the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one,

10. The king of Jerusalem, one, the king of Hebron, one,

11. The king of Jarmuth, one, the king of Lachish, one,

12. The king of Eglon, one, the king of Gezer, one,

13. The king of Debir, one, the king of Geder, one,

14. The king of Hormah, one, the king of Arad, one,

15. The king of Libnah, one, the king of Adullam, one,

16. The king of Makkedah, one, the king of Bethel, one,

17. The king of Tappuah, one, the king of Hepher, one,

18. The king of Aphek, one, the king of Lassharon, one,

19. The king of Madon, one, the king of Hazor, one,

20. The king of Shimron-meron, one, the king of Achshaph, one,

21. The king of Taanach, one, the king of Megiddo, one,

22. The king of Kadesh, one, the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one,

23. The king of Dor, in the height of Dor, one, the king of Goim in Gilgal, one,

24. The king of Tirzah, one,All the kings, thirty and one.

## Joshua 13

1. Now, Joshua, was old, advanced in days,so then Yahweh said unto himThou, art old, advanced in days, and, much the larger part of the land, remaineth to be possessed.

2. This, is the land that remaineth,all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshuri;

3. from the Shihor which faceth Egypt, even as far as the boundary of Ekron, northward, to the Canaanites, is it counted,five princes of Philistines, the Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites, also the Avvim

4. on the south: all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah which belongeth to the Zidonians, as far as Aphek,as far as the boundary of the Amorites;

5. and the land of the Gebalites, and all the Lebanon, to the rising of the sun, from Baal-gad, under Mount Hermon,as far as the entering in of Hamath:

6. all the inhabitants of the hill country, from the Lebanon as far as Misrephoth-maimall the Zidonians, I myself, will dispossess them from before the sons of Israel,nevertheless, assign thou it by lot unto Israel, for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.

7. Now, therefore, apportion this land as an inheritance, unto the nine tribes,and the half tribe of Manasseh.

8. With them, the, Reubenites and the Gadites, received their inheritance,which Moses gave them beyond the Jordan, eastward, as Moses the servant of Yahweh gave unto them:

9. from Aroer, which is on the edge of the ravine of Arnon, and the city, which is in the midst of the ravine, and all the table-land of Medeba, as far as Dibon;

10. and all the cities of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon,as far as the boundary of the sons of Ammon;

11. and Gilead, and the boundary of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan, as far as Salecah;

12. all the kingdom of Og, in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei,he, being left of the remnant of the giants; and Moses smote them and dispossessed them;

13. the sons of Israel, however, did not dispossess, the Geshurites or the Maacathites,but Geshur and Maacath have remained in the midst of Israel until this day.

14. Howbeit, unto the tribe of Levi, gave he no inheritance,the altar-flames of Yahweh God of Israel, are his inheritance, as he spake unto him.

15. Thus then Moses gave   unto the tribe of the sons of Reuben by their families;

16. and their boundary was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the ravine of Arnon and the city which is in the midst of the ravine and all the table-land by Medeba;

17. Heshbon and all her cities which are on the table-land,Dibon and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon;

18. and Jahaz and Kedemoth and Maphaath;

19. and Kiriathaim and Sibmah, and Zareth-shahar on the mount of the vale;

20. and Beth-peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth;

21. and all the cities of the table-land, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon,whom Moses smotewith the princes of Midian, Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, dukes of Sihon dwelling in the land;

22. Balaam also son of Beor, the diviner, did the sons of Israel slay with the sword among their slain.

23. And so the boundary of the sons of Reuben was the Jordan and district. This, is the inheritance of the sons of Reuben by their families, the cities and the villages thereof.

24. And Moses gave   unto the tribe of Gad, unto the sons of Gad by their families;

25. and their boundary wasJazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the sons of Ammon,as far as Aroer, which faceth Rabbah;

26. and from Heshbon as far as Ramath-mizpeh, and Botonim,and from Mahanaim as far as the boundary of Debir;

27. and in the valleyBeth-haram and Beth-nimrah and Succoth and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, the Jordan and district,as far as the end of the sea of Chinnereth, beyond the Jordan eastward.

28. This, is the inheritance of the sons of Gad, by their families,the cities and the villages thereof.

29. And Moses gave   unto the half tribe of Manasseh,so it belonged to the half tribe of the sons of Manasseh by their families;

30. and their boundary wasfrom Mahanaim all Bashan all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan and all the Encampments of Jair which are in Bashan three-score cities;

31. and, half Gilead and Ashtaroth and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, pertained to the sons of Machir son of Manasseh, to half the sons of Machir by their families.

32. These, are   which Moses gave for inheritance, in the waste plains of Moab,over the Jordan by Jericho eastward.

33. But, unto the tribe of Levi, Moses gave no inheritance,Yahweh God of Israel, he, was their inheritance, as he spake unto them.

## Joshua 14

1. And, these, are the inheritances which the sons of Israel received in the land of Canaan,which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the ancestral heads of the tribes of the sons of Israel gave them to inherit.

2. By lot, was their inheritance divided,as Yahweh commanded by the hand of Moses, unto the nine tribes and unto the half tribe.

3. For Moses had given the two tribes and the half tribe their inheritance over the Jordan,but, unto the Levites, gave he no inheritance in their midst;

4. for the sons of Joseph became two tribes: Manasseh and Ephraim,so they gave no portion to the Levites in the land, save only cities to dwell in, with the pasture lands thereof, for their cattle and for their substance.

5. As Yahweh commanded Moses, so, did the sons of Israel,when they apportioned the land.

6. Then came near the sons of Judah unto Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, the Kenizzite, said unto him,Thou, knowest the word which Yahweh spake unto Moses the man of God in my behalf and in thine in Kadesh-barnea.

7. Forty years old, was I when Moses the servant of Yahweh sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land,so I brought him back word, as was in my heart.

8. But, my brethren who had been up with me, made the heart of the people melt,whereas, I, wholly followed Yahweh my God.

9. So then Moses sware on that day saying, Surely, the land on which thy foot hath trodden, unto thee, shall belong, for an inheritance, and unto thy sons, unto times age-abiding,because thou hast wholly followed Yahweh my God.

10. Now, therefore lo! Yahweh hath kept me alive as he spake these forty and five years from the time Yahweh spake this word unto Moses, while Israel journeyed in the desert. Now, therefore lo! Ito-day, am eighty and five years old:

11. I remain, to-day, as courageous as on the day when Moses sent me, as my strength was then, so also my strength is now,for war, both to go out and to come in.

12. Now, therefore, give me this mountain, whereof Yahweh spake, on that day,for, thou thyself, didst hear, on that day, that, Anakim, were there, and great cities fortified, if so be Yahweh be with me, then shall I dispossess them, as spake Yahweh.

13. So Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron unto Caleb son of Jephunneh, for an inheritance.

14. For this cause, hath Hebron belonged unto Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenezzite, for an inheritance, unto this day,because he wholly followed Yahweh, God of Israel.

15. Now, the name of Hebron, was formerly, City of Arba, the greatest man among the Anakim, was he. And, the land, had rest from war.

## Joshua 15

1. So then the boundary of the tribe of the sons of Judah, by their families,reached unto the boundary of Edom, the desert of Zin southward, on the extreme south;

2. so their south boundary beginneth at the end of the Salt Sea,from the bay that turneth to the south;

3. and goeth forth on the south of the cliffs of Akrabbim, and crosseth over to Zin, and goeth up on the south of Kadesh-barnea,and passeth over by Hezron, and goeth up to Addar, and turneth round to Karka;

4. and passeth over to Azmon, and goeth forth at the ravine of Egypt, and so the extensions of the boundary are to the sea. This, shall be your south boundary.

5. And, a boundary eastward, is the Salt Sea, as far as the end of the Jordan. And, the boundary on the north side, is from the bay of the sea, from the end of the Jordan.

6. And the boundary goeth up Beth-hoglah, and passeth over, on the north, by Beth-arabah,and the boundary goeth up by the Stone of Bohan, son of Reuben;

7. and the boundary goeth up towards Debir, out of the vale of Achor, then northward, turning unto Gilgal, which is over against the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the ravine,then the boundary passeth over unto the waters of En-shemesh, and so the extensions thereof are unto En-rogel:

8. then ascendeth the boundary by the valley of the son of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite, on the south, the same, is Jerusalem,and the boundary goeth up unto the top of the mountain which faceth the valley of Hinnom, to the west, which is at the end of the Vale of Giants, northwards;

9. and the boundary turneth round, from the top of the mountain, unto the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah, and goeth out unto the cities of Mount Ephron,then the boundary turneth round to Baalah, the same, is Kiriath-jearim;

10. then the boundary goeth round from Baalah westward, unto Mount Seir, and passeth over unto the slope of Mount Yearim, on the north, the same, is Chesalon,and descendeth Bethshemesh, and passeth over Timnah;

11. then the boundary goeth forth unto the side of Ekron, northward, then the boundary turneth round towards Shikkeron, and crosseth over Mount Baalah, and goeth out at Jabneel,and the extensions of the boundary are to the sea.

12. And, as a west boundary, are the great sea and coast. This, is the boundary of the sons of Judah, round about, by their families.

13. And, to Caleb, son of Jephunneh, gave he a portion, in the midst of the sons of Judah, at the bidding of Yahweh, by Joshua,even the City of Arba, father of Anak, the same, is Hebron.

14. And Caleb dispossessed from thence, the three sons of Anak,Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak.

15. And he went up from thence, against the inhabitants of Debir,now, the name of Debir, formerly, was Kiriath-sepher.

16. Then said Caleb, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and captureth it, I will give unto him Achsah, my daughter, to wife.

17. And Othniel son of Kenaz, brother of Caleb, captured it,so he gave unto him Achsah, his daughter, to wife.

18. And it came to pass, when she came, that she moved him to ask of her father a field, and, when she alighted from off the ass, Caleb said unto herWhat aileth thee?

19. And she saidGive me a present, for, dry land, hast thou given me, therefore must thou give me, pools of water. So he gave her upper pools and lower pools.

20. This, is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Judah, by their families.

## Joshua 16

1. Then came out the lot, for the sons of Joseph, from the Jordan by Jericho, at the waters of Jericho, eastward,the desert, going up from Jericho, through the hill country to Bethel;

2. and it goeth out from Bethel towards Luz,and passeth over unto the boundary of the Archites at Ataroth;

3. and descendeth westward, unto the boundary of the Japhletites, as far as the boundary of Bethhoron the nether, and as far as Gezer,and the extensions thereof are to the sea.

4. So the sons of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their inheritance.

5. And the boundary of the sons of Ephraim, by their families, was,yea the boundary of their inheritance on the east, was Ataroth-addar, as far as Beth-horon the upper;

6. and the boundary goeth out westward at Michmethath, on the north, then the boundary bendeth round easward, to Taanath-shiloh,and passeth by it on the east to Janoah;

7. and goeth down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah,and toucheth upon Jericho, and goeth out at the Jordan.

8. From Tappuah, runneth the boundary along westward, to the ravine of Kanah, and the extensions thereof are to the sea,this, is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim, by their families;

9. together with the cities which were separated for the sons of Ephraim, in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh,all the cities, with their villages.

10. But they did not dispossess the Canaanites who were dwelling in Gazer,so the Canaanites have dwelt in the midst of Ephraim unto this day, and have become tributary servants.

## Joshua 17

1. And the lot for the tribe of Manasseh was, for, he, was the firstborn of Joseph,as for Machir, the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because, he, was a man of war, therefore had he Gilead and Bashan.

2. So the lot pertained to the rest of the sons of Manasseh, by their families, to the sons of Abiezer, and to the sons of Helek, and to the sons of Asriel, and to the sons of Shechem, and to the sons of Hepher, and to the sons of Shemida,these, were the sons of Manasseh, son of Joseph, even the male descendants, by their families.

3. But, Zelophehad, son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, had no sons, but only daughters,and, these, are the names of his daughters, Mahlah and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

4. And they had come near, before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, Yahweh, commanded Moses, to give us an inheritance in the midst of our brethren,And he had given them, according to the bidding of Yahweh, an inheritance, in the midst of the brethren of their father.

5. Thus there fell ten portions to Manasseh,besides the land of Gilead, and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan;

6. because, the daughters of Manasseh, received an inheritance in the midst of his sons,and, the land of Gilead, became the possession of the sons of Manasseh that remained.

7. So then the boundary of Manasseh was from Asher, Michmethath, which faceth Shechem,and the boundary goeth along unto the right hand, unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah.

8. Manasseh, had the land of Tappuah,but, Tappuah itself, towards the boundary of Manasseh, pertained unto the sons of Ephraim;

9. and the boundary goeth down to the ravine of Kanah, southward of the ravine, these cities, belong to Ephraim, in the midst of the cities of Manasseh,but, the boundary of Manasseh, was on the north side of the ravine, and the extensions thereof were to the sea;

10. southward, pertaineth to Ephraim, and, northward, to Manasseh, and the sea was the boundary thereof,and they touch, Asher, on the north, and Issachar on the east.

11. And Manasseh hadin Issachar and in AsherBethshean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo, and her townsthe three heights,

12. The sons of Manasseh, however, could not dispossess these cities,but the Canaanites were determined to remain in this land;

13. but, when the sons of Israel had waxed strong, they put the Canaanites under tribute,though they, dispossessed, them not.

14. Then spake the sons of Joseph unto Joshua, saying,Why hast thou given me, as an inheritance, but one lot and one portion, seeing that, I, am a numerous people, because hitherto hath Yahweh blessed me.

15. And Joshua said unto them: If, a numerous people, thou art, get thee up to the forest, and cut down for thyself there, in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim,seeing that, too narrow for thee, is the hill country of Ephraim.

16. And the sons of Joseph said, The hill country is not enough for us,and there are, chariots of iron, among all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley, belonging both to them in Bethshean, and her towns, and to them in the valley of Jezreel.

17. And Joshua made answer unto the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying,A numerous people, thou art, and, great vigour, thou hast, thou shalt not have one lot only;

18. for, the hill country, shall be thine, in that, a forest, it is, therefore canst thou cut it down, and thine shall be the extensions thereof,for thou shalt dispossess the Canaanites, though, chariots of iron, they have, and though, strong, they are.

## Joshua 18

1. Then were gathered together all the assembly of the sons of Israel at Shiloh, and they set up there, the tent of meeting,the land, having been subdued before them.

2. But there remained among the sons of Israel, to whom had not been apportioned their inheritance,seven tribes.

3. So Joshua said unto the sons of Israel,How long, will ye be too slothful, to enter in and take possession of the land, which Yahweh God of your fathers, hath given unto you?

4. Set forth for you three men for each tribe,that I may send them, that they may ariseand go up and down in the landand map it out as required for their inheritance, and come in unto me.

5. So shall they apportion it for themselves into seven parts,Let, Judah, stay upon his boundary, on the south, and, the house of Joseph, stay upon their boundary, on the north,

6. but, ye, shall map out the   unto me, here,then will I cast lots for you here, before Yahweh our God.

7. For Levi hath no portion in your midst, for, the priesthood of Yahweh, is his inheritance,and, Gad, and Reuben, and the half tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance, beyond the Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave unto them.

8. So the men arose, and went,and Joshua commanded them who were going, to map out the land, sayingTake your journey and go up and down in the land, and map it out, and return unto me, and, here, will I cast lots for you before Yahweh, in Shiloh.

9. So the men went, and passed through the land, and mapped it out by cities, into seven parts, upon a scroll,and came in unto Joshua, unto the camp, in Shiloh.

10. And Joshua cast for them lots, in Shiloh, before Yahweh,and Joshua there apportioned the land unto the sons of Israel, according to their portions.

11. Then came up the lot of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin, by their families,and the boundary of their lot came out, between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph.

12. And so their boundary, on the north border, was from the Jordan,and the boundary goeth up unto the side of Jericho on the north, and goeth up in the hill country, westward, and the extensions thereof are towards the wilderness of Beth-aven;

13. and the boundary passeth over from thence towards Luz, to the side of Luz, southwards, the same, is Bethel,and the boundary goeth down to Ataroth-addah, by the mountain that is on the south of Beth-horon the nether;

14. then turneth the boundary and goeth round the west border, southward, from the mountain which faceth Beth-horon, southward, and so the extensions thereof are unto Kiriath-baalthe same, is Kiriath-jearim, a city of the sons of Judah,this, is the west border.

15. And, the border southward, is from the uttermost part of Kiriath-jearim,and the boundary goeth out westward, yea it goeth out unto the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah;

16. and the boundary goeth down to the uttermost part of the mountain which faceth the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the Vale of Giants, northward,and descendeth the valley of Hinnom, unto the side of the Jebusite, southward, and then descendeth to En-rogel;

17. and it turneth on the north, and goeth out at En-shemesh, and goeth out unto Geliloth, which is over against the ascent of Adummim,and goeth down by the Stone of Bohan, son of Reuben;

18. and passeth along unto the side over against the Arabah, northward,and goeth down toward the Arabah;

19. and the boundary passeth along unto the side of Beth-hoglah, northward, and so the extensions of the boundary are unto the bay of the Salt Sea, northward, unto the end of the Jordan, southward,This, is the south boundary.

20. And, the Jordan itself, boundeth it as an eastward border. This, is the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, by the boundaries thereof round about, by their families.

21. So then the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin, by their families, are,Jericho and Beth-hoglah, and Emekkeziz,

22. and Beth-arabah and Zemaraim, and Bethel,

23. and Avvim and Parah and Ophrah,

24. and Chephar-ammoni and Ophni, and Geba,twelve cities, with their villages:

25. Gibeon and Ramah, and Beeroth,

26. and Mizpeh and Chephirah, and Mozah,

27. and Rekem and Irpeel, and Taralah,

28. and Zelah, Eleph, and the Jebusite, the same, is Jerusalem, Gibeath

## Joshua 19

1. And the second lot came out, for Simeon, for the tribe of the sons of Simeon, by their families,and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Judah.

2. And they had for their inheritance,Beer-sheba or Sheba, and Moladah,

7. Ain, Rimmon, and Ether and Ashan,four cities, with their villages,

8. and all the villages that were round about these cities, as far as Baalath-beer, Ramah of the South. This, is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Simeon, by their families:

9. Out of the portion of the sons of Judah, is the inheritance of the sons of Simeon,for it came to pass that what was allotted to the sons of Judah, was too much for them, therefore did the sons of Simeon receive an inheritance in the midst of their inheritance.

10. Then came up the third lot, for the sons of Zebulun, by their families,and the boundary of their inheritance was as far as Sarid.

11. And their boundary goeth up westward, even towards Maralah, and toucheth Dabbesheth,and reacheth unto the ravine that faceth Jokneam;

12. and turneth back from Sarid, eastward, toward the rising of the sun, upon the boundary of Chisloth-tabor,and goeth out unto Daberath, and ascendeth Japhia;

13. and, from thence, it passed along in front on the east, towards Gath-hepher, towards Eth-kazin,and goeth out at Rimmon which turneth about towards Neah;

14. and the boundary goeth round it, on the north to Hannathon,and so the extensions thereof are the valley of Iphtah-el;

15. and Kattath and Nahalal, and Shimron, and Idalah and Beth-lehem,twelve cities, with their villages.

16. This, is the inheritance of the sons of Zebulun, by their families,these cities, with their villages.

17. For Issachar, came out the fourth lot,for the sons of Issachar, by their families.

18. And their boundary was,Jezreel and Chesulloth, and Shunem,

19. and Hapharaim and Shion, and Anaharath,

20. and Rabbith and Kishion, and Ebez,

21. and Remeth, and En-gannim, and Enhaddah, and Beth-pazzez;

22. and the boundary toucheth Tabor and Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh, and so the extensions of their boundary are to the Jordan,sixteen cities, with their villages.

23. This, is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Issachar, by their families,the cities, with their villages.

24. Then came out the fifth lot, for the tribe of the sons of Asher, by their families.

25. And their boundary was,Helkath and Hali, and Beten and Achshaph,

26. and Allam-melech and Amad, and Mishal,and it toucheth Carmel to the west, and Shihor-libnath;

27. and it turneth toward sun-riseto Beth-dagon, and toucheth Zebulun and the valley of Iphtah-el northward, and Beth-emek, and Neiel; and goeth out unto Cabul, on the left,

28. and Ebron and Rehob, and Hammon and Kanah,as far as Zidon the populous;

29. and the boundary turneth to Ramah, and as far as the city of the fortress of Tyre,then the boundary turneth to Hosah, and so the extensions thereof are, on the west, from Hebel to Achzib;

30. Ummah also and Aphek, and Rehob,twenty-two cities, with their villages,

31. This, is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Asher, by their families,these cities, with their villages.

32. For the sons of Naphtali, came out the sixth lot,for the sons of Naphtali, by their families.

33. And their boundary was from Heleph, from the terebinth of Bezaannim, and Adami-nekeb, and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum; and so the extensions thereof were to the Jordan;

34. and the boundary turneth westward, to Aznoth-tabor, and goeth out from thence, toward Hukkok,and toucheth Zebulun on the south, and, Asher, it toucheth on the west, and Judah, at the Jordan towards sunrise.

35. And, the fortified cities, are,Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath and Chinnereth,

36. and Adamah and Ramah, and Hazor,

37. and Kedesh and Edrei, and En-hazor,

38. and Iron and Migdal-el, Horem and Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh,nineteen cities, with their villages.

44. and Eltekeh and Gibbethon, and Baalath,

45. and Jehud and Beneberak, and Gath-rimmon,

46. and Me-jarkon, and Rakkon,with the boundary over against Joppa.

47. And, when the boundary of the sons of Dan went out beyond these, then went up the sons of Dan and fought against Leshem, and captured it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and took possession thereof, and dwelt therein, and they called LeshemDan, after the name of Dan their father,

48. This, is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Dan, by their families,these cities, with their villages.

49. When they had made an end of distributing the land by the boundaries thereof, then gave the sons of Israel an inheritance unto Joshua son of Nun, in their midst:

50. at the bidding of Yahweh, gave they unto him the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah, in the hill country of Ephraim,and he built the city and dwelt therein.

51. These, are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun and the ancestral heads distributed for inheritance to the tribes of the sons of Israel, by lot, in Shiloh, before Yahweh, at the entrance of the tent of meeting,so they made an end of apportioning the land.

## Joshua 20

1. And Yahweh spake unto Joshua, saying:

2. Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying,Set out for you the cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you, by the hand of Moses:

3. that the manslayer who slayeth a person by mistake, unwittingly, may flee thither,so shall they be unto you for refuge from the blood-redeemer,

4. and he shall flee unto one of these cities and present himself at the entrance of the gate of the city, and shall speak, in the ears of the elders of that city, his defence,and they shall take him for protection into the city unto them, and shall give him a place, so shall he dwell with them.

5. And, when the blood-redeemer pursueth after him, then shall they not deliver up the manslayer, into his hand,because, unwittingly, it was that he slew his neighbour, and had not been, cherishing hatred, towards him, aforetime;

6. so shall he remain in that city, until he standeth before the assembly, for judgment, until the death of the high-priest who shall be in those days,then, shall the manslayer return, and enter into his own city, and into his own house, within the city from whence he fled.

7. So then they set apart Kadesh in Galilee, in the hill country of Naphtali, and Shechem, in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba, the same, is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah.

8. And, beyond the Jordan, by Jericho eastward, they appointed Bezer in the wilderness, in the table-land, out of the tribe of Reuben,and Ramoth in Gilead, out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan, out of the tribe of Manasseh.

9. These, were the cities appointed for all the sons of Israel, and for the sojourner who sojourneth in their midst, that whosoever should slay a person by mistake, might flee thither,and not die by the hand of the blood-redeemer, until he should stand before the assembly.

## Joshua 21

1. Then came near the ancestral heads of the Levites, unto Eleazar, the priest, and unto Joshua son of Nun,and unto the ancestral heads of the tribes, of the sons of Israel;

2. and spake unto them in Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying: Yahweh himself, commanded, by the hand of Moses, that there should be given unto us cities to dwell in,with their pasture-lands for our cattle.

3. So the sons of Israel gave unto the Levites, out of their own inheritance, at the bidding of Yahweh,these cities, with their pasture-lands.

4. And, when the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites, then had the sons of Aaron the priest, from among the Levitesout of the tribe of Judah and out of the tribe of the Simeonites and out of the tribe of Benjaminby lot, thirteen cities.

5. And, the sons of Kohath that remained, hadout of the families of the tribe of Ephraim and out of the tribe of Dan and out of the half tribe of Manassehby lot, ten cities.

6. And, the sons of Gershon, hadout of families of the tribe of Issachar and out of the tribe of Asher and out of the tribe of Naphtali and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashanby lot, thirteen cities.

7. The sons of Merari, by their families, hadout of the tribe of Reuben and out of the tribe of Gad and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.

8. So the sons of Israel gave unto the Levites these cities, with their pasture lands,as Yahweh commanded, by the hand of Moses, by lot.

9. Thus then they gaveout of the tribe of the sons of Judah and out of the tribe of the sons of Simeonthese cities which are mentioned by name.

10. And the sons of Aaron, from among the sons of Kohath, from among the sons of Levi, had them,because, theirs, was the first lot;

11. yea there was given unto them, the city of Arba, the father of Anak, the same, is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah,with the pasture land thereof, round about it;

12. whereas, the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they unto Caleb son of Jephunneh, as his possession.

13. But, unto the sons of Aaron the priest, gave they the city of refuge for the manslayer, even Hebron, with the pasture lands thereof,Libnah also, with her pasture lands;

14. and Jattir with her pasture land, and Eshtemoa with her pasture land;

15. and Holon, with her pasture land, and Debir, with her pasture land;

16. and Ain, with her pasture land, and Juttah, with her pasture land, Beth-shemesh, with her pasture land,nine cities, out of these two tribes.

18. Anathoth, with her pasture land, and Almon, with her pasture land,four cities.

19. All the cities of the sons of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities, with their pasture lands.

20. And, as for the families of the sons of Kohath, the Levites, which remained of the sons of Kohath, the cities of their lot were out of the tribe of Ephraim.

21. So they gave unto them a city of refuge for the manslayer, even Shechem with her pasture land, in the hill country of Ephraim,also Gezer, with her pasture land;

22. and Kibzaim, with her pasture land, and Beth-horon, with her pasture land,four cities.

26. All the cities, were ten, with their pasture lands: for the families of the sons of Kohath which remained.

27. And, the sons of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, had, out of the half tribe of Manasseh, a city of refuge for the manslayer, even Golan in Bashan, with her pasture land, and Be-eshterah, with her pasture land,two cities.

28. And, out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishion, with her pasture land,Daberath, with her pasture land;

32. And, out of the tribe of Naphtali, a city of refuge for the manslayereven Kedesh in Galilee, with her pasture land, and Hammoth-dor, with her pasture land, and Kartan, with her pasture land,three cities.

33. All, the cities of the Gershonites, by their families, were thirteen cities, with their pasture lands.

34. And, unto the families of the sons of Merari, the Levites that remained, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam, with her pasture land,Kartah, with her pasture land;

35. Dimnah, with her pasture land, Nahalal, with her pasture land,four cities.

36. And, out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer, with her pasture land,and Jahaz, with her pasture land;

37. Kedemoth, with her pasture land and Mephaath, with her pasture land,four cities.

38. And, out of the tribe of Gad, a city of refuge for the manslayereven Ramoth in Gilead, with her pasture land,and Mahanaim, with her pasture land;

39. Heshbon, with her pasture land, Jazer, with her pasture land,in all, four cities.

40. All the cities for the sons of Merari, by their families, who remained of the families of the Levites, yea their lot was, twelve, cities.

41. All the cities of the Levites, in the midst of the possession of the sons of Israel, were forty-eight cities, with their pasture lands:

42. these cities passed, each severally, with its pasture lands round about it; thus, was it with all these cities.

43. So Yahweh gave unto Israel, all the land which he had sworn to give unto their fathers,and they took possession thereof, and dwelt therein.

44. And Yahweh gave them rest round about, according to all that he had sworn unto their fathers,and there stood not a man before them, of all their enemies; all their enemies, did Yahweh deliver into their hand.

45. There failed not a thing, out of all the good things, whereof Yahweh had spoken unto the house of Israel,the whole, came to pass.

## Joshua 22

1. Then, called Joshuafor the Reubenites, and for the Gadites,and for the half tribe of Manasseh;

2. and said unto them, Ye, have observed all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you,and have hearkened unto my voice, in all that I commanded you:

3. ye have not forsaken your brethren, these many days, unto this day,but have kept the charge of the commandment of Yahweh your God.

4. Now, therefore, that Yahweh your God hath given rest unto your brethren, according as he spake unto them,now, therefore, turn ye and get you to your homes within the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave unto you, over the Jordan.

5. Only, take ye diligent heed, to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded youto love Yahweh your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him,and to serve himwith all your heart, and with all your soul.

6. So Joshua blessed them,and sent them away, and they took their journey unto their homes.

7. Now, unto the   half, did Joshua give possession with their brethren, over the Jordan, westward,moreover also, when Joshua sent them away unto their homes, he blessed them,

8. and spake unto them, sayingWith much wealth, return ye unto your homes, even with very much cattle, with silver and with gold, and with copper and with iron, and with very much raiment,divide ye the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.

9. So the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh. returned and departed from the sons of Israel, from Shiloh, which was in the land of Canaan,to go unto the land of Gilead, unto the land of their possession, wherein they had received their possessions, at the bidding of Yahweh by the hand of Moses.

10. And, when they came into the circles of the Jordan, which were in the land of Canaan,then did the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh build there an altar by the Jordan, an altar of large dimensions,

11. And the sons of Israel heard say,Lo! the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in front of the land of Canaan, in the circles of the Jordan, in the region opposite the sons of Israel.

12. And, when the sons of Israel heard, all the assembly of the sons of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war.

13. And the sons of Israel sent unto the sons of Reuben and unto the sons of Gad and unto the half tribe of Manasseh, within the land of Gilead,Phinehas, son of Eleazar the priest;

14. and ten princes with him, one prince of an ancestral house for each of the tribes of Israel,they being, severally heads of their ancestral houses, among the thousands of Israel.

15. So they came in unto the sons of Reuben and unto the sons of Gad and unto the half tribe of Manasseh, within the land of Gilead,and spake with them, saying:

16. Thus, say all the assembly of YahwehWhat is this act of treachery which ye have committed against the God of Israel, that ye should turn back, to-day, from following Yahweh,in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel, to-day, against Yahweh?

17. Too little for us, was the iniquity of Peor, from which we have not cleansed ourselves, unto this day,although the plague came upon the assembly of Yahweh;

18. but that, ye, must turn back to-day from following Yahweh,though it must needs be that, if, ye, rebel to-day against Yahweh, then, to-morrow, with all the assembly of Israel, will he be wroth?

19. Howbeit, if, unclean, be the land of your possession, do ye on your part come over into the land of the possession of Yahweh, where abideth the habitation of Yahweh, and take your possession in our midst,but, against Yahweh, do not rebel, nor, against us, rebel, by building yourselves an altar apart from the altar of Yahweh our God.

20. Did not, Achan son of Zerah, commit an act of treachery, with a devoted thing, and, upon all the assembly of Israel, came wrath,so that not, heone man alone, died in his iniquity.

21. Then responded the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh,and spake unto the heads of the thousands of Israel:

22. El-Elohim-Yahweh, El-Elohim-Yahweh, he knoweth, and, Israel, he, shall know,if in rebellion, or if in treachery, against Yahweh, do not save us this day:

23. that we should build for ourselves an altar, to turn back from following Yahweh,or, if that we might cause to go up thereon ascending-sacrifice or meal-offering, or if that we might offer thereon peace-offerings, let Yahweh himself require it;

24. if, indeed, we have not, rather, out of anxiety and of purpose, done this thing, saying,. In time to come, your sons might speak to our sons, saying, What have ye to do with Yahweh, God of Israel;

25. seeing that, a boundary, hath Yahweh put between us and you, ye sons of Reuben and ye sons of Gadeven the Jordan, ye have no portion in Yahweh,so might your sons cause our sons, to cease from revering Yahweh.

26. We said, therefore, Let us prepare, we pray you, to build us an altar,not for ascending-offering, nor for sacrifice;

27. but that, a witness, it may be between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we are to do the service of Yahweh, before him, with our ascending-offerings and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings,that your sons may not say, in time to come, to our sons, Ye have no portion in Yahweh.

28. Therefore said we, And it shall be, when they   say to us, or to our generations, in time to come,that we will sayBehold ye the pattern of the altar of Yahweh, which our fathers made, not for ascending-offerings nor for sacrifice, but that, a witness, it might be between us and you.

29. Far be it from usthat we should rebel against Yahweh, or turn back, to-day, from following Yahweh, by building an altar, for ascending-offering, or meal-offering or for sacrifice,other than the altar of Yahweh our God, which is before his habitation.

30. And, when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the assembly, even the heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him, heard the words which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Manasseh spake, then was it well-pleasing in their eyes.

31. And Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest said unto the sons of Reuben and unto the sons of Gad and unto the sons of ManassehTo-day, we know that, in our midst, is Yahweh, in that ye have not committed, against Yahweh, this act of treachery,now, have ye rescued the sons of Israel out of the hand of Yahweh.

32. So Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest and the princes returned from the sons of Reuben and from the sons of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, unto the sons of Israel,and brought them back word.

33. And the thing was well-pleasing in the eyes of the sons of Israel, and the sons of Israel blessed God,and spake not of going up against them, to war, to lay waste the land, wherein the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad dwelt.

34. So the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad named the altar

## Joshua 23

1. And it came to pass, after many days, when Yahweh had given rest unto Israel, from all their enemies round about,and, Joshua, had become old, advanced in days,

2. that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers,and said unto them, I, am old, advanced in days;

3. but, ye, have seenall that Yahweh your God hath done unto all those nations, because of you,for, Yahweh your God, is he that hath fought for you.

4. Behold, I have allotted to you these nations which remain, as an inheritance, for your tribes,from the Jordan, and all the nations which I have cut off, even unto the great sea, at the going in of the sun.

5. But, Yahweh your Godhe, will thrust them out from before you, and drive them away out of your sight,so shall ye possess their land, as Yahweh your God spoke unto you.

6. Therefore must ye be very firm to observe and to do all that is written in the scroll of the law of Moses,so as not to turn aside therefrom, to the right hand or to the left;

7. so as not to go in among these nations, these which remain with you,and, with the name of their gods, shall ye neither make memorial nor put on oath, and neither serve them,nor bow down to them.

8. But, unto Yahweh your God, must ye cleave,as, ye have done until this day;

9. therefore hath Yahweh dispossessed, from before you, nations great and strong,but, as for you, not a man hath stood before you, until this day.

10. One man of you, can chase a thousand,for, Yahweh your God, is he that fighteth for you, as he spake to you.

11. Take diligent heed, therefore, unto your souls,to love Yahweh your God.

12. But, if ye, do in any wise turn back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, these which remain with you,and intermarry with them, and go in with them, and, they, with you;

13. know, that Yahweh your God will no further drive out these nations from before you,but they will become unto you a snare and a hook, and a goad in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye have perished from off this goodly soil, which Yahweh your God hath given unto you.

14. But lo! I am going to-day, in the way of all the earth,ye must acknowledge, therefore, with all your heart and with all your soul, that there hath not failed a single thing, out of all the good things which Yahweh your God spake concerning you, the whole, hath come to pass to you, there hath not failed thereof, a single thing.

15. But it shall be that, as all the good things have come unto you, which Yahweh your God spake unto you, so, will Yahweh bring upon you all the evil things, until he hath destroyed you from off this goodly soil, which Yahweh your God hath given unto you.

16. When ye transgress the covenant of Yahweh your God which he hath commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and bow yourselves down unto them, then will the anger of Yahweh kindle upon you, and ye will perish quickly, from off the good land which he hath given unto you.

## Joshua 24

1. And Joshua gathered together all the tribes of Israel, unto Shechem,and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and they presented themselves before God.

2. Then said Joshua unto all the peopleThus, saith Yahweh, God of Israel, Beyond the River, dwelt your fathers from age-past times,   Terah, father of Abraham, and father of Nahor,and they served other gods.

3. So I took your father, Abraham, from beyond the River, and led him through all the land of Canaan,and multiplied his seed, and gave unto him, Isaac;

4. and gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau,and gave unto Esau, Mount Seir, to possess it, but, Jacob and his sons, went down into Egypt.

5. Then sent I Moses and Aaron, and plagued Egypt, according to that which I did in their midst, and, afterwards, brought you forth.

6. Yea I brought forth your fathers, out of Egypt, and ye came unto the sea, and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers, with chariots and with horsemen, unto the Red Sea.

7. So they made outcry unto Yahweh, and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought in upon them the sea, and covered them,and your eyes beheld what I did with the Egyptians. And, when ye had remained in the desert many days,

8. then I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who were dwelling over the Jordan, and they fought with you,then delivered I them into your hand, and ye took possession of their land, so I destroyed them from before you.

9. Then rose up Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab, and made war with Israel,and sent and called for Balaam son of Beor, to curse you;

10. but I was not willing to hearken unto Balaam,so, he kept on blessing, you, and I rescued you out of his hand.

11. Then passed ye over the Jordan, and came in unto Jericho, and, when they would have made war with youeven the lords of Jerichothe Amorite and the Perizzite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Girgashite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, then delivered I them into your hand.

12. And I sent before you the hornet, which drave them out from before you, the two kings of the Amorites,not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.

13. Thus I gave unto you a land on which thou hadst not laboured, and cities which ye had not built, and ye proceeded to dwell therein,of vineyards and oliveyards, which ye planted not, ye are eating.

14. Now, therefore, revere ye Yahweh, and serve him, in sincerity and in truth,and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt, and serve ye Yahweh.

15. But, if it be, a vexation, in your eyes, to serve Yahweh, choose ye for yourselves, to-day, whom ye will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served, that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye are dwelling,but, I and my house, will serve Yahweh.

16. Then responded the people, and said, Far be it from us, that we should forsake Yahweh,to serve other gods;

17. for, as for Yahweh our God, he, brought up both us and our fathers, out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants,and who did before our eyes, these great signs, and preserved us throughout all the way wherein we journeyed, and among all the peoples through the midst of whom we passed;

18. then did Yahweh drive out all the peoples, even the Amorites were dwelling in the land, from before us,we too, will serve Yahweh, for, he, is our God.

19. Then said Joshua unto the peopleYe cannot serve Yahweh, for, a holy God, he is, a jealous GOD, he is, he will not forgive your transgression, nor your sins.

20. When ye forsake Yahweh, and serve the gods of a stranger, then will he turn, and inflict on you calamity, and consume you, after that he hath dealt well with you.

21. But the people said unto Joshua,Nay! but, Yahweh, will we serve.

22. Then said Joshua unto the peopleWitnesses, are ye, against yourselves, that, ye yourselves, have chosen you Yahweh, to serve him. And they said: Witnesses!

23. Now, therefore, put ye away the gods of the stranger, that are in your midst,and incline your heart unto Yahweh, God of Israel.

24. And the people said unto Joshua,Yahweh our God, will we serve, and, unto his voice, will we hearken.

25. So then Joshua solemnised a covenant for the people, on that day,and set for them a statute and a regulation, in Shechem.

26. And Joshua wrote these words in the scroll of the law of God,and took a great stone, and set it up there, under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh.

27. And Joshua said unto all the peopleLo! this stone, shall serve against us as a witness, for, it, hath heard all the sayings of Yahweh, which he hath spoken with us,so shall it serve against you as a witness, lest ye should act deceptively against your God.

28. And Joshua sent the people away, every man unto his inheritance.

29. And it came to pass, after these things, that Joshua son of Nun, servant of Yahweh, died, being a hundred and ten years old.

30. And they buried him within the bounds of his own inheritance, in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of Mount Gaash.

31. So then Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua,and all the days of the elders who prolonged their days after Joshua, and who had known all the work of Yahweh, which he had wrought for Israel.

32. And, the bones of Josephwhich the sons of Israel had brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in the portion of field, which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of money,and they belonged unto the sons of Joseph, as an inheritance.

33. And, Eleazar son of Aaron, died,and they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given to him, in the hill country of Ephraim.
