# Obadiah

## Obadiah 1

__They who swear by the Guilt of Samaria, and say, As thy God, liveth, O Dan! and, As the Way of Beer-sheba, liveth, shall fall, and shall not rise any more.__

1. The vision of Obadiah,Thus, saith My Lord, Yahweh, concerning EdomA rumour, have we heard from Yahweh, and, a herald, throughout the nations, hath been sent, Up! and let us rise against her to war.

2. Lo! small, have I made thee, among the nationsDespised art thou exceedingly!

3. The insolence of thy heart, hath deceived thee, O thou that inhabitest the retreats of the crag, the height of his habitation,that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?

4. Though thou build high like an eagle, and though, among the stars, thou set thy nest, from thence, will I bring thee down, Declareth Yahweh.

5. If, thieves, had come to thee, if robbers by nighthow ruined thou art! Would they not have stolen what sufficed them? If, grape-gatherers, had come to thee, Would they not have left gleanings?

6. How have the things of Esau been searched out! his treasures been sought up!

7. Up to the boundary, have they sent theeAll thy covenant men, they have deceived thee, prevailed against theethe men thou wast wont to salute,The partakers of thy bread, have put a net under theeNo understanding in him!

8. Shall it not be, in that day, Demandeth Yahweh,That I will destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of Mount Esau?

9. So shall thy mighty men, O Teman, be dismayed,to the intent that every man, may be cut off, out of Mount Esau, by slaughter.

10. For thy violence against thy brother Jacob, shall shame, cover thee,so shalt thou be cut off, to times age-abiding.

11. In the day when thou didst take thy stand over against him, in the day when foreigners took captive his forces,and, aliens, entered his gates, and, over Jerusalem, cast lots, even thou, wast like one of them!

12. Do not, then, look with satisfaction upon the day of thy brother, upon the day of his calamity, Neither rejoice over the sons of Judahin the day of their ruin,nor enlarge thy mouthin the day of distress:

13. Do not enter into the gate of my peoplein the day of their misfortune, Do not, thou also, look with satisfaction on his miseryin the day of his misfortune; neither do thou thrust   on his substancein the day of his misfortune;

14. Neither do thou stand at the parting of the way, to cut off his fugitives,neither do thou deliver up his survivorsin the day of distress.

15. For, near, is the day of Yahweh, upon all the nations,Just as thou hast done, shall it be done to thee, Thy dealing, shall come back upon thine own head.

16. For, as ye have drunk on my holy mountain, all the nations shall drink continually,Yea they shall drink and swallow down, and shall be, as though they had not been.

17. But, in Mount Zion, shall be a delivered remnant which shall be holy,and the house of Jacob shall possess their own possessions;

18. And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, with the house of Esau for stubble, So shall they kindle upon them, and devour them,and there shall be no survivor to the house of Esau, for, Yahweh, hath spoken.

19. Then shall they of the South possess Mount Esau, and they of the Lowlands, the Philistines, and they   Gilead;

20. And, they of the captivity of this force pertaining to the sons of Israel,   that of the Canaanites, up to Zarephath, and, they of the captivity of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the South.

21. And saviours shall come up in Mount Zion, to judge the mountain of Esau,So shall the kingdom, belong unto Yahweh.
