# Hosea

## Hosea 1

__and will plant his palace-home between the seas, towards the beautiful holy mountain, but shall come to his end, with none to help him.__

1. The word of Yahweh which came unto Hosea son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah,and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel.

2. The beginning of the word of Yahweh with Hosea, was,that Yahweh said unto Hosea, Go take thee a woman of unchastity, and the children of unchastity, for, unchastely indeed, hath the land been going away from following Yahweh.

3. So he went and took Gomer, daughter of Diblaim,and she conceived and bare him a son.

4. Then said Yahweh unto him, Call his name Jezreel: for, yet a little, and I will visit the bloodshed of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.

5. And it shall come to pass, in that day, that I will break the bow of Israel, in the vale of Jezreel.

6. Then conceived she again and bare a daughter, and he said to him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah   ,for, not again any more, will I have compassion upon the house of Israel, that I should, forgive, them;

7. but, on the house of Judah, will I have compassion, and I will save them, as Yahweh their God,but will not save them by bow, or by sword, or by battle, by horses, or by horsemen.

8. And, when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.

9. Then said he, Call his name Lo-ammi,for ye are Lo-ammi

10. Yet shall the number of the sons of Israel become like the sand of the sea, which can neither he measured, nor numbered,and it shall come to pass, in the place where it used to be said to them, No people of mine, are ye, it shall be said to them, Sons of a Living God!

11. Then shall the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel, gather themselves together, as one, and shall appoint them one head, and come up out of the earth,for great shall be the day of Jezreel.

## Hosea 2

1. Say ye unto your brethren, O Ammi, and unto your sisters, O Ruhamah: \fs15

2. Contend ye with your mother, contend, for she is no wife of mine, and I am no husband of hers, Let her then put away her paramours from before her, and her partners in adultery, from her embraces:

3. Lest I strip off her under-clothing, and set her forth to view, as in the day she was born,and make her like a wilderness, and render her like a land that is parched, and suffer her to die of thirst;

4. And, on her children, not have compassion,because, the children of paramours, they are.

5. For their mother, hath been unchaste, and she that conceived them, hath caused shame,for she said, Let me go after my lovers! who used to give my bread, and my water, my wool, and my flax, mine oil, and my drink.

6. Therefore, behold me! hedging up her way, with thorns,and I will wall her in, and, her footpaths, shall she not find.

7. And, when she shall pursue her lovers, and not overtake them, and shall seek them and not find, then will she say, Let me go my way now! and return unto my first husband, for it was better with me, then, than, now!

8. But, she, owneth not, that, I, gave herthe corn, and the new wine and the oil,silver, also increased I unto her, and gold  they offered to Baal!

9. Therefore, will I again take away my corn, in the time thereof, and my new wine, in the season thereof,and will recover my wool and my flax   to hide her shame.

10. Now, therefore, will I expose her unseemliness, before the eyes of her lovers,and no, man, shall deliver her out of my hand!

11. And I will cause to cease all her mirth, her pilgrim-festival, her new moon and her sabbath,and her every appointed meeting;

12. And will lay waste her vine and her fig- tree, as to which she hath said, A present, are they for myself, which my lovers, have given me,and I will make of them a thicket, and the wild beasts of the field shall devour them.

13. So will I visit upon her the days of the Baals, unto whom she used to burn incense, and decked herself with her nose-ring and her jewelry, and went her way after her lovers,whereas, me, she forgat, Declareth Yahweh.

14. Therefore, lo! I, am going to persuade her, and, though I conduct her forth into wilderness, yet will I speak unto her heart.

15. Then will I give to her her vineyards from thence, and the vale of Achor for a door of hope,and she will respond there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. \fs15

16. And it shall come to pass, in that day, Declareth Yahweh, that she will call me Ishi, and will not call me any more, Baali.

17. So will I take away the names of the Baals, out of her mouth,and they shall not be called to mind any more, by their name. \fs15

18. And I will solemnize to them a covenant, in that day, with the wild-beast of the field, and with the bird of the heavens, and the creeping thing of the ground,and, bow and sword and battle, will I break in pieces out of the land, so will I cause them to lie down, in security.

19. And I will take thee unto myself, unto times age-abiding,yea I will take thee unto myself, in righteousness and in justice, and in lovingkindness, and in abounding compassion:

20. Yea I will take thee unto myself, in faithfulness,So shalt thou know Yahweh.

21. And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will respond, Declareth Yahweh, I will respond to the heavens,and, they, shall respond to the earth;

22. And, the earth, shall respond to the corn, and to the new wine and to the oil,and, they, shall respond to Jezreel \fs15

23. So will I sow her unto me in the land, and will have compassion upon the uncompassionated one,and will say to him who was No-people-of-mine, My people, thou art, and, he, shall say, My God! \fs15

## Hosea 3

1. Then said Yahweh unto me, Once more, go love a woman who loveth a friend, and is an adulteress,according to the love of Yahweh unto the sons of Israel, though they keep turning away unto other gods, and love   raisin-cakes.

2. So I secured n her to me, for fifteen pieces of silver,and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley;

3. and I said unto her, Many days, shalt thou tarry for me, thou shalt not be unchaste, neither shalt thou become another mans,moreover also, I,   for thee.

4. For, many days, shall the sons of Israel tarry, without king, and without ruler, and without sacrifice, and without pillar; and without ephod, or household gods.

5. Afterwards, shall the sons of Israel return, and seek Yahweh their God, and David their king,and shall turn with throbbing hearts unto Yahweh and unto his goodness, in the afterpart of the days.

## Hosea 4

1. Hear the word of Yahweh, ye sons of Israel,that, a controversy, hath Yahweh with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no faithfulness, nor lovingkindness, nor knowledge of God, in the land:

2. Cursing and lying, and killing and stealing, and committing adultery, have broken forth, and, blood-shedding, unto blood-shedding, doth extend.

3. For this cause, shall the land mourn, and everyone who dwelleth therein shall languish, with the wild beast of the field and with the bird of the heavens,moreover also, the fishes of the sea, shall be withdrawn.

4. Howbeit let, no man, contend, nor let him rebuke another,since, thy people, are as they who contend against a priest:

5. So shouldst thou stumble in the daytime, and even the prophet stumble with thee, in the night,and I should destroy thine own mother.

6. My people, are destroyed, for lack of knowledge,Because, thou, hast rejected knowledge, therefore will I reject thee from ministering as priest unto me, and, because thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also, will forget thy children.

7. As they were magnified, so, they sinned against me,My gloryfor what was contemptible, did they exchange.

8. The sin of my people, they do eat,and. unto their iniquity, lift they up every man his desire.

9. So doth it come to belike people, like priest,therefore will I visit upon him his ways, and, his doings, will I bring back to him;

10. And they shall eat, and not be satisfied, they have encouraged unchastity, yet have not been making increase,for unto, Yahweh, have they left off giving heed:

11. Unchastity, and wine, and new wine, take away the heart.

12. My people, of their Wood, do ask,Let, their Staff, then tell them,for, the spirit of unchastity, hath led them astray, and they have unchastely departed from under their God.

13. On the headlands of the mountains, they sacrifice, and, on the hills, burn they incense, under oak and poplar and terebinth, because, pleasant, is the shade thereof: For this cause, do your daughters, become unchaste, and, your brides, commit adultery.

14. I do not bring punishment upon your daughters when they become unchaste, nor upon your brides, when they commit adultery, for, the men themselves, with unchaste women, do seclude themselves, and, with the common women of the shrine, do offer sacrifice,and, a people who will not discern, must be ruined.

15. Though unchaste art thou, O Israel, let not Judah, become guilty, neither let them enter Gilgal, nor go up to Beth-aven, and   swear, By the life of Yahweh!

16. For, as a heifer that is stubborn, hath Israel, been stubborn,Now, can Yahweh, turn them out to pasture, like a young ram in a wide place?

17. Mated with idols, is Ephraim, let him alone.

18. Their drinking-bout, having passed,they became, unchaste, they loved wildly, a contempt, became her great men.

19. The wind hath bound her up in its wings,that they may be ashamed, because of their sacrifices.

## Hosea 5

1. Hear ye thisO priests, and attend, O house of Israel, and ye, House of the King, give ear, for, to you, pertaineth the sentence,for, a snare, have ye been to Mizpah, and a net spread on Tabor.

2. And, a slaughter, have apostates deeply designed,though, I, was a rebuker to them all.

3. I, have known Ephraim, and, Israel, hath not been hidden from me,for, now, hast thou committed unchastity, O Ephraim, Israel, hath made himself impure.

4. Their doings, will not suffer, them to return unto their God,for, the spirit of unchastity, is within them, and, Yahweh, have they not known.

5. Therefore will the Excellency of Israel, answer, to his face,and, Israel and Ephraim, shall stumble in their iniquity, even Judah with them, hath stumbled.

6. With their flocks and with their herds, will they go to seek Yahweh, but shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from them.

7. With Yahweh, have they dealt treacherously, for, to alien children, have they given birth,now, a new moon, shall devour them, with their portions.

8. Blow ye a horn in Gibeah, a trumpet in Ramah,sound an alarm at Beth-aven, behind thee, O Benjamin!

9. Ephraim, shall become, a desolation, in the day of rebuke: Throughout the tribes of Israel, have I hide known what is sure.

10. The rulers of Judah have become as they who remove a land-mark. Upon them, will I pour out, like water, my wrath.

11. Oppressed, is Ephraim, crushed in judgment,because he hath, wilfully, walked after falsehood.

12. But, I, was like a moth, to Ephraim,and like rotten wood to the house of Judah.

13. When Ephraim, saw, his injury, and Judah his wound, then went Ephraim unto Assyria, and   sent unto a hostile king,yet, he, cannot heal you, nor will the wound, remove from you.

14. For, I, will be as a lion unto Ephraim, and as a young lion to the house of Judah,I, I, will tear in pieces, and depart, I will carry off, and none be able to rescue.

15. I will depart, will return unto my place! till what time they acknowledge their guilt, and seek my face,In their trouble, will they make for me diligent search.

## Hosea 6

1. Come, and let us return unto Yahweh! for, he, hath torn, that he might heal us,smitten, that he might bind us up.

2. He will bring us to life, after two days,on the third day, will he raise us up, that we may live before him.

3. Then let us knowlet us press on to knowYahweh, Like the dawn, is his coming forth assured,that he may come like a down-pour upon us, like the harvest-rain,

4. What can I do unto thee, O Ephraim? What can I do unto thee, O Judah? for, your lovingkindness, is like a morning cloud, yea, like the dew, early departing!

5. For this cause, have I hewn them in pieces by the prophets, I have slain them by the sayings of my mouth,and, my justice, as a light goeth forth.

6. For, lovingkindness, I desired, and not sacrifice,and the knowledge of God, more than ascending-offerings.

7. But, they, like Adam, have transgressed a covenant,There, have they dealt treacherously with me.

8. Gilead, is a city of workers of iniquity,tracked with blood.

9. And, like liers in wait for a man, in troops, is a band of priests, on the road, will they murder towards Shechem,because, a shameful deed, they have done.

10. In the house of Israel, have I seen a horrible thing,there, the unchastity of Ephraim, defiled is Israel.

11. Judah too! a harvest is appointed for thee,in that I will bring back the captivity of my people.

## Hosea 7

1. When I would have brought healing to Israel, then was disclosed the iniquity of Ephraim, and the wicked doings of Samaria, for they have wrought falsehood,when, a thief, would enter, a band roamed about, outside,

2. And they say not to their own hearts, that, all their wickedness, I remember, now, have their doings, beset them about, right before my face, have they been done.

3. By their wickedness, they gladden a king, and, by their flatteries,rulers.

4. They all, are adulterers, like an oven too hot for the baker,who leaveth off stoking, after kneading the dough, till the whole be leavened.

5. In the day of our king, the rulers, have made themselves ill, with the heat of wine,he hath extended his hand with scoffers.

6. For they have made ready, like an oven, their heart, by their lying in wait,all the night, their baker sleepeth, in the morning, he, kindleth up as it were a blazing fire.

7. They all, become hot as an oven, and devour their judges,all their kings, have fallen, there hath been none among them crying unto me.

8. As for Ephraim! with the peoples, hath he been mingling himself,Ephraim, is a cake not turned.

9. Foreigners have, eaten up, his strength, and, he, knoweth it not,even gray hairs, are sprinkled upon him, and, he, knoweth it not.

10. Therefore doth the Excellency of Israel, answer, to his face; yet have they not returned unto Yahweh their God, nor have they sought him, in spite of all this!

11. So then, Ephraim, hath become, like a simple dove, having no understanding, on Egypt, have they called, to Assyria, have they gone,

12. Whithersoever they go, I will spread over them my net, like a bird of the heavens, will I bring them down, I will chastise them, by the time the report can reach the flock of them.

13. Woe to them! for they have taken flight from me, destruction to them! for they have transgressed against me,when, I, would have ransomed them, then, they, spakeconcerning mefalsehoods.

14. Neither made they outcry unto me, in their heart, although they kept on howling upon their beds, over corn and new wine, they gathered themselves together, they rebelled against me.

15. When, I, had warned them, I strengthened their arm,yet, against me, kept they on devising wickedness.

16. They would returnnot to him who is on high! They have become like a deceitful bow, their rulers, shall fall by the sword, for the rage of their tongue, this,

## Hosea 8

1. To thy mouth, with a horn! Like an eagle, on the house of Yahweh,because they have violated my covenant, and, against my law, have they transgressed.

2. Unto me, shall they make outcry, My God! we acknowledge thee  , Israel!

3. Israel hath cast away what is good,an enemy, shall pursue him.

4. They, have appointed kings, but not from me, have made rulers, but I have not acknowledged them: of their silver and their gold, they made themselves idols, to the end they might be cut off.

5. He hath cast away thy calf, O Samaria, kindled is mine anger upon them,How long shall they not endure to be innocent?

6. For, of Israel, is even that thing! A craftsman, made it, and, a No-god, it is! For, into fragments, shall the Calf of Samaria be broken.

7. For, to the wind, they sow, and, to the whirlwind, they reap: stalk, hath it none, That which shooteth forth, shall yield no meal, If so be it yield, foreigners, swallow it lip,

8. Swallowed up, is Israel; Now, have they gone among the nations, like a vessel in which no man taketh, delight.

9. For, they, have gone up to Assyria, A wild ass going alone for himself, is Ephraim! They have hired lovers!

10. Even though they hire them among the nations, at once, will I gather them, when they have begun to be diminished by reason of the burden of the king of rulers.

11. Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars sinfully, they have become to him the altars of sin.

12. I have been wont to write for him the myriad things of my law,Like something alien, have they been accounted.

13. My sacrificial gifts, have they been sacrificing as   flesh, and have eaten, Yahweh, hath not accepted them,Now, will he call to mind their iniquity, that he may punish their sin, they, to Egypt, will return.

14. And so Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and hath built temples, and, Judah, hath multiplied fortified cities,Therefore will I send a fire upon his cities, and it shall consume the palaces thereof.

## Hosea 9

1. Do not rejoice, O Israel, with exultation, like the peoples, for thou hast gone away unchastely from beside thy God,thou hast loved a present, upon all the threshing-floors of corn!

2. Threshing-floor and wine-vat, will not feed them, and, new wine, will deny them.

3. They shall not dwell in the land of Yahweh, but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and, in Assyriathat which is unclean, shall they eat.

4. They shall not pour out to Yahwehwine, neither shall they be pleasing to him, their sacrifices, are as the food of mourning to them, all that eat thereof, shall defile themselves, because, their food for their appetite, entereth not into the house of Yahweh.

5. What will ye do, for the day of appointed meeting? and in the day of the festival of Yahweh?

6. For, though they have gone from destruction, yet, Egypt, shall gather them, Memphis, shall bury them,as for their silver favorites! thistles, shall possess them, thorns in their tents.

7. Come are the days of visitation, come are the days of recompense, Let Israel know! The prophet is foolish, the man of the spirit doth rave, because of the greatness of thine iniquity, therefore great is the prosecution.

8. The watchman of Ephraim,   , in the house of his God.

9. They have deeply corrupted themselves, like the days of Gibeah: he will call to mind their iniquity, he will punish their sins.

10. Like grapes in the desert, found I Israel, like the first-ripe in the fig-tree when it is young, saw I your fathers,they, entered Baal-peor, and devoted themselves to the Shameful Thing, Then became their abominations like their lusts.

11. As for Ephraim! like a bird, did their glory, fly away,no birth, and none with child, no conception.

12. Yea, though they rear their children, yet will I make them childless, till there be no human being,for it is, nothing less than woe, to them when I depart from them!

13. Ephraim! just as I provided for Tyre, was planted in a meadow,yet, Ephraim, must needs bring forth for a murderer his children.

14. Give them, O Yahwehwhat wilt thou give? Give them, a miscarrying womb, and breasts dried up.

15. All their wickedness, is in Gilgal, yea, there, have I come to hate them, For the wickedness of their doingsout of my house, will I drive them forth,no more will I love them, all their rulers, are unruly.

16. Smitten is Ephraim, their root, hath dried up, fruit, shall they not bear,yea, though they do bring forth, yet will I slay the darlings of their womb.

17. My God will reject them, because they hearkened not unto him,that they may become wanderers throughout the nations.

## Hosea 10

1. A luxuriant vine, is Israel, fruit, beseemeth him,According to the abundance of his fruit, hath he brought abundance to the altars, according to the goodliness of his land, hath he made goodly statues.

2. Hypocritical is their heart, Now, shall they be held guilty,He, will break down their altars, he will destroy their statutes.

3. For, now, will they say, We have no king,for we revere not Yahweh, and what could, a king, do for us?

4. They have spoken words, swearing falsely, in solemnizing a covenant,therefore shall judgment, spring up like a poisonous plant, on the ridges of the field.

5. About the calves of Beth-aven, will the inhabitant of Samaria be concerned,for the people thereof, have mourned over it, and, the ascetics thereof, who, over it, used to exult,   for the glory thereof, because it hath departed therefrom.

6. Itself also, to Assyria, shall be borne along, as a present to a hostile king,shame, shall Ephraim receive, that Israel, may be ashamed, of his own counsel.

7. Silenced is Samaria: her king, is as a chip on the face of the waters,

8. So shall the high places of Aven, be destroyed, the sin of Israel, Thorn and prickle, shall come up on their altars,Therefore shall they say to the mountains, Cover us, and to the hills, Fall on us.

9. Beyond the days of Gibeah, hast thou sinned, O Israel: there, came they to a stand, the battle against the sons of perversity, touched them not in Gibeah.

10. When I please, then will I chastise them,and there shall be gathered together against thempeoples, they being harnessed to their two Iniquities;

11. But, Ephraim, shall be a heifer broken in, loving to tread out corn, when, I, have passed over upon her fair neck,I will drive Ephraim, Judah, shall plow, Jacob, shall harrow to him.

12. Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap ye at thc bidding of lovingkindness, furrow to yourselves the newly-ploughed soil,then will be the time to seek Yahweh, until he come, that he may rain down righteousness for you.

13. Ye have plowed lawlessness, perversity, have ye reaped, ye have eaten the fruit of deception,because thou didst trust in thy chariots, in the multitude of thy mighty men.

14. Therefore shall there arise a tumult among thy peoples, and, all thy fortresses, shall be plundered, as Shalman plundered Beth-arbel, in the day of battle,the mother, upon her children, dashed to the ground.

15. Even so, hath Bethel, done to you, because of your exceeding wickedness,in the dawn, shall the king of Israel be, utterly silenced.

## Hosea 11

1. When Israel was, a child, then I loved him,and, out of Egypt, called I my son.

2. They invited them,at once, they departed from before me, they, to the Baals, sacrificed, and, to the images, offered incense.

3. Yet, I, had taught Ephraim to walk, I used to take them upon mine arms,But they acknowledged not that I had healed them.

4. With human cords, used I to draw them, with the bands of love, so became I unto them like those who remove the yoke   to him, I let him eat.

5. He was not to turn back into the land of Egypt, Howbeit, the Assyrianhe, became his king, for they refused to turn.

6. Therefore shall the sword, rage, in his cities, and make an end of his multitudes, and consume them,because of their counsels.

7. But, my people, are bent towards turning from me, though upwards they call them, none of them can lift them.

8. How can I give thee up, Ephraim? abandon thee Israel? How can I make thee as Admah? set thee as Zeboim? Mine own heart, turneth against me, at once, are kindled my compassions.

9. I cannot execute the glow of mine anger, I cannot turn to destroy Ephraim,for, GOD, am, I, and not man, When thou drawest near,   a Holy One, though I do not enter a city.

10. After Yahweh, let them go, Like a lion, will he roar,When, he, shall roar, then let sons, come trembling, out of the West.

11. Let them come trembling like a small bird out of Egypt, and like a dove out of the land of Assyria,so will I cause them to dwell by their own houses, Declareth Yahweh.

12. They have compassed me aboutwith denial, Ephraim, with deceit, the house of Israel,but, Judah, hath, again and again, run riot with GOD, though, with the holy places, entrusted.

## Hosea 12

1. Ephraim, feedeth on wind, and pursueth the east wind, all the day, falsehood and force, doth he magnify,and, a covenant with Assyria, would they solemnize, and, oil into Egypt, must be borne along.

2. But, a controversy, hath Yahweh with Judah,so that he may bring punishment on Jacob, according to his ways, According to his doings, repay him.

3. In the womb, took he his brother by the heel; and, in his manly vigour, strove he with God:

4. Yea he strove against a Messenger, and prevailed, he wept, and made supplication unto him,At Bethel, he found him, and, there, he spake with us;

5. And, Yahweh, is God of host,Yahweh, is his memorial.

6. Thou, therefore, by thy God, shalt return,lovingkindness and justice, do thou keep, so wait thou for thy God, continually.

7. A trafficker! in his hand, are balances of deceit, to oppress, he loveth.

8. So then Ephraim said, Surely I have gotten me riches, I have found wealth for myself,in all my toils, they cannot find in me perversity which is sin.

9. But, I, Yahweh, have been thy God, from the land of Egypt,I will yet make thee dwell in tents, as in the days of appointed meeting.

10. And I will lay my word upon the prophets, yea, I myself, have magnified, vision,and, by the hand of the prophets, will I use similitudes.

11. If, Gilead, is in sorrow, surely false, have they been, In Gilgal, have they sacrificed, bullocks,their very altars, shall become as heaps upon the furrows of the field.

12. When Jacob fled to the country of Syria, then Israel served for a wife, and, for a wife, he watched over a flock.

13. And, by a prophet, Yahweh, brought up, Israel out of Egypt,and, by a prophet, was he watched over.

14. Ephraim hath provoked, very bitterly,his own blood, therefore, upon him, will he leave, and, his reproach, shall his Lord, bring back to him.

## Hosea 13

1. When Ephraim, spake, there was terror, exalted was, he, in Israel,but, when he became guilty with Baal, then he died.

2. Now, therefore they go on to sin, and have made them a Molten Thing out of their silver, after the notion of idols, the workmanship of craftsmen, all of it! Of them, are they sayingYe sacrificers of men! The Great Calf, shall ye surely kiss!

3. Therefore, shall they become like the morning cloud, and like the dew early departing,like chaff storm-driven out of the threshing-floor, and like smoke out of a chimney.

4. Yet, I, Yahweh, have been thy God from the land of Egypt,and, god beside me, shalt thou not acknowledge, for, saviour, is there none besides me.

5. I, tended thee in the desert,in a land parched with drought:

6. Whenever they were pastured, then were they satisfied, They were satisfied, and their heart, was lifted up,because of this, they forgat me.

7. Therefore am I become to them as a lion,As a leopard by the way, do I watch.

8. I will fall upon them as a bear bereaved, and will read asunder the enclosure of their heart,that I may devour them there, like a lioness, the wild beast of the field, shall tear them in pieces.

9. It hath utterly destroyed thee, O Israel, for it was against me, as thy helper!

10. Where is thy king, then, that he may save thee throughout all thy cities? and thy judges, concerning whom thou saidst, Oh give me a king and rulers?

11. I might give thee a king in mine anger, and take him away in my wrath.

12. Bound up, is the iniquity of Ephraim, stored away, his sin.

13. The pangs of a woman in labour, shall overtake him,he, is a son, not wise, for, now, he cannot stand still, when children are about to be born.

14. Out of the hand of hades, will I ransom them, out of death, will I redeem them,Where is thy pestilence, O death? Where thy plague, O hades? Repentance, shall be hid from mine eyes.

15. Though, he, among brethren, be fruitful, there shall come in an east wind, the blast of Yahweh out of the desert coming up, that his spring, may dry up, and his fountain, be exhausted, he, will rob the treasure-house of all the vessels of delight.

16. Samaria, shall be held guilty, for she hath rebelled against her God, By the sword, shall they fall, their infants, shall be dashed to the ground, and, his women with child, shall be ripped up.

## Hosea 14

1. Return thou, O Israel, unto Yahweh thy God,for thou hast stumbled by thine iniquity.

2. Take with you words, and return to Yahweh: say unto himWholly, shalt thou take away iniquity, Accept, then, with favour, and we will make good the boldness of our lips!

3. Assyria, shall not save us, Upon horses, will we not ride, neither will we say any moreOur god! to the work of our own hands! For, in thee, shall the fatherless, find compassion.

4. I will heal their apostacy, I will love them freely,for mine anger, hath turned, from them.

5. I will become as the dew unto Israel, he shall break forth as the lily,and he shall strike his roots as Lebanon:

6. His branches, shall spread, that, like an olive-tree, may be his fresh beauty,and his fragrance, like Lebanon.

7. They who dwell in his shade shall again show life like the corn, and break forth as the vine,and, the remembrance of him, shall be like the wine of Lebanon.

8. Ephraim   What to me any more are idols? I, have answered, and have closely observed him, I, am like a fir-tree that is green, From me, is thy fruit found.

9. Who is wise, that he may understand these things? intelligent, that he may take knowledge of them? For, straightforward, are the ways of Yahweh, and, the righteous, shall travel therein, but, transgressors, shall stumble therein.
