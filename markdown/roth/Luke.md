## Luke 1

__Now, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Joses, were viewing how he had been laid.__

1. Seeing, indeed, that, many, had taken in hand to re-arrange for themselves a narrative, concerning the facts which have been fully confirmed amongst us,

2. according as they who from the beginning became eye-witnesses and attendants of the Word delivered them unto us,

3. it seemed good, even to me, having closely traced from the outset all things accurately, to write unto thee, in order, most excellent Theophilus:

4. that, as touching the matters which thou hadst been taught by word of mouth, thou mightest obtain full knowledge, of the certainty.

5. It came to pass, in the days of Herod, king of Judaea, that there was a certain priest, by name Zachariah, of the daily course of Abia; and that he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and, her name, was Elizabeth.

6. Now they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and righteous appointments of the Lord, blameless;

7. and they had no child, inasmuch as Elizabeth was barren, and, both, had become, advanced in their days.

8. But it came to pass, as he was doing priestly service in the order of his daily course, before God,

9. according to the custom of his priesthood, it fell to his lot to offer incense, entering into the Temple of the Lord;

10. and, all the throng of the people, was praying outside, at the hour of the incense offering.

11. And there appeared unto him a messenger of the Lord, standing on the right hand of the altar of incense;

12. and Zachariah was troubled when he beheld, and, fear, fell upon him.

13. But the messenger said unto himDo not fear, Zachariah! Inasmuch as thy supplication hath been hearkened to,and, thy wife Elizabeth, shall bring forth a son to thee, and thou shalt call his name, John;

14. And there shall be joy to thee and exulting, and, many, over his birth, shall rejoice;

15. For he shall be great before the Lord, and, wine and strong drink, in nowise may he drink, and, with Holy Spirit, shall he be filled, already, from his mothers womb;

16. And, many of the Sons of Israel, shall he turn towards the Lord their God;

17. And, he, shall go before him, in the spirit and power of Elijah,To turn the hearts of fathers unto children, and the unyielding, into the prudence of the righteous, and to prepare, for the Lord, a people made ready.

18. And Zachariah said unto the messengerWhereby, shall I know this? for, I, am, aged, and, my wife, advanced in her days.

19. And the messenger, answering, said unto himI, am Gabriel,he that standeth near before God; and have been sent forth to speak unto thee, and to deliver the joyful message unto thee, as touching these things.

20. And lo! thou shalt be silent, and not able to speak until the day when these things shall come to pass; because thou didst not believe in my words,the which shall be fulfilled for their season.

21. And the people were expecting Zachariah, and began to marvel that he should tarry in the Temple;

22. and when he came forth he was not able to speak unto them, and they perceived that, a vision, he had seen in the Temple,and, he, continued making signs unto them, and remained dumb.

23. And it came to pass, when the days of his public ministration were fulfilled, that he departed unto his house.

24. And, after these days, Elizabeth his wife conceived, and she disguised herself five months, saying

25. Thus, for me, hath the Lord wrought,in the days in which he looked upon me, to take away my reproach among men.

26. Now, in the sixth month, was the messenger Gabriel sent forth from God, into a city of Galilee, the name of which was Nazareth,

27. unto a virgin, betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and, the name of the virgin, was, Mary;

28. and entering in unto her, he saidJoy to thee, favoured one! The Lord, be with thee!

29. And, she, at the word, was greatly troubled, and began to deliberate, of what kind, this salutation, might be.

30. And the messenger said unto herDo not fear, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God,

31. And 1o! thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name, Jesus:

32. the same, shall be great, and, Son of the Most High, shall be called, and the Lord God, will give unto him, the throne of David his father,

33. And he shall reign over the house of Jacob, unto the ages, and, of his kingdom, there shall be, no end.

34. But Mary said unto the messengerHow, shall this thing be, seeing that, a man, I know not?

35. And answering, the messenger said unto herThe Holy Spirit, shall come upon thee, and, the power of the Most High, shall overshadow thee; wherefore, even that which is to be born, Holy, shall be called, Son of God.

36. And lo! Elizabeth thy kinswoman, even she, hath conceived a son in, her old-age;and, this month, is, the sixth, to her, the so-called barren one;

37. Because no declaration from God, shall be void of power.

38. And Mary saidLo! the handmaid of the Lord! Might it come to pass unto me, according to thy declaration. And the messenger departed from her.

39. And Mary, arising, in these days, journeyed into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah,

40. and entered into the house of Zachariah, and saluted Elizabeth.

41. And it came to pass that, as Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leapt in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with Holy Spirit,

42. and lifted up her voice with loud exclamation, and saidBlessed, art thou among women, and, blessed, is the fruit of thy womb;

43. And, whence, to me is, this, That the mother of my Lord should come, unto me?

44. For lo! as the sound of thy salutation came into mine ears, the babe in my womb, leapt in exultation.

45. And, happy, is she who hath believed, that there shall be a perfecting of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!

46. And Mary saidMy soul doth magnify the Lord,

47. And my spirit hath exulted upon God my saviour;

48. Because he hath looked upon the humbling of his handmaid; for lo! from the present time, all the generations, will pronounce me happy.

49. Because he that is mighty hath done for me great things, and, holy, is his name;

50. And his mercy is unto generations and generations, to them who revere him;

51. He hath wrought strength with his arm, He hath scattered men arrogant in the intention of their heart;

52. He hath deposed potentates from thrones, and uplifted the lowly;

53. The hungry, hath he filled with good things, and, the wealthy, hath he sent empty away;

54. He hath laid hold of Israel his servant, to be mindful of mercies:

55. According as he spake unto our fathers,To Abraham, and to his seed,Unto times age-abiding.

56. And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned unto her house.

57. And, to Elizabeth, was the time fulfilled, that she should be bringing forth,and she gave birth to a son.

58. And her neighbours and kinsfolk heard, that the Lord had magnified his mercy with her, and they were rejoicing with her.

59. And it came to pass, on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child, and were calling it, after the name of its father, Zachariah.

60. And his mother, answering, saidNay! but he shall be called, John.

61. And they said unto herThere is, no one from among thy kindred, who is called by this name!

62. And they began making signs unto his father, as to what he might be wishing it to be called.

63. And, asking for a small tablet, he wrote, sayingJohn, is his name! and they marvelled all.

64. And his mouth was opened instantly, and his tongue   , and he began to speak, blessing, God.

65. And fear came upon all the neighbours themselves; and, throughout all the hill-country of Judaea, were all these matters being much talked of;

66. and all who heard laid

67. And, Zachariah his father, was filled with Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying:

68. Blessed, be the Lord, the God of Israel! Because he hath visited and wrought redemption for his people,

69. And hath raised up a horn of salvation for us, In the house of David his servant:

70. According as he hath spoken by mouth of his holy ancient prophets,

71. Of salvation from among our foes, and out of the hand of all them that hate us:

72. To perform mercy with our fathers, and to be mindful of his holy covenant,

73. The oath which he sware unto Abraham our father, To grant us,

74. without fear, from the hand of enemies rescued, to be rendering divine service unto him,

75. in lovingkindness and righteousness before him, all our days.

76. And, even thou, child, prophet of the Most High, shalt be called,for thou shall march on before the Lord, to prepare his ways,

77. Giving a knowledge of salvation unto his people, by a remission of their sins.

78. Because of the yearning compassion of the mercy of our God, wherein shall visit us a day-dawn from on high,

79. To shine on them who, in the darkness and shade of death, are sitting, to guide our feet into a way of peace.

80. And, the child, went on growing, and being strengthened in spirit, and was in the deserts, until the day he was pointed out unto Israel.

## Luke 2

1. Now it came to pass, in those days, that there went forth a decree from Caesar Augustus, for all the inhabited earth to be enrolled:

2. this enrolment, first was made while Cyrenius was governor of Syria:

3. and all were journeying to be enrolled, each one unto his own city.

4. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of a city Nazareth, into Judaea, into the city of David which is called Bethlehem; because he was of the house and family of David:

5. to enrol himself with Mary who was betrothed to him, she being with child.

6. And it came to pass, while they were there, that the days were fulfilled for her to give birth;

7. and she gave birth to her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.

8. And there were, shepherds, in the same country, dwelling in the fields, and keeping the watches of the night over their flock.

9. And, a messenger of the Lord, stood over them, and, a glory of the Lord, shone round about them; and they feared, a great fear.

10. And the messenger said unto themBe not afraid! For lo! I bring you good tidings of a great joy, the which shall be for all the people:

11. That there hath been born unto you, this day, a saviour,Who is Christ the Lordin the city of David!

12. And, this, to you is, a sign: Ye shall find a babe, wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger.

13. And, suddenly, there came to be, with the messenger, the throng of the heavenly host, praising God, and saying

14. Glory, in the highest, unto God! And, on earth, peace, among men of goodwill.

15. And it came to pass, when the messengers had departed from them into heaven, that, the shepherds, began to say one to anotherLet us go through forthwith as far as to Bethlehem, and see this thing which hath come to pass, which the Lord hath made known to us.

16. And they came, with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.

17. Now, when they beheld, they made known concerning the thing which had been told them as to this child.

18. And, all who heard, marvelled concerning the things which had been told by the shepherds unto them;

19. but, Mary, was closely observing, all, these things, putting them together in her heart.

20. And the shepherds returned, giving glory and singing praise unto God, over all things which they had heard and seen, according as it had been told unto them.

21. And, when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him, then was his name called, Jesus,which it was called by the messenger, before he was conceived in the womb.

22. And, when the days of their purification, according to the law of Moses, were fulfilled, they took him up into Jerusalem, to present   unto the Lord,

23. according as it is written in the law of the LordEvery male that is a firstborn, Holy unto the Lord, shall be called,

24. and to give a sacrifice, according to that which is said in the law of the LordA pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons.

25. And lo! there was, a man, in Jerusalem, whose name, was Symeon; and, this man, was righteous and devout, awaiting the consolation of Israel, and Holy Spirit was upon him;

26. and it had been intimated to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Christ of the Lord.

27. And he came, in the Spirit, into the temple; and, when the parents brought in the child Jesus, that they might do according to that which was customary by the law concerning it,

28. even he, welcomed it into his arms, and blessed God, and said

29. Now, dost thou dismiss thy servant, O Sovereign, according to thy declarationin peace;

30. Because mine eyes have seen thy salvation,

31. Which thou hast prepared in face of all the peoples:

32. A light for the unveiling of nations, and the glory of thy people Israel.

33. And his father and mother were marvelling over the things which were being spoken concerning him.

34. And Symeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his motherLo! this one, is being set for the falling and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign to be spoken against;

35. And, thou! through thy very soul, shall pass a sword, that, reasonings, may be revealed, out of many hearts.

36. And there was one Anna, a prophetess, daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher;the same, advanced in many days; having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,

37. and, she, had been a widow for as long as eighty-four years,who left not the temple, with fastings and supplications, rendering divine service night and day;

38. and, in that very hour, coming near, she began to give thanks unto God, and to speak concerning him unto all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.

39. And, when they had finished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, into their own city, Nazareth.

40. And, the child, went on growing, and waxing strong, becoming filled with wisdom; and, the favour of God, was upon it.

41. And his parents used to journey yearly into Jerusalem, at the feast of the passover.

42. And, when he became twelve years, and they went up, according to the custom of the feast,

43. and completed the days, and then were returning, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem,and his parents noticed it not;

44. but, supposing him to be in the company, went a days journey, and then began to seek for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances,

45. and, not finding him, returned unto Jerusalem, seeking him.

46. And it came to pass, that, after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting amidst the teachers,both hearkening unto them, and questioning them.

47. Now all who heard him were beside themselves, because of his understanding and his answers.

48. And, when they behold him, they were astounded, and his mother said unto himChild! why, hast thou dealt with us, thus? Lo! thy father and I, in anguish, were seeking thee.

49. And he said unto themWhy was it that ye were seeking me? Perceived ye not, that, in the courts of my Father, I must needs be?

50. And, they, understood not the thing which he spake to them.

51. And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was submitting himself unto them. And, his mother, was closely observing all these things in her heart.

52. And, Jesus, went on advancing in wisdom, and in stature, and in favour with God and men.

## Luke 3

1. Now, in the fifteenth year of the supremacy of Tiberius Caesar,Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and, Philip his brother, tetrarch of Ituraea and the country of Trachonitis, and Lysanius, tetrarch of Abylene,

2. in the High-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, came a word of God unto John the son, of Zechariah, in rue desert;

3. and he came into all the country about the Jordan, proclaiming an immersion of repentance into remission of sins:

4. as it is written in the book of the discourses of Isaiah the prophet: A voice of one crying aloud! In the desert, prepare ye the way of the Lord, straight, be making his paths;

5. Every chasm, shall be filled up, and, every mountain and hill, be made low; and the, crooked, places shall become, straight, and the, rugged, places, smooth ways;

6. And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.

7. He was saying, therefore, unto the multitudes who were going forth to be immersed by himBroods of vipers! who suggested to you, to flee from the coming wrath?

8. Bring forth, therefore, fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to be saying within yourselves, As our father, we have, Abraham; for, I say unto youGod is able, out of these stones, to raise up children unto Abraham.

9. And, already, even the axe, unto the root of the trees is being laid; every tree, therefore, not bringing forth  good  fruit, is to be hewn down, and, into fire, to be cast.

10. And the multitude began to question him sayingWhat, then, shall we do?

11. And, answering, he said unto themHe that hath two tunics, let him share with him that hath none, and, he that hath food, in like manner, let him be doing.

12. And there came, even tax-collectors, to be immersed; and they said unto himTeacher! what, shall we, do?

13. And, he, said unto them, Nothing more than what is appointed you, exact ye.

14. Then were questioning him, soldiers also, sayingWhat shall, even we, do? And he said unto themMolest ye, no one, neither accuse falsely; and be content with your supplies.

15. Now, as the people were in expectation, and all were deliberating in their hearts, concerning John,whether by any means, he, might be, the Christ,

16. John answered, saying unto allI, indeed, in water, am immersing you, but he that is mightier than I, cometh, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to unloose,he, will immerse you m Holy Spirit and fire:

17. whose fan is in his hand, to clear out his threshing-floor, and to gather the wheat into his granary; but, the chaff, will he burn up with fire unquenchable.

18. So then indeed, as to many things and various, he exhorted, and continued telling his glad-message unto the people.

19. But, Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him concerning Herodias, the wife of his brother, and concerning all the wicked things Herod had done,

20. added this also unto all,he locked up John in prison.

21. Now it came to pass, when one and all the people were immersed, Jesus also, having been immersed, and being at prayer, heaven was opened;

22. and the Holy Spirit descended, in bodily appearance, as a dove, upon him,and, a voice out of heaven, cameThou, art my Son, the Beloved, in thee, I delight.

23. And, Jesus himself, was, when he began, about thirty years of age, being the son, as was supposedof Joseph, of Heli:

24. of Matthat, of Levi, of Melchi,of Jannai, of Joseph:

25. of Mattathias, of Amos, of Nahum,of Esli, of Naggai:

26. of Maath, of Mattathias, of Semein,of Josech, of Joda:

27. of Joanan, of Rhesa, of Zerubbabel,of Salathiel, of Neri:

28. of Melchi, of Addi, of Cosam,of Elmadam, of Er:

29. of Jesus, of Eliezer, of Jorim,of Matthat, of Levi:

30. of Symeon, of Judas, of Joseph,of Jonam, of Eliakim:

31. of Melea, of Menna, of Mattatha,of Natham, of David:

32. of Jesse, of Obed, of Boaz,of Salmon, of Nashon:

33. of Amminadab, of Arni, of Hezron,of Perez, of Judah:

34. of Jacob, of Isaac, of Abraham,of Terah, of Nahor:

35. of Serug, of Reu, of Peleg,of Eber, of Shelah:

36. of Cainan, of Arphaxad, of Shem,of Noah, of Lamech:

37. of Methuselah, of Enoch, of Jared,of Mahalaleel, of Cainan:

38. of Enos, of Seth,of Adam; of God.

## Luke 4

1. And, Jesus, full of Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led in the Spirit in the desert,

2. forty days,being tempted by the adversary; and he did eat nothing in those days,and, when they were concluded, he hungered.

3. And the adversary said to himIf thou art Gods, Son, speak unto this stone; that it become bread.

4. And Jesus made answer unto himIt is written: Not, on bread alone, shall, man, live.

5. And, leading him up, he shewed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth, in a moment of time.

6. And the adversary said to himUnto thee, will I give this authority, all together, and their glory; because, unto me, hath it been delivered up, and, to whomsoever I please, I give it:

7. Thou, therefore, if thou wilt worship before me, it shall all, be thine.

8. And, answering, Jesus said to himIt is written: The Lord thy God, shalt thou worship, and, unto him alone, render divine service.

9. And he led him into Jerusalem, and set him upon the pinnacle of the temple,and said  to him If thou art Gods, Son, cast thyself, from hence, down;

10. for it is writtenUnto his messengers, will he give command concerning thee, to keep vigilant watch over thee,

11. And, On hands, will they take thee up, lest once thou strike, against a stone, thy foot.

12. And Jesus, answering, said to himIt is said: Thou shalt not put to the test the Lord thy God.

13. And, having concluded every temptation, the adversary departed from him until a fitting season.

14. And Jesus returned, in the power of the Spirit, into Galilee; and, a report, went out along the whole of the region, concerning him;

15. and, he, began teaching in their synagogues, being glorified by all.

16. And he came into Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and entered, according to his custom, on the sabbath day, into the synagogue,and stood up to read.

17. And there was handed to him a scroll of the prophet Isaiah; and unfolding the scroll, he found the place where it was written:

18. The Spirit of the Lord, is upon me, because he hath anointed meto tell glad tidings unto the destitute; He hath sent me forth,To proclaim, to captives, a release, and, to the blind, a recovering of sight,to send away the crushed, with a release;

19. To proclaim the welcome year of the Lord.

20. And, folding up the scroll, he handed it to the attendant, and sat down; and, the eyes of all, in the synagogue, were intently fixed upon him;

21. and he began to be saying to themThis day, is fulfilled this scripture, in your ears.

22. And, all, were bearing witness to him, and marvelling at the words of favour which were proceeding out of his mouth; and they were sayingIs not, this, the, son of Joseph?

23. And he said unto themBy all means, ye will speak to me this similitude: Physician! heal, thyself,Whatsoever things we have heard of coming to pass in Capernaum, do here also, in thine own country.

24. And he saidVerily, I say unto you, No prophet, is, welcome, in his own country,

25. And, of a truth, I say unto youMany widows, were in the days of Elijah, in Israel, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there came a great famine upon all the land;

26. And, unto none of them, was Elijah sent, save unto Sarepta of Sidonia, unto a woman that was a widow.

27. And, many lepers, were in Israel, in the time of Elisha the prophet, and, not one of them, was cleansed, save Naaman the Syrian.

28. And all were filled with wrath, in the synagogue, as they heard these things.

29. And, rising up, they thrust him forth outside the city, and led him as far as a brow of the hill on which their city was built,so that they might throw him down headlong.

30. But, he, passing through the midst of them, went his way.

31. And he came down into Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath;

32. and they were being struck with astonishment at his teaching, because, with authority, was his word.

33. And, in the synagogue, was a man having a spirit of an impure demon; and he cried out with a loud voice

34. Let be! What have we in common with thee, O Jesus, Nazarene! Hast thou come to destroy us? I know thee, who thou art,The Holy One of God.

35. And Jesus rebuked it, sayingHold thy peace! and go forth from him. And the demon, throwing him into the midst, went forth from him, doing him no hurt.

36. And amazement came upon all, and they began to converse one with another, sayingWhat is this word, that, with authority and power, he giveth orders unto the impure spirits, and they go forth?

37. And a noise concerning him began to go out into every place of the country around.

38. And, rising up, from the synagogue, he went into the house of Simon. Now, the mother-in-law of Simon, was in distress with a great fever; and they made request to him concerning her.

39. And, standing over her, he rebuked the fever, and it left her; and, instantly arising, she began to minister unto them.

40. But, as the sun was going in, they one and all, as many as had any sick with divers diseases, brought them unto him; and, he, upon each one of them laying, his hands, was curing them.

41. And demons also were going forth from many; crying aloud, and sayingThou, art the Son of God. And, rebuking them, he suffered them not be talking; because they knew him to be, The Christ.

42. And, when it was day, going forth, he journeyed into a desert place; and, the multitudes, were seeking after him, and they came unto him, and would have detained him, that he might not depart from them.

43. But, he, said unto themTo the other cities also, I must needs tell the good-news of the kingdom of God, because, hereunto, was I sent forth.

44. And he was proclaiming in the cities of Judaea.

## Luke 5

1. And it came to pass, while the multitude was pressing upon him, and was hearing the word of God, that, he, was standing near the lake of Gennesaret;

2. and he saw two boats placed near the lake, and, the fishers, having gone away, from them, were washing their nets.

3. And, entering into one of the boats, which was Simons, he requested him, to put off from the land, a little; and, taking a seat, out of the boat, began he teaching the multitudes.

4. And, when he ceased speaking, he said unto SimonPut off into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.

5. And Simon, answering, saidMaster! although through the whole night we toiled, we took, nothing; howbeit, at thy bidding, I will let down the nets.

6. And, when this they had done, they enclosed a very large number of fishes, and their nets began to break.

7. And they made signs to their partners in the other boat, to come and help them; and they came, and filled both the boats,so that they began to sink.

8. And Simon, beholding, fell down at the knees of Jesus, sayingDepart from me! Because, a sinful man, am I, O Lord!

9. For, amazement, overcame him, and all them who were with him, on account of the draught of the fishes which they had taken;

10. likewise also, both James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto SimonDo not fear! henceforth, shall thou be taking, men, that they may, live.

11. And, bringing the boats down on to the land, they left all, and followed him.

12. And it came to pass, while he was in one of the cities, that lo! there was a man full of leprosy; and, seeing Jesus, he fell on his face, and entreated him, sayingLord! if thou be willing, thou canst cleanse me.

13. And, stretching forth the hand, he touched him, sayingI am willing: Be cleansed! And, straightway, the leprosy departed from him.

14. And, he, charged him to tell, no one,but, departing, Show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses enjoined, for a witness unto them.

15. But the report concerning him the more went abroad, and many multitudes were coming together, to hear, and be getting cured from their infirmities;

16. howbeit, he, was retiring in the deserts, and engaging in prayer.

17. And it came to pass, on one of the days, that, he, was teaching, and there were sitting Pharisees and Teachers of the law, who had come out of every village of Galilee and Judaea and Jerusalem; and, the power of the Lord, was there, that he might heal.

18. And lo! men bearing, upon a couch, one who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in, and lay him before him.

19. And, not finding by what means they might bring him in, because of the multitude, going up on the house-top, through the tiling, let they him down, with the little-couch, into the midst before Jesus.

20. And, beholding their faith, he saidO man! thy sins are forgiven thee.

21. And the Scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, sayingWho is this that speaketh profanities? Who can forgive, sins, save, God alone?

22. And Jesus, taking note of their reasonings, answering, said unto themWhy are ye reasoning in your hearts?

23. Which is easier, To sayThy sins are forgiven thee; or to sayArise and be walking?

24. But, that ye may know that, the Son of Man, hath, authority, upon the earth to forgive sinshe said to the paralyzed manTo thee, I say, Arise, and, taking up thy couch, be going thy way unto thy house.

25. And, instantly arising before them, he took up that whereon he had been lying, and departed unto his house, glorifying God.

26. And, astonishment, seized one and all, and they began glorifying God, and were filled with fear, sayingWe have seen unaccountable things, to-day!

27. And, after these things, he went forth, and looked upon a tax-collector, by name Levi,presiding over the tax-office; and he said to himBe following me!

28. And, forsaking all, he arose, and was following him.

29. And Levi made a great reception for him, in his house, and there was a great multitude of tax-collectors, and others,who were with them reclining.

30. And the Pharisees and their Scribes began murmuring unto his disciples, sayingWherefore, with the tax-collectors and sinners, are ye eating and drinking?

31. And, answering, Jesus said unto themNo need, have, the whole, of a physician, but, they who are sick.

32. I have not come to call, righteous, men, but, sinners, unto repentance.

33. But, they, said unto himThe disciples of John, do fast much, and, supplications, do make,likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees; but, thine, do eat and drink!

34. Jesus, however, said unto themCan, ye make, the sons of the bridechamber, fast, while the bridegroom is with them?

35. But there will come days, even when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, then, will they fast, in those days.

36. Moreover, he went on to speak, a parable also, unto themNo one, rending a patch from a new mantle, patcheth it upon an old mantle; otherwise, at least, both, the new, he will rend, and, with the old, the patch which is from the new, will not agree.

37. And, no one, poureth new wine into old skins; otherwise, at least, the new wine, will burst the skins, and will, itself, be poured out, and the skins be destroyed.

38. But, new wine, into unused skins, must be poured.

39.  No one, having drunk old, desireth new; for he saith, The old, is, mellow.

## Luke 6

1. And it came to pass, on a Sabbath, that he was passing along through cornfields, and his disciples were plucking and eating the ears of corn, rubbing them with their hands.

2. But, certain of the Pharisees, saidWhy are ye doing what is not allowed on the Sabbath?

3. And, making answer unto them, Jesus saidHave ye never read, even this, what David did when he hungered, he, and they who were with him

4. How he entered into the house of God, and, the presence-bread, receiving, did eat, and gave to them who were with him, which it is not allowable to eat, save alone, to the priests?

5. And he was saying to themThe Son of Man is, Lord of the Sabbath.

6. And it came to pass, on another Sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue, and was teaching, and there was a man there, and, his right hand, was withered.

7. Now the Scribes and the Pharisees were narrowly watching him, whether, on the Sabbath, he healeth,that they might find whereof to accuse him.

8. But, he, knew their reasonings, and said to the man who had the, withered, handArise, and stand forward in the midst! And, arising, he stood forward.

9. And Jesus said unto themI ask you, whether it is allowed, on the Sabbath, to do good or to do harm,life, to save, or, to destroy.

10. And, looking round upon them all, he said unto himStretch forth thy hand! and, he, did so, and his hand was restored.

11. But, they, were filled with folly, and began conversing one with another, as to, what they might do with Jesus.

12. And it came to pass, in these days, that he went forth into the mountain to pray, and was spending the night in the prayer-house of God.

13. And, when it became day, he called his disciples, and chose from them, twelve, whom also he named, Apostles,

14. Simon, whom also he named Peter, and Andrew hie brother; and James and John; and Philip and Bartholomew;

15. and Matthew and Thomas; and James, son of Alphaeus, and Simon, who was called Zealot; and Judas,   of James,

16. and Judas Iscariot, who became betrayer;

17. and, coming down with them, he stood upon a level place, also a great multitude of his disciples,and a great throng of the people, from all Judaea and Jerusalem and the sea-coast of Tyre and Zidon, who had come to hearken unto him and to be healed from their diseases;

18. and, they who were molested by impure spirits, were being cured;

19. and, all the multitude, were seeking to touch him, because, power, from him, was coming forth, and healing all.

20. And, he, lifting up his eyes towards his disciples, was saying:Happy, ye destitute, for, yours, is the kingdom of God.

21. Happy, ye that hunger now, for ye shall be filled. Happy, ye that weep now, for ye shall laugh.

22. Happy, are ye, whensoever men shall hate you, and whensoever they shall separate you, and reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the sake of the Son of Man:

23. be rejoiced in that day, and leap, for lo! your reward, is great in heaven; for, according to the same things, were their fathers doing unto the prophets.

24. But alas! for you, ye wealthy, for ye are duly receiving you consolation.

25. Alas! for you, ye who are filled full now, for ye shall hunger. Alas! ye that laugh now, for ye shall mourn and weep.

26. Alas! whensoever all men shall, speak well of you, for, according to the same things, were their fathers doing unto the false prophets.

27. But, unto you, I say, who are hearkening: Be loving your enemies; be doing, good, unto them that hate you;

28. Be blessing them that curse you; be praying for them that wantonly insult you.

29. To him who is smiting thee upon the one cheek, be offering, the other also; and, from him who is taking away thy mantle, thy tunic also, do not forbid:

30. To every one asking thee, give, and, from him that taketh away thy possessions, ask them not back.

31. And, according as ye desire that men be doing unto you, be ye doing unto them, in like manner.

32. And, if ye love them that love you, what sort of thanks are there for you? for, even sinners, love, such as love them.

33.  For , if ye even do good unto them that do good unto you, what sort of thanks are there for you? Even sinners, the same, are doing.

34. And, if ye lend to them from whom ye are hoping to receive, what sort of thanks are there for you? Even sinners, unto sinners, do lend, that they may receive back, as much.

35. But love your enemies, and do good and lend, hoping for, nothing, back; and your reward shall be, great, and ye shall be sons of the Most High,for, he, is, gracious, unto the ungrateful and wicked.

36. Become ye compassionate, according as, your Father, is, compassionate;

37. And do not judge, and in nowise shall ye be judged; and do not condemn, and in nowise shall ye be condemned; release, and ye shall be released;

38. Give, and it shall be given unto you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will they give into your lap; for, with what measure ye mete, shall it be measured back unto you.

39. He spake, moreover, a parable also, unto them: Can, the blind, guide, the blind? will not, both, fall into, a ditch?

40. A disciple is not above the teacher; but, when trained, every one shall be as his teacher.

41. But why beholdest thou the mote that is in the eye of thy brother, while, the beam that is in thine own eye, thou dost not consider?

42. How canst thou say to thy brotherBrother! let me cast out the mote that is in thine eye,thyself, the beam in thine own eye, not beholding? Hypocrite! cast out, first, the beam out of thine own eye, and, then, shalt thou see clearly, to cast out, the mote that is in the eye of thy brother.

43. For a good tree doth not produce worthless fruit, neither again doth, a worthless tree, produce good fruit.

44. For, every tree, by its own fruit, becometh known. For not, of thorns, do they gather figs, neither, of a bramble-bush, do they gather, a bunch of grapes.

45. The good man, out of the good treasure of the heart, bringeth forth that which is good; and, the wicked man, out of the wicked heart, bringeth forth that which is wicked; for, out of an overflowing of heart, speaketh, his mouth.

46. And why call ye me, Lord! Lord! and not do the things that I say?

47. Every one coming unto me, and hearkening unto my words, and doing them, I will suggest to you, whom he is like:

48. He is like unto a man building a house, who digged, and deepened, and laid a foundation upon the rock,and, a flood, coming, the stream burst against that house, and was not strong enough to shake it, because it had been, well, built.

49. But, he that hath heard and not done, is like unto a man having built a house upon the earth, without a foundation,against which the stream burst, and, straightway, it fell in; and it came to pass, that, the crash of that house, was, great.

## Luke 7

1. After he had completed all his sayings within the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum.

2. And, a certain centurions servant, being sick, was on the point of dying,who was, by him, highly prized.

3. But, hearing about Jesus, he sent forth unto him elders of the Jews, requesting him that he would come and bring his servant safely through.

4. And, they, coming near unto Jesus, began beseeching him earnestly, sayingWorthy, is he for whom thou mayest do this,

5. for he loveth our nation, and, the synagogue, he, built for us.

6. And, Jesus, was journeying with them. But, he, by this time, being not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying unto himLord! do not trouble thyself, for I am of no consideration, that, under my roof, thou shouldst enter.

7. Wherefore, neither deemed I, myself, worthy to come unto thee,but speak with a word, and let my servant be healed.

8. For, I too, am a man ranked, under authority, having, under myself, soldiers; and I say to this oneGo! and he goeth,and to anotherCome! and he cometh,and to my servantDo this! and he doeth it.

9. And, hearing these things, Jesus marvelled at him; and, turning to the multitude following him, saidI tell you, Not even in Israel, such faith as this, have I found!

10. And they who were sent, returning unto the house, found the servant, well.

11. And it came to pass thereafter, that he journeyed unto a city called Nain, and there were journeying with him, his disciples and a great multitude.

12. Now, as he drew near unto the gate of the city, then lo! there was being brought forth, one dead, the only-begotten son of his mother,and, she, was a widow; and, a considerable multitude of the city, was with her.

13. And, beholding her, the Lord, was moved with compassion over her, and said to herBe not weeping!

14. And, going forward, he touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still; and he saidYoung man! to thee, I say, Arise!

15. And the dead man sat up, and began to speak; and he gave him to his mother.

16. And fear seized them, all, and they began to glorify God, sayingA great prophet, hath been raised up amongst us! andGod hath visited his people!

17. And this report went forth throughout the whole of Judaea, and all the surrounding country.

18. And Johns disciples carried tidings unto him concerning all these things.

19. And, calling unto him certain two of his disciples, John sent unto the Lord, sayingArt, thou, the Coming One, or, a different one, are we to expect?

20. And, coming near unto him, the men saidJohn the Immerser, hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art, thou, the Coming One, or, another, are we to expect?

21. In that very hour, he cured many from diseases, and plagues, and wicked spirits; and, unto many blind, gave he the favour to see.

22. And, answering, he said unto themGo and bear tidings unto John, as to what ye have seen and heard: The blind, are receiving sight, the lame, walk, lepers, are cleansed, and, the deaf, hear, the dead, are raised, the destitute, are told the glad-message;

23. And, happy, is he, whosoever shall not find occasion of stumbling in me!

24. And, the messengers having departed, he began to say unto the multitudes, concerning JohnWhat went ye forth into the desert to gaze at? A reed, by a wind, shaken?

25. But what went ye forth to see? A man, in soft garments, arrayed? Lo! they who in splendid apparel and luxury are found, are, in the kingly courts.

26. But what went ye forth to see? A prophet? Yea! I say unto you,and abundantly more than a prophet.

27. This, is he concerning whom it is writtenLo! I am sending forth my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.

28. I say unto youA greater, among them that are born of women, than John, is there none; but, he that is least in the kingdom of God, is greater than he.

29. And, all the people, when they heard, and the tax-collectors, justified God, having been immersed with the immersion of John;

30. but, the Pharisees and the lawyers, had set aside, the counsel of God against themselves, not being immersed by him.

31. Unto what, then, shall I liken the men of this generation? And unto what are they like?

32. They are like unto the children sitting, in a market-place, and calling one to another, who sayWe played the flute for you, and ye danced not, We wailed, and ye wept not.

33. For John the Immerser hath come, neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and ye sayA demon, he hath:

34. The Son of Man hath come, eating and drinking, and ye sayLo! a man, gluttonous and a wine-drinker, a friend of tax-collectors and sinners.

35. And yet wisdom hath been justified by all her children.

36. And a certain one of the Pharisees was requesting him, that he would eat with him; and, entering into the house of the Pharisee, he reclined.

37. And, 1o! a woman, who indeed was in the city a sinner; and, when she found out that he was reclining in the house of the Pharisee, providing an alabaster-jar of perfume,

38. and standing behind, near his feet, weeping, with the tears, began she to be wetting his feet, and, with the hair of her head, was wiping off   , and was tenderly kissing his feet, and anointing them with the perfume.

39. But the Pharisee who had invited him, seeing it, spake within himself, saying, This one, if he were the prophet, would have been taking note, who and of what sort, is the woman, who is even touching him, that she is, a sinner.

40. And, making answer, Jesus said unto himSimon! I have, unto thee, something to say. He, thenTeacher, speak!saith he.

41. Two debtors, there were, to a certain creditor,the one, owed five hundred denaries, and, the other, fifty.

42. they not having wherewith to pay, he forgave, both. Which of them, therefore, will love him, more?

43. Making answer, Simon saidI suppose, that he to whom, the more, he forgave. And, he, said unto himRightly, hast thou judged.

44. And, turning towards the woman, unto Simon, he saidSeest thou this woman? I entered into thy house: water to me, on my feet, thou didst not give,but, she, with her tears, hath wetted my feet, and, with her hair, wiped off   .

45. A kiss, to me, thou didst not give,but, she, from the time I came in, hath not ceased tenderly kissing my feet.

46. With oil, my head, thou didst not anoint,but, she, with perfume, hath anointed, my feet.

47. For which cause, I say unto theeHer many sins, have been forgiven, because she hath loved, much: but, he to whom little is forgiven, little, loveth.

48. And he said unto herThy sins have been forgiven.

49. And they who were reclining together, began to be saying within themselvesWho is, this, that, even forgiveth sins?

50. But he said unto the womanThy faith, hath saved thee,Go thy way into peace.

## Luke 8

1. And it came to pass, in due course, that he was passing through, city by city and village by village, proclaiming, and delivering the glad-message of the kingdom of God,and, the twelve, were with him;

2. and certain women, who had been cured from evil spirits and infirmities,Mary, the one called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone forth,

3. and Joana, wife of Chuza steward of Herod, and Susanna, and many others,who indeed were ministering unto them out of their possessions.

4. And, seeing that a great multitude were coming together, and they who from every city were journeying forth unto him, he spake through means of a parable:

5. The sower went forth to sow his seed,and, as he sowed, some, indeed, fell beside the pathway, and was trodden down; and, the birds of heaven, devoured it.

6. And, other, fell down upon the rock; and, growing, was withered, because it had not moisture.

7. And, other, fell and thorns; and, growing together, the thorns, choked it.

8. And, other, fell into good ground; and, growing, brought forth fruit, a hundredfold. These things, saying, he went on to cry aloudHe that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

9. But his disciples began to question himWhat might, this very, parable be?

10. And, he, saidUnto you, hath it been given, to get to know the sacred secrets of the kingdom of God; but, unto the rest, in parables,in order that, seeing, they may not see, and, hearing, they may not understand.

11. Now the parable, is thisThe seed, is, the word of God.

12. And, those beside the pathway, are they who have heard; afterwards, cometh the adversary, and catcheth away the word from their heart, lest, believing, they should, be saved.

13. And, those upon the rock, are they who, as soon as they hear, with joy, welcome the word; and, these, not having, root, are they who, for a season, believe,and, in a season of testing, draw back.

14. And, that which in among the thorns fell, these, are they who have heard; and, by anxieties and wealth and pleasures of life being borne along, are choked up, and bear not to perfection.

15. But, that in the good ground, these, are they who, indeed, in a noble and good heart having heard the word, hold fast, and bear fruit with endurance.

16. And, no one having lit a lamp, covereth it up with a vessel, or, beneath a couch, putteth it; but, upon a lamp-stand, putteth it, that, they who come in, may see the light.

17. For there is no secret, which shall not be made, manifest; neither a hidden thing, which shall in anywise not be made known, or not come, where it can be seen.

18. Be taking heed therefore how ye hear; for, whosoever shall have, it shall be given unto him; and, whosoever shall not have, even what he seemeth to have, shall be taken from him.

19. And his mother and brethren came near unto him, and were unable to reach him, because of the multitude.

20. And it was reported to himThy mother and thy brethren, are standing outside, desiring, to see, thee.

21. But, he, answering, said unto themMy mother and my brethren, are, thesethey who, the word of God, are hearing and doing.

22. And it came to pass, on one of the days, that, he, entered into a boat, and his disciples; and he said unto themLet us pass over unto the other side of the lake. And they set sail.

23. Now, as they were sailing, he fell asleep. And there came down a hurricane of wind upon the lake, and they began to be filled, and to be in peril.

24. And, coming near, they roused him up, sayingMaster! Master! we perish! And, he, roused up, rebuked the wind, and the surging of the water; and they ceased, and it became a calm.

25. And he said unto themWhere was your faith? But, struck with fear, they marvelled, saying one to anotherWho then is, this,that, even unto the winds, he giveth orders, and unto the water, and they hearken unto him.

26. And they sailed down into the country of the Gerasenes, the which is over against Galilee.

27. And, when he went forth upon the land, there met him a certain man, out of the city, having demons; and, for a considerable time, he had put on no garment, and, in a house, would not abide, but among the tombs.

28. But, seeing Jesus, he cried out aloud, and fell down before him, and, with a loud voice, saidWhat have I in common with thee, O Jesus, Son of  God  the Most High? I beg of theeDo not torment me!

29. for he was about to charge the impure spirit to come out from the man. For, many times, had it snatched him away; and he used to be bound with chains and fetters, for a safe-guard, and was wont to break in pieces the bonds, and to be driven by the demon into the deserts.

30. And Jesus questioned himWhat name hast thou? And, he, saidLegion! because many demons had entered into him.

31. And they were beseeching him that he would not order them, into the abyss, to depart.

32. Now there was there, a herd of a good many swine, feeding in the mountain; and they besought him, that he would suffer them, into those, to enter; and he suffered them.

33. And the demons, going forth from the man entered into the swine; and the herd rushed down the cliff, into the lake, and were choked.

34. And they who had been feeding them, seeing what had happened, fled, and carried tidings into the city, and into the country-places.

35. And they went forth to see what had happened; and came unto Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone forth, sitting, clothed, and of sound mind, near the feet of Jesus,and they were struck with fear.

36. And they who had seen it, reported unto them, how the demonized man was saved.

37. And one and all of the throng of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes, requested him, to depart from them; because, with a great fear, were they oppressed. And, he, entering into a boat, returned.

38. And the man from whom the demons had gone forth, began to beg of him, that he might be with him; but he dismissed him, saying

39. Be returning unto thy house, and telling forth what great things, God, for thee, hath done. And he departed, through all the city, proclaiming what great things, Jesus, had done for him.

40. Now, when Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him back, for they were all expecting him.

41. And lo! there came a man, whose name was Jairus, and, the same, was, a ruler of the synagogue,and, falling down near the feet of Jesus, he began beseeching him to enter into his house;

42. because he had, an only-begotten daughter, about twelve years old, and, she, was dying. Now, as he withdrew, the multitudes, were hemming him in.

43. And, a woman, with a flow of blood of twelve years standing, who indeed could, from no one, be cured,

44. coming near behind, touched the fringe of his mantle; and, instantly, was stayed the flow of her blood.

45. And Jesus saidWho, is it that touched me? And, when all were denying, Peter saidMaster! the multitudes, are hemming thee in, and pressing along.

46. But, Jesus, saidSome one touched me, for, I, took note of power, gone out from me.

47. And, the woman seeing that she had not escaped notice, trembling, came, and, falling down before him, reported before all the people, for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed instantly!

48. And, he, said to herDaughter! thy faith, hath saved thee: Go thy way into peace.

49. While yet he is speaking, there cometh one from the synagogue rulers, sayingThy daughter, is dead: No further, be troubling the teacher.

50. But, Jesus, hearing, answered himDo not fear! Only believe, and she shall be saved.

51. And, when he came into the house, he suffered no one to enter with him, save Peter and John and James, and the father of the girl, and the mother.

52. And they were all weeping, and beating themselves, for her. And he saidBe not weeping; for she died not, but is sleeping.

53. And they were deriding him, knowing that she died.

54. But, he, grasping her hand, called aloud, sayingO girl! arise!

55. And her spirit returned, and she rose up instantly, and he ordered that something should be given her to eat.

56. And her parents were beside themselves. But, he, charged them to tell, no one, what had happened.

## Luke 9

1. And, calling together the twelve, he gave them power and authority over all the demons, and to be curing, diseases;

2. and sent them forth, to be proclaiming the kingdom of God, and to be healing;

3. and said unto themNothing, take ye for the journey,neither staff, nor satchel, nor bread, nor silver, nor to have, two tunics.

4. And, into whatsoever house ye enter, there, abide, and, thence, be going forth.

5. And, as many soever as shall not welcome you, in going forth from that city, the dust of your feet, shake ye off, for a witness against them.

6. And they went forth, and were passing through, along the villages,delivering the glad-message, and effecting cures in every direction.

7. Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things which were coming to pass, and was utterly at a loss, because of its being said, by some, that, John, had been raised from the dead;

8. and, by some, that, Elijah, had appeared; and, by others, that, some prophet of the ancients, had arisen.

9. But Herod saidJohn, I myself, beheaded; but, who is this, concerning whom I am hearing such things as these? And he was seeking to see him.

10. And the Apostles, returning, related to him what great things they had done. And, taking them aside, he retired privately, into a city called Bethsaida.

11. But, the multitudes, getting to know, followed him; and, giving them welcome, he began speaking unto them concerning the kingdom of God,and, them that had need of cure, he healed,

12. And, the day, began to decline; and the twelve, coming near, said to himDismiss the multitude, that, going into the surrounding villages and hamlets, they may lodge, and find provisions; because, here, in a desert place, are we.

13. But he said unto themGive, ye, them to eat. They, however, saidWe have not more than five loaves, and two fishes,unless perhaps, we, should go, and buy food, for all this people.

14. For there were about five thousand men. And he said unto his disciplesMake them recline, in companies of about fifty each.

15. And they did so,and made, one and all, recline.

16. And, taking the five loaves, and the two fishes, looking up into heaven, he blessed them, and brake   up, and went on giving to the disciples, to set before the multitude;

17. and they did all eat and were filled. And that which remained over to them, was taken up,of broken pieces, twelve baskets.

18. And, it came to pass, when he was praying in solitude, the disciples, were with him. And he questioned them, sayingWho do the multitudes say that I am?

19. And they, answering, said John the Immerser; But some, Elijah, and others, that, some prophet of the ancients, hath arisen.

20. And he said to themBut who say, ye, that I am? And, Peter, answering, saidThe Christ of God!

21. He, however, sternly admonishing them, gave charge that, unto no one, should they be telling this;

22. sayingThe Son of Man must needs suffer, many things, and be rejected by the Elders and High priests and Scribes, and be slain,and, on the third day, arise.

23. And he was saying, unto allIf any one intendeth after me to come, Let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily,and be following me.

24. For, whosoever intendeth, his life, to save, shall lose it; but, whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same, shall save it?

25. For what doth a man profit, who hath gained the whole world, but hath lost, or been made to forfeit, himself?

26. For, whosoever shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, of him, the Son of Man, will be ashamed, whensoever he shall come in his glory, and that of the Father, and of the holy messengers.

27. But I tell you of a truthThere, are, some of those, here, standing, who shall in nowise taste of death, until they see the kingdom of God.

28. And it came to pass, after these words, about eight days, taking with him Peter and John and James, he went up into the mountain to pray.

29. And it came to pass, while he was praying, that, the appearance of his face, was changed, and, his clothing, became white, effulgent.

30. And lo! two men, were conversing with him, who, indeed, were Moses and Elijah,

31. who, appearing in glory, were speaking as to his departure, which he was about to fulfil in Jerusalem.

32. Now, Peter, and they who were with him, had become heavy with sleep; but, waking up, they saw his glory, and the two men who were standing with him.

33. And it came to pass, when they were being parted from him, Peter said unto JesusMaster! it is, delightful, for us to be, here: Let us, therefore, make three tents, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah:not knowing what he said.

34. Now, while he was saying these things, there came a cloud, and it began to overshadow them,and they were overcome with fear as they entered into the cloud.

35. And, a voice, came out of the cloud, sayingThis, is my Son, the Chosen One: Unto him, be hearkening.

36. And, when the voice came, there was found, Jesus alone. And they held their peace, and, unto no one, reported they, in those days, any of the things which they had seen.

37. And it came to pass, on the next day, when they came down from the mountain, that there met him a great multitude.

38. And lo! a man from the multitude, uttered a cry, sayingTeacher! I beg of thee, to look upon my son, because, my only begotten, he is.

39. And lo! a spirit, taketh him, and, suddenly, he crieth out,and it convulseth himwith foaming, and with difficulty departeth from him, sorely bruising him.

40. And I begged of thy disciples, that they would cast it out, and they could not.

41. And, making answer, Jesus saidO faithless and perverted generation! how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? Bring, hither, thy son.

42. And, while yet he was coming, the demon tare him, and mangled him. But Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.

43. And they were all being struck with astonishment, at the majesty of God. And, while all were marvelling at all things which he was doing, he said unto his disciples:

44. Lay, ye, up in your ears, these words; for, the Son of Man, is about to be delivered up, into the hands of men.

45. But, they, understood not this saying, and it had become veiled from them, that they might not grasp it,and they were afraid to question him, concerning this saying.

46. But there entered a reasoning among them, as to who of them should be greatest.

47. And, Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their heart, taking a child, placed it near himself,

48. and said unto themWhosoever shall give welcome unto this child, on my name, unto me, giveth welcome; and, whosoever, unto me, giveth welcome, giveth welcome unto him that sent me forth. For, he who is least among you all, the same, is, great.

49. But John, answering, saidMaster! we saw some one, in thy name, casting out demons,and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us.

50. And Jesus said unto himDo not forbid; for, whosoever is not against you, is, for you.

51. And it came to pass, when the days for taking him up were on the point of being fulfilled, even he himself, set, his face, to be journeying unto Jerusalem;

52. and he sent messengers before his face,and, taking their journey, they entered into a village of Samaritans, so as to prepare for him.

53. And they welcomed him not, because, his face, was for journeying unto Jerusalem.

54. And the disciples James and John, seeing it, saidLord! wilt thou, that we bid fire come down from heaven, and destroy them?

55. But, turning, he rebuked them.

56. And they journeyed into a different village.

57. And, as they were journeying on the road, one said unto himI will follow thee, whithersoever thou shalt depart.

58. And Jesus said unto himthe foxes, have, dens, and, the birds of heaven, nests; but, the Son of Man, hath not where, his head, he may recline.

59. And he said unto anotherBe following me! But, he, saidSuffer me, first, to depart, and bury my father.

60. And he said unto himLeave, the dead, to bury their own dead; but, thou, departing, be declaring the kingdom of God.

61. And, yet another, saidI will follow thee, Lord; But, first, suffer me to bid adieu to them that are in my house.

62. But Jesus said

## Luke 10

1. And, after these things, the Lord appointed seventy two others, and sent them forth, two and two before his face, into every city and place whither, he himself, was about to come.

2. And he was saying unto themThe harvest, indeed, is, great, but, the labourers, few; beg ye, therefore, of the Lord of the harvest, that he would thrust forth, labourers, into his harvest.

3. Withdraw! Lo! I send you forth as lambs amid wolves.

4. Be not carrying purse, or satchel, or sandals, and, no one along the road, salute ye;

5. And, into whatsoever house ye enter, First, say, Peace to this house!

6. And, if the son of peace be, there, your peace, shall rest upon it; but, otherwise, at least, unto you, shall it return.

7. And, in the self-same house, abide ye, eating and drinking such things as they have; for, worthy, is the labourer, of his hire: be not removing from house to house.

8. And, into whatsoever city ye shall enter, and they bid you welcome, be eating such things as are set before you;

9. And be curing the sick that are, therein, and be saying unto themThe kingdom of God hath drawn nigh upon you.

10. But, into whatsoever city ye shall enter, and they do not welcome you, going forth into the broadways thereof, say ye:

11. Even the dust that cleaveth unto us, out of your city, unto our feet, do we wipe off against you; nevertheless, of this, be taking noticeThe kingdom of God hath drawn near.

12. I tell you, for them of Sodom, in that day, more tolerable, will it be, than for that city.

13. Alas for thee, Chorazin! Alas for thee, Bethsaida! Because, if, in Tyre and Zidon, had been done the works of power which have been down in you, of old, in sackcloth and ashes sitting, they would have repented.

14. Moreover, for Tyre and Zidon, more tolerable, will it be, in the judgment, than, for you.

15. And, thou, Capernaum,Unto heaven, shalt thou be uplifted? Unto hades, thou shalt be brought down!

16. He that hearkeneth unto you, unto me, doth hearken, and, he that setteth you aside, doth set, me, aside; and, he that setteth, me, aside, doth set aside, him that sent me.

17. And the seventy  -two  returned, with joy, sayingLord! even the demons, submit themselves unto us, in thy name!

18. And he said unto themI was beholding Satan, when, like lightning, out of heaven, he fell!

19. Lo! I have given you the authorityto be treading upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and, nothing, unto you, shall in anywise do harm;

20. Notwithstanding, in this, be not rejoicingthat, the spirits, unto you submit themselves; but be rejoicingthat, your names, are inscribed in the heavens!

21. In the self-same hour, exulted he in the Holy Spirit, and saidI openly give praise unto thee, Father! Lord of heaven and earth! in that thou hast hid these things from the wise and discerning, and hast revealed them unto babes,Yea, O Father! that, so, hath it become, a delight, before thee.

22. All things, unto me, have been delivered up by my Father; and, no one, knoweth, who the Son is, save the Father,and who the Father is, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son may be minded to reveal him.

23. And, turning unto his disciples, privately, he saidHappy, the eyes, that see what ye see!

24. For I tell you, Many prophets and kings, have desired to see what, ye, see, and they saw not, and to hear what ye hear, and they heard not.

25. And lo! a certain lawyer, arose, putting him to the test, sayingTeacher! by doing what, shall I inherit, life age-abiding?

26. And, he, said unto himIn the law, what is written? how dost thou read?

27. And, he, answering, saidThou shalt love the Lord thy God, out of all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might, and with all thine intention; and thy neighbour, as thyself?

28. And he said unto himRightly, hast thou answered: This, do, and thou shalt live.

29. But, he, wishing to justify himself, said unto JesusAnd, who is, my, neighbour?

30. And taking up   , Jesus saidA certain man, was going down from Jerusalem unto Jericho, and, with robbers, fell in,who, stripping him, and inflicting, wounds, upon him, departed, leaving him, half dead.

31. And, by chance, a certain priest, was coming down by that road, and, seeing him, passed by, on the opposite side.

32. And, in like manner, a Levite also, coming down to the place, and seeing him, passed by, on the opposite side.

33. But, a certain Samaritan, going on his journey, came down to him, and, seeing him, was moved with compassion;

34. and, coming near, bound up his bruises, pouring thereon oil and wine,and, setting him on his own beast, brought him into an inn, and took care of him.

35. And, on the morrow, throwing out two denaries, he gave them to the inn-keeper, and saidTake care of him, and, whatsoever thou shall further spend, I, when on my way back, will duly pay thee.

36. Which of these three, seemeth unto thee to have become, neighbour, unto him who fell among the robbers?

37. And, he, saidHe who dealt mercifully with him. And Jesus said unto himBe taking thy journey, and, thou, be doing, in like manner.

38. And, as they were journeying, he, entered into a certain village; and, a certain woman, named Martha, welcomed him into her house.

39. And, she, had a sister, called Mary, who also, seating herself at the feet of the Lord, was hearing his word.

40. But, Martha, was distracted about much ministering, and, coming near, saidLord! carest thou not that, my sister, hath left me to be ministering, alone? Speak to her, then, that she help me.

41. But the Lord, answering, said to herMartha! Martha! thou art anxious and troubled about many things:

42. Of few things, is there need, or, of one; Mary, in fact, hath chosen, the good part,one which shall not be taken away from her.

## Luke 11

1. And it came to pass, when he was in a certain place praying, as he ceased, one of his disciples said unto himLord! teach us to pray, as, John also, taught his disciples.

2. And he said unto themWhensoever ye are praying, sayFather! Hallowed be thy name, Come may thy kingdom,

3. Our needful bread, be giving us, day by day;

4. And forgive us our sins, for, even we ourselves, forgive every one indebted to us; And bring us not into temptation.

5. And he said unto themWho from among you, shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto himFriend! supply me with three loaves,

6. forasmuch as, a friend of mine, hath come off a journey unto me, and I have not what I can set before him;

7. and, he, from within, shall answer, and sayBe not disturbing me,already, the door hath been fastened, and, my children, with me, are, in bed: I cannot rise and give thee?

8. I say unto youEven though he will not give him, rising because of his being a friend of his, because, at least, of his importunity, he will rouse himself, and give him as many as he needeth.

9. I, therefore, unto you, sayBe asking, and it shall be given to you, Be seeking, and ye shall find,Be knocking, and it shall be opened unto you.

10. For, whosoever asketh, receiveth, and, he that seeketh, findeth,and, to him that knocketh, shall it be opened.

11. But which is the father, from among yourselves, whom the son will ask for, a fish, who, instead of a fish, will give him, a serpent?

12. Or shall also ask, an egg, who will give him, a scorpion?

13. If therefore, ye, being, evil, know how to be giving, good gifts, unto your children, how much rather, will, the heavenly Father, give Holy Spirit unto them that ask him!

14. And he was casting out a demon that was dumb; and it came to pass, when the demon went out, the dumb began speaking. And the multitudes marvelled;

15. but, some from among them, saidIn Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons, is he casting out the demons;

16. and, others, putting him to the test, a sign out of heaven, were seeking from him.

17. But, he, knowing their thoughts, said unto themEvery kingdom, against itself divided, is laid waste, and, a house, against a house,   , falleth;

18. And, if, even Satan, against himself hath become divided, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye are saying that, in Beelzebul, am I casting out the demons.

19. But, if, I, in Beelzebul, am casting out the demons, In whom are, your sons, casting them out? Wherefore, they, shall be, your judges.

20. But, if, with the finger of God, I, am casting out the demons, then doubtless unawares hath come upon you, the kingdom of God.

21. Whensoever, the mighty one, armed, may be guarding his own dwelling, in peace, are his goods;

22. But, whensoever, a mightier than he, shall come upon and vanquish him, his panoply, he taketh away, wherein he was trusting, and, his spoils, he distributeth.

23. He that is not with me, is, against me; and, he that gathereth not with me, scattereth.

24. Whensoever, the impure spirit, goeth out from the man, it passeth through waterless places, seeking rest; and, not finding it,  then,  it saith, I will return unto my house, whence I came out;

25. and, coming, findeth it,  empty,  swept, and adorned.

26. Then, goeth it, and taketh along with itself, other spirits, more wicked than itselfseven, and, entering in, fixeth its dwelling there; and, the last state of that man, becometh, worse than the first.

27. Now it came to pass, while he was saying these things, that a certain woman out of the multitude, lifting up her voice, said unto himHappy the womb that bare thee! And the breasts which thou didst suck!

28. But, he, saidYea rather!Happy they who hear the word of God, and observe it!

29. And, as the multitudes were thronging together, he began to be sayingThis generation, is, a wicked generation: A sign, it is seeking, and, a sign, shall not be given it, save the sign of Jonah.

30. For, according as, Jonah, became, unto the Ninevites, a sign, so, shall be, the Son of Man also, unto this generation.

31. The queen of the south, will rise up, in the judgment, with the men of this generation, and will condemn them; because she came out of the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon,and lo! something more than Solomon, here.

32. Men of Nineveh, will rise up, in the judgment, with this generation, and will condemn it; because they repented into the proclamation of Jonah,and lo! something more than Jonah, here.

33. No one, having lighted, a lamp, into a covered place, a putteth it, nor, under the measure; but upon the lampstand, that they who enter may see, the light.

34. The lamp of thy body, is thine eye: Whensoever, thine eye, may be, single, even the whole of thy body, is, lighted up; but, whensoever it may be, useless, even thy body, is darkened.

35. Be looking to it, therefore, lest, the light that is in thee, be, darkness.

36. If, therefore, thy whole body, is lighted up, not having any part darkened, the whole, shall be lighted up, as whensoever, the lamp, with its radiance, may be giving thee light.

37. And, when he had spoken, a Pharisee was requesting him that he would dine with him; and, entering, he reclined.

38. And, the Pharisee, beholding, marvelled that he was not, first, immersed, before the dinner.

39. And the Lord said unto him: Now, ye, the Pharisees, the outside of the cup and of the tray, do make pure; but, your inward part, is full of plunder and wickedness.

40. Simple ones! Did not, he who made the outside, the inside also, make?

41. Notwithstanding, as to the things within, give alms, and lo! everything, is, pure unto you.

42. But alas for you, the Pharisees! because ye tithe the mint, and the rue, and every garden herb, and pass by justice, and the love of God. But, these things, it was biding to do, and, those, not to pass by.

43. Alas for you, the Pharisees! because ye love the first seats in the synagogues, and the salutations in the market-places!

44. Alas for you! because ye are as the secret tombs: even the men that are walking above them, know it not.

45. And, making answer, one of the Lawyers saith unto him, Teacher! these things, saying, us also, dost thou insult!

46. And, he, saidAnd, for you, the lawyers, alas! because ye lade men with burdens hard to be borne, and, yourselves, with one of your fingers, touch not the burdens.

47. Alas for you! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers slew them!

48. Hence, witnesses, are ye, and find consenting pleasure in the works of your fathers: because, they, indeed, slew them, and, ye, are building,   .

49. For this cause, the Wisdom of God hath saidI will send forth, unto them, prophets and apostles,and, some from among them, will they slay, and,   persecute:

50. That the blood of all the prophets which hath been shed from the foundation of the world, may be sought out, from this generation,

51. From the blood of Abel, unto the blood of Zachariah who was destroyed betwixt the altar and the house; Yea! I say unto youIt shall be sought out from this generation.

52. Alas for you, the lawyers! because ye took away the key of knowledge: yourselves, entered not, and, them who were entering, ye hindered.

53. And, when, from thence, he came out, the Scribes and the Pharisees began, with vehemence, to be hemming him in, and trying to make him speak off-hand concerning many things,

54. lying in wait for him, to catch something out of his mouth.

## Luke 12

1. Amongst which things, when the ten thousands of the multitude were gathered together, so that they were treading one upon another, he began to be saying, unto his disciples, firstBe keeping yourselves free from the leaven of the Pharisees, the which is, hypocrisy.

2. But, nothing, hath been, covered up, which shall not be uncovered, and hidden, which shall not be made known.

3. Because, as many things as, in the darkness, ye have said, in the light, shall be heard; and, what to the ear ye spake, in the chambers, shall be proclaimed on the housetops.

4. And I say unto you, my friendsDo not be put in fear of them who kill the body, and, after these things, have nothing more uncommon which they can do.

5. But I will suggest to you, whom ye should fearFear him who, after killing, hath authority to cast into gehenna,Yea, I say unto youHim, fear ye.

6. Are not, five sparrows, sold for two farthings? and, not one from among them, hath been forgotten before God.

7. But, even the hairs of your head, have all been numbered: Be not afraid: many sparrows, ye excel.

8. And I say unto youWhosoever shall confess me before men, even the Son of Man, will confess him, before the messengers of God;

9. But, he who denied me before men, shall be denied before the messengers of God.

10. And, whosoever shall say a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but, unto him who, against the Holy Spirit, speaketh profanely, it shall not be forgiven.

11. But, whensoever they shall be bringing you in before the synagogues, and the rulers, and the authorities, do not be anxious how,  or what  ye shall answer, or what ye shall say;

12. For, the Holy Spirit, shall teach you, in that very hour, what ye ought to say.

13. And one from amongst the multitude said unto himTeacher! bid my brother divide with me the inheritance.

14. But, he, said unto himMan! who hath appointed me a judge or divider over you?

15. And he said unto themMind and be guarding yourselves from all covetousness; for not, in ones abundance, doth his life spring out of his possessions.

16. And he spake a parable unto them, sayingA certain rich mans estate, bare well.

17. And he began to deliberate within himself, sayingWhat shall I do? because I have not where I can gather my fruits.

18. And he saidThis, will I do,I will pull down my barns, and, greater ones, build, and gather, there, all my wheat and good things;

19. and will say to my soulSoul! thou hast many good things  lying by for many years: be taking thy rest, eat, drink,  be making merry!

20. But God said unto himSimple one! on this very night, they are asking, thy soul, from thee; The things, then, which thou hast prepared, whose shall they be?

21.  So, is he that is laying up treasure for himself, and is not rich, towards God.

22. And he said unto his disciplesFor this cause, I say unto you,Be not anxious for the life, what ye shall eat, nor yet for  your  body, what ye shall put on;

23. For, the life, is more, than the food, and, the body, than, the clothing.

24. Consider well the ravensThat they sow nor, neither do they reap, which have neither chamber nor barn,and, God, feedeth, them! By how much do, ye, excel, the birds?

25. And, who from among you, though anxious, can, unto his stature, add a cubit?

26. If then, not even the least thing, ye can do, why, concerning the rest, are ye anxious?

27. Consider well the lilies, how they grow: they toil not, neither do they spin, and yet I say unto youNot even Solomon, in all his glory, was arrayed like one of these.

28. But, if God thus adorneth, the grass, which is, in a field, to-day, and, to-morrow, into an oven, is cast, how much rather you, O little-of-faith?

29. Ye, therefore, be not seeking what ye shall eat and what ye shall drink, and be not held in suspense;

30. For, after all these things, do, the nations of the world, seek,but, your Father, knoweth that ye need these things.

31. Notwithstanding, be seeking his kingdom,and, these things, shall be added unto you.

32. Be not afraid, the dear little flock! for your Father delighteth to give you, the kingdom.

33. Sell your possessions, and give alms, make for yourselves purses that wax not old,treasure unfailing, in the heavens, where, thief, doth not draw near, and, moth, doth not spoil.

34. For, where your treasure is, there, will your heart he also.

35. Let your loins be girded, and your lamps burning,

36. And, ye yourselves, like unto men awaiting their own lord, once he may break up out of the marriage-feast,that, when he cometh and knocketh, straightway, they may open unto him.

37. Happy those servants, whom the lord, when he cometh, shall find watching! Verily, I say unto youhe will gird himself, and make them recline, and, coming near, will minister unto them.

38. And, if, in the second, or if, in the third, watch, he come and find, thus, happy, are, they!

39. But, of this, be taking noteHad the householder known, in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not suffered his house, to be digged through.

40. Ye, therefore, be getting ready, because, in what hour ye are not thinking, The Son of an cometh!

41. But Peter saidLord! unto us, this parable, speakest thou? or, even unto all?

42. And the Lord saidWho then is the faithful steward, the prudent one, whom the lord will appoint over his body of attendants, to be giving, in due season, the measured allowance of wheat?

43. Happy, that servant, whom the lord, when he cometh shall find doing, thus!

44. Of a truth, I say unto youOver all his possessions, will he appoint him.

45. But, if that servant should say in his heartMy lord delayeth to come! and should begin to be striking the youths and the maidens,to be eating also, and drinking, and making himself drunk,

46. The lord of that servant, will have comeon a day when he is not expecting, and in an hour when he is not taking note,and will cut him asunder, and, his part, with the unfaithful, will appoint.

47. And, that servant, who had come to know the will of his lord, and neither prepared, nor wrought unto his will, shall be beaten with many stripes;

48. Whereas, he who had not come to know, and did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. And, every one to whom was given much, much, shall be sought from him; and, he to whom they committed much, for more than common, will they ask him.

49. Fire, came I to cast upon the earth,and what can I wish, if, already, it hath been, kindled?

50. But, an immersion, have I, to be immersed with, and how am I distressed, until it be ended!

51. Suppose ye, that, peace, I am come to give in the earth? Nay, I tell you, but rather division.

52. For there shall be, henceforth, five in one house, divided,three against two, and two against three:

53. There shall be dividedFather against son, and son against father, mother against daughter, and daughter against the mother,mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law.

54. And he went on to say, even unto the multitudes,Whensoever ye see a cloud springing up from the west, straightway, ye are sayingA thunderstorm is coming! and it happeneth thus.

55. And, whensoever a south wind, blowing, ye sayA scorching heat, will there be! and it cometh to pass.

56. Hypocrites! the face of the earth and of the heaven, ye know how to scan; but, this season, how know ye not to scan;

57. Why, moreover, even from yourselves, judge ye not what is just?

58. For, as thou art going along with thine adversary unto a ruler, on the way, take pains to get a release from him; lest once he drag thee along unto the judge, and, the judge, deliver thee up to the punisher,and, the punisher, cast thee into prison:

59. I tell theeIn nowise shalt thou come out from thence, until, even the last fraction, thou pay!

## Luke 13

1. Now there were present some, in that very season, bringing tidings to him, concerning the Galilaeans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.

2. And, answering, he said unto themSuppose ye, that, these Galilaeans, had become, sinners beyond all the Galilaeans, because, these things, they have suffered?

3. Nay! I tell you, but, except ye repent, ye, all, in like manner, shall perish.

4. Or, those eighteen, upon whom fell the tower in Siloam, and slew them, suppose ye that, they, had become, debtors, beyond all the men who were dwelling in Jerusalem?

5. Nay! I tell you, but, except ye repent, ye, all, in the same way, shall perish.

6. And he went on to speak this parable:A certain man had, a fig-tree, planted in his vineyard, and he canto seeking fruit therein, and found none.

7. And he said unto the vine-dresserLo! three years, I come, seeking fruit in this fig-tree, and find none. Cut it down! Why doth it make, even the round useless?

8. And, he, answering, saith unto himSir! let it alone this year also, until such time as I dig about it, and throw in manure,

9. and if it may bear fruit for the future; but, otherwise, certainly, thou shalt cut it down.

10. And he was teaching in one of the synagogues, on the Sabbath.

11. And lo! a woman, having a spirit of weakness eighteen years,and was bowed together, and unable to lift herself up, at all.

12. And, seeing her, Jesus called her and said to herWoman! thou art loosed from thy weakness,

13. and laid on her his hands; and, instantly, she was made straight again, and began glorifying God.

14. But the synagogue-ruler, answering, being greatly displeased that, on the Sabbath, Jesus had healed, began saying unto the multitudeSix days, there are, in which men ought to get their work done; On them, therefore, come and be healed, and, not on the day of rest.

15. The Lord answered him, and saidHypocrites! Doth not, each one of you, on the Sabbath, loose his ox or ass from the manger, and, leading it away, give it drink?

16. But, this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound, lo! eighteen years, was there not a needs-be that she should be loosed from this bond, on the day of rest?

17. And, as he was saying, these, things, all who had been setting themselves against him were being put to shame; and, all the multitude, were rejoicing over all the glorious things which were being brought to pass by him.

18. He went on to say, thereforeWhereunto, is the kingdom of God, like? And, whereunto, shall I liken it?

19. It is, like, unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and cast into his own garden; and it grew, and became a tree, and, the birds of heaven, lodged amongst its branches.

20. And, again, he saidWhereunto, shall I liken the kingdom of God?

21. It is, like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until, the whole, was leavened.

22. And he was journeying on, city by city and village by village, and making, progress, unto Jerusalem.

23. And one said unto himLord! are they, few, who are being saved? And, he, said unto them

24. Be striving to enter through the narrow door; for, many, I say unto you, will seek to enter, and will not be able,

25. when once the householder shall rouse himself, and lock the door, and ye begin to stand, outside, and to knock at the door, sayingLord! open to us; and he shall answer and say unto youI know you not, whence ye are.

26. Then, will ye begin to sayWe did eat and drink in thy presence, and, in our broadways, thou didst, teach;

27. And he will speak, saying unto youI know not whence ye are; Depart from me, all workers of unrighteous

28. There, will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, as soon as ye see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and, yourselves, being thrust forth outside.

29. And they shall have come from east and west, and from north and south, and be made recline in the kingdom of God.

30. And lo! there are, last, who shall be, first, and there are, first, who shall be, last;

31. In that very hour, came near certain Pharisees, saying unto him, Go forth, and be journeying hence, because, Herod, desireth to slay thee.

32. And he said unto themGo and tell this fox, Lo! I am casting out demons, and, cures, am I finishing, to-day, and to-morrow,

33. and, on the third, I am to be made perfect. Nevertheless, I must needs, to-day, and tomorrow, and the following, be journeying on, because it is impossible that a prophet perish, outside Jerusalem.

34. Jerusalem! Jerusalem! she that slayeth the prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto her! How often, have I desired to gather together thy children, like as a hen, her own brood, under her wings,and ye did not desire!

35. Lo! your house is left to you.  And  I say unto youIn nowise shall ye see me, until ye say,Blessed, is he that cometh in the name of the Lord!

## Luke 14

1. And it came to pass, when he entered into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees, on a Sabbath, to eat bread, that, they, were narrowly watching him.

2. And lo! there was, a certain man, who had the dropsy, before him.

3. And Jesus, answering, spake unto the Lawyers and Pharisees, sayingIs it allowed, on the Sabbath, to cure, or not? But, they, held their peace.

4. And taking hold   he healed and dismissed him,

5. and, unto them, saidWhich of you, shall have a son or an ox that, into a pit, shall fall, and will not straightway pull him up, on the day of rest?

6. And they could not return an answer unto these things.

7. And he went on to speak, unto the invited, a parable,observing how, the first couches, they were choosing; saying unto them

8. Whensoever thou hast been invited by anyone unto a marriage feast, do not recline on the first couch; lest once, a more honourable than thou, have been invited by him,

9. and he that invited both thee and him should come, and say unto theeGive, unto this one, place! and, then, thou shouldst begin, with shame, the last place, to occupy.

10. But, whensoever thou hast been invited, pass on and fall back into the last place, that, whensoever he that hath invited thee shall come, he may say unto theeFriend! come close up, higher. Then, shalt thou have honour before all who are reclining together with thee.

11. Because, everyone who exalteth himself, shall be abased; and, he that abaseth himself, shall be exalted?

12. Moreover he went on to say, unto him also who had invited him,Whensoever thou mayest be making a dinner or a supper, do not call thy friends, or thy brothers, or thy kinsfolk, or rich neighbours,lest once, they also, invite thee in return, and it become a recompense unto thee.

13. But, whensoever, an entertainment, thou mayest be making, invite the destitute, the tried, the lame, the blind;

14. and, happy, shalt thou be, that they have not wherewith to recompense thee, for it shall be recompensed unto thee, in the resurrection of the righteous.

15. And one of those reclining together, hearing these things, said unto himHappy, whoever shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!

16. But, he, said unto himA certain man, was making a great supper, and invited many;

17. and he sent out his servant, at the hour of the supper, to say unto the invitedBe coming! because, even now, is it, ready.

18. And they all began, one after another to excuse themselves. The first, said unto himA field, have I bought, and have need to go out and see it: I request thee, hold me excused.

19. And, another, saidFive yoke of oxen, have I bought, and am going my way to prove them; I request thee, hold me excused.

20. And, another, saidA wife, have I married, and, for this cause, I cannot come!

21. And, going near, the servant reported unto his lord these things. Then, provoked to anger, the master of the house said unto his servantGo out quickly, into the broadways and streets of the city,and, the destitute, and tried, and blind, and lame, bring thou in here.

22. And the servant saidLord! what thou didst order, hath been done; and, yet, there is, room.

23. And the lord said unto the servantGo out among the highways and fences, and compel them to come in; that my house may be filled.

24. For, I say unto youNot one of those men who had been invited, shall taste of my supper.

25. And there were journeying together with him many multitudes; and, turning, he said unto them

26. If anyone cometh unto me, and hateth not his own father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, further also, even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.

27. Whoever beareth not his own cross, and cometh after me, cannot be my disciple.

28. For, who from among you, wishing to build a tower, doth not first sit down and count the cost,whether he hath sufficient for completion;

29. lest once, he having laid a foundation, and not being able to finish, all who are looking on, should begin to mock at him,

30. sayingThis man, began to build, and was not able to finish!

31. Or, what king, moving on to encounter, another king, in battle, will not sit down first and take counsel, whether he is able, with ten thousand, to meet him who, with twenty thousand, is coming against him.

32. And, if not, by any means, while he is yet afar off, he sendeth, an embassy, and requesteth the conditions of peace.

33. Thus, therefore, everyone from amongst you, who doth not bid adieu unto all his own possessions, cannot be my disciple.

34. Good, therefore is the salt; but, if, even the salt, become tasteless, wherewith shall it be seasoned?

35. Neither for land nor for manure, is it, fit: outside, they cast it! He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

## Luke 15

1. But all the tax-collectors and the sinners were, unto him, drawing near, to be hearkening unto him;

2. and both the Pharisees and the Scribes were murmuring, saying, This man, unto sinners, giveth welcome, and eateth with them.

3. And he spake unto them this parable, saying

4. What man from among you, having a hundred sheep, and losing, from among them, one, doth not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go his way after the lost one, until he find it?

5. And, finding it, he layeth it upon his shoulders, rejoicing;

6. and, coming unto his house, calleth together the friends and the neighbours, saying unto themRejoice with me! because I have found my sheep that was lost!

7. I say unto youThus, joy in heaven, will there be, over one sinner repenting, rather than over ninety-nine righteous persons, who indeed have, no need, of repentance.

8. Or, what woman, having, ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek carefully, until she find it?

9. And, having found it, she calleth together her female friends and neighbours, sayingRejoice with me! because I have found the piece of silver which I had lost.

10. Thus, I say unto you, there ariseth joy in presence of the messengers of God, over one sinner repenting.

11. And he saidA certain man, had two sons.

12. And the younger of them said unto the fatherFather! give me the share that falleth to me, of what there is. And, he, divided unto them the living.

13. And, after not many days, the younger son, gathering all together, left home for a country far away, and, there, squandered his substance with riotous living.

14. And, when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine throughout that country,and, he, began to be in want.

15. And he went his way, and joined himself unto one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to be feeding swine.

16. And he used to long to be filled with the pods which the swine were eating; and, no man, was giving unto him.

17. But coming, to himself, he saidHow many hired servants of my father, have bread enough and to spare, whereas, I, with famine, here, am perishing!

18. I will arise, and go unto my father, and will say unto himFather! I have sinned against heaven, and before thee:

19. No longer, am I worthy to be called a son of thine,Make me as one of thy hired servants. And he arose, and came unto his own father.

20. Now, while yet he was holding afar off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and, running, fell upon his neck, and tenderly kissed him.

21. And the son said unto himFather! I have sinned against heaven, and before thee: No longer, am I worthy to be called a son of thine, make me as one of thy hired servants.

22. But the father said unto his servantsQuick! bring forth a robethe best! and put on him, and get out a ring for his hand, and sandals for his feet.

23. And be bringing the fatted calf, sacrifice! and let us eat and make merry:

24. Because, this my son, was, dead, and hath come to life again, was lost, and is found. And they began to be making merry.

25. But his elder son was in a field; and, as, in coming, he drew near unto the house, he heard music and dancing,

26. and, calling near one of the youths, he inquired what these things, could be.

27. And, he, said unto him,Thy brother, hath come, and thy father hath sacrificed the fatted calf, because, safe and sound, hath he received him back.

28. But he was provoked to anger, and would not go in. And, his father, coming out, began to entreat him.

29. But, he, answering said unto his fatherLo! so many years as these, do I serve thee, and, at no time, a commandment of thine, have I transgressed,And, unto me, at no time, hast thou given a kid, that, with my friends, I might make merry;

30. But, when, this thy son, who had devoured thy living with harlots, came, thou didst sacrifice, for him, the fatted calf;

31. But, he, said unto himChild! thou, always, art, with me, and, all that is mine, is, thine;

32. But, to make merry and rejoice, there was need, because, this thy brotherwas, dead, and hath come to life again, and was lost, and is found.

## Luke 16

1. And he went on to say, unto his disciples also,There was, a certain rich man, who had a steward, and, the same, was accused to him as squandering his goods.

2. And, accosting him, he said unto himWhat is this I hear of thee? Render the account of thy stewardship, for thou canst no longer be steward.

3. And the steward said within himselfWhat shall I do, because my lord taketh away the stewardship from me? Dig, I cannot: to beg, I am ashamed.

4. I know what I will do, that, when I am removed out of the stewardship, they may welcome me into their own houses.

5. And, calling unto him each one of the debtors of his own lord, he was saying unto the first,How much owest thou my lord?

6. And, he, saidA hundred baths of oil. And, he, said unto himKindly take thine accounts, and, sitting down, make haste and writeFifty!

7. After that, unto another, he saidAnd how much owest, thou? And, he, saidA hundred homers of wheat. He saith unto himKindly take thine accounts, and writeEighty!

8. And the lord praised the unrighteous steward, in that with forethought he acted:Because, the sons of this age, have more forethought than the sons of light, respecting their own generation.

9. And, I, unto you, sayFor yourselves, make ye friends, with the unjust Riches, in order that, as soon as it shall fail, they may welcome you into the age-abiding tents.

10. The faithful in least, in much also, is, faithful, and, he that in least is unrighteous, in much also, is, unrighteous.

11. If therefore, in the unjust Riches ye proved unfaithful, the true, who, unto you, will entrust?

12. And, if, in what was anothers, ye proved unfaithful, your own, who will give unto you?

13. No domestic, can, unto two masters, be in service; for either, the one, he will hate, and, the other, love, or, unto the one, he will hold, and, the other, despise: Ye cannot, unto God, be in service, and unto Riches.

14. Now the Pharisees, who were, lovers of money, were hearing all these things, and were openly sneering at him.

15. And he said unto themYe, are they who justify themselves before men, but, God, knoweth your hearts; because, that which amongst men is lofty, is an abomination before God.

16. The law and the prophets, were until John,from that time, the good news of the kingdom of God, is being proclaimed, and, everyone, thereinto, is forcing his way.

17. But it is, easier, for heaven and earth to pass away, than that, of the law, one little point, should fail.

18. Every one divorcing his wife and marrying another, committeth adultery; and, he that marrieth a woman divorced from a husband, committeth adultery.

19. Now, a certain man, was rich, and he used to clothe himself with purple and fine linen, making merry day by day, brilliantly.

20. And, a certain beggar, by name Lazarus, used to be cast near his gate, full of sores,

21. and to long to be fed from the crumbs that fell from the table of the rich man: nay! even, the dogs, used to come and lick his sores.

22. And it came to pass that the beggar died, and was carried away by the messengers, into the bosom of Abraham. And, the rich man also, died, and was buried.

23. And, in hades, lifting up his eyes, being in torments, he seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.

24. And, he, calling out, saidFather Abraham! have mercy upon me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue,because I am in anguish in this flame.

25. But Abraham saidChild! rememberThat thou didst duly received thy good things in thy life, and, Lazarus, in like manner, the evil things; but, now, here, he is comforted, and, thou, art in anguish.

26. And, besides all these things, betwixt us and you, a great chasm, hath been fixed,so that, they who might wish to cross over from hence unto you, should not be able, nor any, from thence unto us, be crossing over.

27. But he saidI request thee then, father, that thou wouldst send him unto my fathers house,

28. for I have five brethren;that he may solemnly testify unto them, lest, they also, come into this place of torment.

29. But Abraham saithThey have Moses and the Prophets: Let them hearken unto them.

30. But, he, saidNay! father Abraham, but, if one, from the dead, should go unto them, they would repent.

31. But he said unto himIf, unto Moses and the Prophets, they do not hearken, neither, if one, from among the dead, should arise, would they be persuaded.

## Luke 17

1. And he said unto his disciples:It is, impossible, that occasions of stumbling should not come, notwithstanding, alas! for him through whom they do come:

2. It profiteth him, if, a mill-stone, is hung about his neck, and he is cast into the sea, than that he cause, one, of these little ones, to stumble.

3. Be taking heed to yourselves,If thy brother sin, rebuke him, and, if he repent, forgive him;

4. Even if, seven times a day, he sin against thee, and, seven times, turn to thee, saying, I repent, thou shalt forgive him.

5. And the apostles said unto the LordBestow on us faith!

6. And the Lord saidIf ye have faith like a grain of mustard-seed, ye should be saying unto  this  mulberry-treeBe uprooted! and be planted in the sea,and it should obey you.

7. But, who from among you, having, a servant, plowing or keeping sheep, when he hath come in out of the field, will say to himStraightway, come, and recline;

8. on the contrary, will not say to himMake somewhat ready, that I may dine,and, girding thyself, be ministering unto me, until I have eaten and drunk; and, after these things, thou, shalt eat and drink?

9. Doth he offer thanks unto the servant, because he hath done the things enjoined?

10. Thus, ye also, when ye have done all the things enjoined upon you, sayUnprofitable servants, are we,What we were bound to do, we have done!

11. And it came to pass, during the journey unto Jerusalem, that, he, was going through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

12. And, as he was entering into a certain village, there met him ten leprous men, who stood still, afar off;

13. and, they, lifted up a voice, sayingJesus! Master! have mercy on us!

14. And, beholding, he said unto themGo your way, and show yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, as they withdrew, they were cleansed.

15. But, one from among them, beholding that he was healed, returned, with a loud voice, glorifying God,

16. and fell prostrate at his feet, giving him thanks; and, he, was a Samaritan.

17. And Jesus, answering, saidWere not, the ten, cleansed?  but,  where, are, the nine?

18. Have none been found returning to give glory to God, save this one of another race?

19. And he said unto himArise and go thy way: thy faith, hath saved thee.

20. And, being questioned by the Pharisees, When cometh the kingdom of God? he answered them and saidThe kingdom of God cometh not with narrow watching;

21. Neither shall they sayLo, here! or, There. For lo! the kingdom of God, is, among you.

22. But he said unto the disciplesThere will come dayswhen ye will long to see, one of the days of the Son of Man, and shall not see.

23. And they will say unto you, Lo there! or, Lo here! Do not  depart, and do not  pursue.

24. For, just as, the lightning, flashing out of the one part under heaven, unto the other part under heaven, shineth, so, shall be, the Son of Man.

25. But, first, he must needs suffer, many things, and be rejected by this generation.

26. And, as it came to pass in the days of Noah, so, will it be, even in the days of the Son of Man:

27. They were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage,until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.

28. In like manner, as it came to pass in the days of Lot, They were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building,

29. But, on the day Lot came out from Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all:

30. According to the same things, will it be on the day the Son of Man is revealed.

31. In that day, he that shall be on the housetop, and his utensils in the house, let him not go down, to take them away! And, he that is in the field, in like manner, let him not turn unto the things behind,

32. Bear in mind the wife of Lot! Whosoever shall seek to make his life his own, shall lose it,

33. But, whosoever shall lose it, shall give it a living birth.

34. I say unto youOn the selfsame night, there shall be two men on  one  bed,the one, shall be taken near, and, the other, left behind;

35. There shall be two women grinding together,the one, shall be taken near, and, the other, left behind.

37. And, answering, they say unto himWhere, Lord? And, he, said unto themWhere the body is, there, the vultures also, will be gathered together.

## Luke 18

1. And he was speaking a parable unto them, as to its being needful for them always to pray, and not be faint-hearted;

2. sayingA certain judge, there was in a certain city,having, for God, no reverence, and, for man, no respect.

3. And, a widow, there was, in that city; and she kept coming unto him, sayingVindicate me from mine adversary!

4. And he was unwilling for a time; but, after these things, he said within himselfAlthough, neither God, I reverence, nor man, I respect,

5. Yet, if only because this widow annoyeth me, I will vindicate her,lest, persistently coming, she wholly wear me out.

6. And the Lord saidHear ye what, the unrighteous judge saith;

7. And shall, God, in any wise not execute the vindication of his chosen ones, who are crying out to him day and night, although he beareth long with regard to them?

8. I tell youHe will execute their vindication, quickly! nevertheless, though, the Son of Man, do come, will he, after all, find the faith on the earth?

9. And he spake, even unto certain who were confident in themselves that they were righteous, and were despising the rest, this parable:

10. Two men, went up into the temple to pray, one, a Pharisee, and, the other, a tax-collector.

11. The Pharisee, taking his stand, these things unto himself was praying: O God! I thank thee, that I am not like the rest of men,extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or, even as this tax-collector;

12. I fast twice in the week, I give a tenth of whatsoever things I gain!

13. But, the tax-collector, afar off, standing,would not so much as lift up, his eyes, unto heaven, but kept smiting his own breast sayingO God! be propitiated unto me, the sinner!

14. I tell youThis one went down justified, unto his house, rather than that one; because, every one who exalteth himself, shall be abased, but, he that abaseth himself, shall be exalted?

15. And they were bringing unto him, even the babes, that he might touch, them; but the disciples, seeing it, began to rebuke them.

16. But, Jesus, called them near, sayingSuffer, the children, to be coming unto me, and do not hinder them; for, of such, is the kingdom of God.

17. Verily I say unto youWhosoever shall not welcome the kingdom of God, as a child, in nowise shall enter thereinto.

18. And a certain, ruler, questioned him, sayingGood Teacher! by doing what, shall I inherit life age-abiding?

19. But Jesus said to himWhy, callest thou me, good? None, is good, save oneGod.

20. The commandments, thou knowest:Do not commit adultery, Do not commit murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness,Honour thy father and mother,

21. And, he, saidAll these things, have I kept from my youth.

22. And Jesus, hearing, said unto himYet one thing, unto thee, is lacking: Whatsoever thou hast, sell, and distribute unto the destitute,and thou shalt have treasure in  the  heavens; and come! be following me.

23. But, he, hearing these things, became, encompassed with grief; for he was rich exceedingly.

24. And Jesus, beholding him, saidWith what difficulty, shall, they who have money, enter, into the kingdom of God.

25. For it is, easier, for a camel, to enter, through the eye of a needle, than for, a rich man, to enter, into the kingdom of God.

26. And they who heard saidWho, then, can be saved?

27. And, he, saidThe things impossible with men, are, possible with God.

28. And Peter saidLo! we, have left our own possessions, and followed thee!

29. And, he, said unto themVerily, I say unto youNo one, is there, who hath lefthouse, or wife, or brethren, or parents, or children,for the sake of the kingdom of God;

30. who shall in anywise not receive manifold in this season, and, in the age that is coming, life age-abiding.

31. And, taking aside the twelve, he said unto themLo! we are going up unto Jerusalem, and all the things will be finished, which have been written through means of the prophets, respecting the Son of Man;

32. For he will be delivered up unto the nations, and be mocked, and insulted, and spit upon,

33. and, having scourged him, they will slay him, and, on the third day, will, he, arise.

34. And, they, not one of these things, understood, and this saying was hidden from them, and the could not comprehend the things spoken.

35. And it came to pass, as he was drawing near unto Jericho, a certain blind man, was sitting beside the road, begging.

36. And. hearkening unto a multitude moving along, he enquired, what this, might be.

37. And they told himJesus of Nazareth, is passing by!

38. And he cried aloud, sayingJesus, son of David! have mercy upon me!

39. And, they that were going before, began to rebuke him, that he might hold his peace. But, he, by so much the more, was crying outO Son of David! have mercy upon me!

40. And, standing still, Jesus commanded him to be led unto him; and, when he had drawn near, he questioned him

41. What desirest thou, I should do unto thee? And, he, saidLord! that I may recover sight!

42. And, Jesus, said unto himRecover sight! Thy faith, hath saved thee.

43. And, instantly, he recovered sight, and began to follow him, glorifying God. And, all the people, beholding, gave praise unto God.

## Luke 19

1. And, having entered, he was passing through Jericho;

2. and lo! a man, by name called Zacchaeus, and, he, was a chief tax-collector, and  he  was rich.

3. And he was seeking to see Jesus, what sort of man he was, and could not for the multitude, because, in stature, he was, small.

4. And, running forward unto the front, he got up a sycamore-tree, that he might see him; for, by that way, was he about to pass.

5. And, as he came up to the place, looking up, Jesus said unto himZacchaeus! make haste, and come down; For, to-day, in thy house, I must needs abide.

6. And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.

7. And all, when they beheld, began to murmur, sayingWith a sinful man, hath he gone in to lodge!

8. But, taking his stand, Zacchaeus said unto the LordLo! the half of my possessions, Lord, unto the destitute, I give; and, if, from anyone, I have taken aught by false accusation, I give back fourfold.

9. And Jesus said unto himThis day, salvation, unto this house, hath come,for that, he too, is, a son of Abraham;

10. For the Son of Man came, to seek and to save what was lost.

11. And, because they were hearing these things, he added and spake a parable, because of his being near Jerusalem, and their supposing that, instantly, was the kingdom of God to shine forth.

12. He said, thereforeA certain man, of noble birth, went into a country far away, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.

13. And, calling ten servants of his own, he gave unto them ten minas, and said unto themDo business, till I come.

14. But, his citizens, hated him, and sent off an embassy after him, sayingWe desire not, this, man, to be made king over us!

15. And it came to pass, when he returned, having received the kingdom, that he bade be called unto him these servants, to whom he had given the silver, that he might take note, what business they had done.

16. And the first came near, sayingLord! thy mina, hath made, ten minas.

17. And he said to himWell done! good servant. Because, in a very small thing, thou hast been, faithful, have thou authority over, ten cities.

18. And the second came, sayingThy mina, lord, hath made five minas.

19. And he said, to him also, And, thou, be over five cities.

20. And, the other, came, sayingLord, lo! thy mina, which I kept lying by in a napkin;

21. For I was afraid of thee, because, a harsh man, thou art,Thou takest up, what thou layedst not down, and reapest, what thou sowedst not!

22. He saith to himOut of thy mouth, do I judge thee, O wicked servant! Thou knewest that, I, a harsh man, am,taking up, what I laid not down, and reaping, what I did not sow;

23. Wherefore, then, didst thou not place my silver upon a  money-changers  table, and, I, when I came, with interest might have exacted it?

24. And, unto the by-standers, he saidTake, from him, the mina, and give unto him that hath, the ten minas;

25. And they said to him, Lord! he hath ten minas;

26. I tell youUnto everyone that hath, shall be given, whereas, from him that hath not, even what he hath, shall be taken away.

27. But, these mine enemies who desired not that I should be made king over them, bring ye here, and slay them outright before me.

28. And, having said these things, he was moving on in front, going up into Jerusalem.

29. And it came to pass, as he drew near unto Bethphage, and Bethany, unto the mount which is called the Mount of Olives, he sent off two of his disciples,

30. sayingGo your way unto the opposite village, in which, as ye are entering, ye shall find a colt, bound, whereon, no man, hath, ever sat,and, having loosed him, bring him.

31. And, if any one question youWherefore are ye loosing him? thus, shall ye sayHis Lord, hath, need.

32. And they who were sent, departing, found as he had said to them.

33. And, as they were loosing the colt, his lords said unto themWhy are ye loosing the colt?

34. And, they, saidHis Lord, hath, need.

35. And they brought him unto Jesus; and, throwing their mantles over the colt, they seated Jesus thereon.

36. And, as he moved along, they were spreading their own mantles in the way.

37. And, when he was drawing near, already, unto the descent of the Mount of Olives, one-and-all the throng of the disciples began joyfully to be praising God with a loud voice, concerning all the mighty works which they had seen;

38. sayingBlessed is he that cometh The king! In the name of the Lord! In heaven, peace! And glory in the highest!

39. And, certain of the Pharisees from the multitude, said unto himTeacher! rebuke thy disciples.

40. And he answered and saidI tell youIf, these, shall hold their peace, the stones, will cry out.

41. And, when he drew near, beholding the city, he wept over it, saying

42. If thou hadst got to know, in this day, even thou, the conditions of peace But, now, are they hid from thine eyes:

43. Because days will have come upon thee, that thine enemies will throw around a rampart against thee, and enclose thee; and hem thee in from every side,

44. And will level thee with the ground, and thy children within thee, and will not leave, stone on stone, within thee: because thou didst not get to know the season of thy visitation.

45. And, entering into the temple, he began to be casting out them who were selling;

46. saying unto themIt is written, And, my house, shall be, a house of prayer; but, ye, have made, it, a den of robbers.

47. And he was teaching day by day in the temple; but, the High-priests and the Scribes, also the chiefs of the people, were seeking to destroy him,

48. and could not find what they might do, for, the people, one and all, were hanging upon him, as they hearkened.

## Luke 20

1. And it came to pass, on one of the days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and telling the good tidings, that the High-priests and the Scribes, with the Elders, came upon him,

2. and spake, saying, unto himTell us, by what authority, these things, thou art doing, and, who, is it, that gave thee this authority.

3. And answering, he said unto themI too, will question, you, as to a matter,and tell me!

4. The immersion of John, Of heaven, was it, or of men?

5. And they deliberated together by themselves, sayingIf we say, Of heaven, he will say, Wherefore did ye not believe him?

6. But, if we say, Of men, the people, one and all, will stone us, for, persuaded, they are, that, John, was, a prophet.

7. And they answered, that they knew not whence.

8. And, Jesus, said unto themNeither do, I, tell, you, by what authority, these things, I am doing.

9. And he began, unto the people, to be speaking this parable:A man, planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen, and went from home for a long time.

10. And, in due season, he sent unto the husbandmen, a servant, that, of the fruit of the vineyard, they might give him; but, the husbandmen, having beaten him, sent him away empty.

11. And he, further, sent another servant; but, they, beating, that one also, and dishonouring him, sent him away, empty.

12. And he, further, sent, a third; but, they, bruising, this one also, thrust him out.

13. And the lord of the vineyard saidWhat shall I do? I will send my son, the beloved,It may be, that, him, they will respect.

14. But he husbandmen, seeing him, began to deliberate one with another, sayingThis, is, the heir: Let us slay him, that, ours, may be, the inheritance.

15. And, thrusting him forth outside the vineyard, they slew him. What, then, will the lord of the vineyard do unto them?

16. He will come, and destroy these husbandmen, and give the vineyard unto others. But, when they heard it, they saidFar be it!

17. But, he, looking at them, saidWhat, then, is this that is written,A stone which the builders rejected, The same, hath become, head of the corner?

18. Every one who falleth on that stone, will be sorely bruised, but, on whomsoever it shall fall, it will utterly destroy him.

19. And the Scribes and the High-priests sought to thrust on him their hands, in that very hour; and feared the people; for they perceived that, against them, spake he this parable.

20. And, watching narrowly, they sent forth suborned men, feigning themselves to be, righteous, that they might lay hold of a word of his, so as to deliver him up unto the rule and the authority of the governor.

21. And they questioned him, sayingTeacher! we know that, rightly, thou speakest and teachest, and respectest no person, but, in truth, the way of God, dost teach:

22. Is it allowable for us to give, unto Caesar, tribute, or not?

23. But, observing their villainy, he said unto them

24. Shew me a denary. Of whom, hath it an image and inscription? And, they, saidOf Caesar.

25. And, he, said unto themWell then! render the things of Caesar, unto Caesar, and the things of God, unto God.

26. And they could not lay hold of the saying, before the people; and, marvelling at his answer, they held their peace.

27. But there came near certain of the Sadducees, they who say, Resurrection, there is none! and questioned him,

28. sayingTeacher! Moses, wrote for us, If ones brother die, having a wife, and, he, be, childless, that his brother shall take the wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

29. Seven brethren, therefore, there were,and, the first, taking a wife, died childless,

30. And, the second,

31. and the third, took her,yea, likewise, even the seven; They left no children, and died:

32. Later on, the woman also, died.

33. The woman, therefore, in the resurrection, Of which of them, doth she become wife? for, the seven, had her to wife.

34. And Jesus said unto themThe sons of this age, marry, and are given in marriage,

35. But, they who have been accounted worthy, that age, to obtain, and the resurrection that is from among the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage;

36. For they cannot, even die any more,for, equal unto messengers, are they, and are, sons of God, Of the resurrection, being, sons.

37. But, that the dead do rise, even Moses, disclosed at the bush, when he calleth the LordThe God of Abraham and God of Isaac and God of Jacob:

38. Now, God, he is not, of the dead, but, of the living,for, all, unto him, do live.

39. And certain of the Scribes, answering, saidTeacher! Well, hast thou spoken.

40. For, no longer, were they daring to ask him any questions.

41. And he said unto themHow say they, that, the Christ, is, Davids Son?

42. For, David himself, saith, in   book of Psalms: Said the Lord, unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand,

43. Until I make thy foes thy footstool.

44. David, therefore, calleth, him Lord: How, then, his son, is he?

45. And, all the people hearing, he said unto the disciples:

46. Be taking heed of the ScribesWho desire to walk about in long robes, and are fond of salutations in the markets, and first seats in the synagogues, and first couches in the chief meals,

47. Who devour the houses of widows, and, for a show, are a long time at prayer. These, shall receive, a heavier sentence.

## Luke 21

1. And, looking up, he saw the, rich, who were casting their gifts into the treasury,

2. and he saw a certain poor widow, casting in thither two mites;

3. and he saidOf a truth, I say unto youThis destitute widow, more than they all, hath cast in;

4. For, all these, out of their superfluity, have cast in among the gifts, but, she, out of her deficiency, all the living that she had, hath cast in.

5. And, certain saying, of the templeWith beautiful stones and offerings, hath it been adorned! he said

6. As to these things, which ye are looking upon, There will come days, in which there will not be left here, stone upon stone, which will not be taken down.

7. And they questioned him, sayingTeacher! when, therefore, will these things be? And, what the sign, when these things shall be about to come to pass?

8. And, he, saidBe taking heed ye be not deceived; for, many, will come upon my name, sayingI, am he,andThe season, hath drawn near! Do not go after them.

9. But, whensoever ye shall hear of wars and revolutions, be not terrified,for these things, must needs, come to pass first, but, not immediately, is the end.

10. Then, said he unto themThere will rise up, nation against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;

11. As well great earthquakes, as also, in places, pestilences and famines, will there be, as well objects of terror, as also, from heaven, great signs, will there be.

12. And before, all these things, they will thrust upon you their hands, and persecute you, delivering you up into the synagogues and prisons,when ye have been led away before kings and governors, for the sake of my name;

13. But it shall turn out to you for a witness.

14. Settle, then, in your hearts, not to be studying beforehand, how to make defense;

15. For, I, will give you a mouth and wisdom, which one-and-all who are setting themselves against, you shall be unable to withstand or gainsay.

16. But ye will be delivered up, even by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolk, and friends, and they will put to death some from among you;

17. And ye will be hated by all, because of my name:

18. And, a hair of your head, in nowise shall perish,

19. By your endurance, shall ye gain your lives for a possession.

20. But whensoever ye shall see Jerusalem, encompassed by armies, then, know, that her desolation hath drawn near.

21. Then they who are in Judaea, let them flee into the mountains, and they who are in her midst, let them go forth,and they who are in the fields, let them not enter into her;

22. For, days of avenging, are, these, for all the things written to be fulfilled.

23. Alas! for the women with child, and for them who are giving suck, in those days; for there will be great distress upon the land, and anger against this people.

24. And they will fall by the edge of the sword, and be carried away captive into all the nations, and, Jerusalem, shall be trodden down by the nations, until the seasons of the nations shall be fulfilled  and shall be .

25. And there will he signs in sun, and moon, and stars, and, on the earth, anguish of nations in embarrassmentsea and surge resounding,

26. Men fainting, from fear and expectation of the things overtaking the inhabited earth. For, the powers of the heavens, will be shaken.

27. And, then, will they see the Son of Mancoming in a cloud, with great power and glory.

28. And, when these things are beginning to come to pass, unbend and lift up your heads, because that, your redemption, is drawing near.

29. And he spake a parable unto them: See the fig-tree, and all the trees,

30. Whensoever they have already budded, seeing it, of yourselves, ye observe that, already near, is, the summer:

31. Thus, ye also, whensoever ye shall see, these, things coming to pass, observe ye, that, near, is the kingdom of God!

32. Verily, I say unto youIn nowise shall this generation pass away, until, all things, shall happen:

33. Heaven and earth, will pass away, but, my word, in nowise will pass away.

34. But be taking heed unto yourselves, lest once your hearts be made heavywith debauch and drunkenness and anxieties about livelihood, and that day come upon you suddenly,

35. as a snare,For it will come in by surprise, upon all them that are dwelling on the face of all the earth.

36. But be watching in every season, making supplication, that ye may gain full vigour, to escape all these things that are about to be coming to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.

37. And he was, by day, in the temple, teaching; but, by night, going forth, he was lodging in the mount which is called the Mount of Olives.

38. And, all the people, were coming at day-break unto him, in the temple, to be hearkening unto him.

## Luke 22

1. And the feast of the unleavened bread, which is called a Passover, was drawing near.

2. And the High-priests and the Scribes were seeking, how they might get rid of him; for they feared the people.

3. But Satan entered into Judas, him called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve;

4. and, departing, he conversed with the High-priests and Captains, as to how, unto them, he might deliver him up.

5. And they rejoiced, and bargained with him to give him, silver;

6. and he freely consented, and began seeking a good opportunity for delivering him up, in the absence of a multitude, unto them.

7. Now the day of the unleavened bread a came,on which it was needful to be sacrificing the passover.

8. And he sent forth Peter and John, sayingGo, and make ready, for us, the passover, that we may eat.

9. And, they, said unto himWhere wiliest thou, we should make ready?

10. And, he, said unto themLo! when ye have entered into the city, there will meet you a man, bearing, an earthen-jar of water: follow him into the house into which he is entering.

11. And ye shall say unto the master of the houseThe teacher saith unto thee, where is the lodging, where, the passover, with my disciples, I may eat?

12. And, he, unto you, will shew, a large upper room, spread: there, make ready.

13. And, departing, they found according as he had said unto them, and made ready the passover.

14. And, when the hour arrived, he reclined, and the apostles with him.

15. And he said unto themI have greatly desired, to eat, this passover, with you before I suffer;

16. For, I say unto youIn nowise shall I eat it, until it have been fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

17. And, accepting a cup, giving thanks, he saidTake this, and divide among yourselves;

18. For, I say unto youIn nowise shall I drink henceforth of the fruit of the vine, until, the kingdom of God, shall come.

19. And, taking a loaf, he gave thanks, and brake, and gave unto them, sayingThis is my body

20. fehlt

21. Nevertheless, lo! the hand of him who is delivering me up, is with me upon the table.

22. Because, the Son of Man, indeed, according to what is marked out, goeth his way; nevertheless, alas! for that man through whom he is being delivered up.

23. And, they, began to be enquiring together, among themselves, as to which, then, it could be, from among them, who, this thing, was about to perpetrate!

24. And it came to pass that there was, a rivalry also, among them, as to which of them seemed to be greater   .

25. And, he, said unto themThe kings of the nations, lord it over them, and, they who wield authority over them, benefactors, are called.

26. But, ye, not so! On the contrarythe greater among you, Let him become as, the younger, and, he that governeth, as, he that ministereth,

27. For which is greaterhe that reclineth? or he that ministereth? Is not he that reclineth? But, I, am, in your midst, as he that ministereth,

28. Ye, however, are they who have remained throughout with me in my temptations;

29. And, I, covenant unto youas my Father hath covenanted unto mea kingdom,

30. That ye may eat and drink, at my table, in my kingdom, and sit upon thrones, judging, the twelve tribes of Israel.

31. Simon! Simon! lo! Satan, hath claimed you, to sift as wheat;

32. But, I, have entreated for thee, that thy faith may not fail. And, thou, once thou hast turned, strengthen thy brethren.

33. But, he, said unto himLord! with thee, am I, ready, both into prison and unto death, to be going.

34. And, he, said: I tell thee, PeterA cock will not crow this day, until, thrice, thou deny that thou knowest me.

35. And he said unto themWhen I sent you forth, without purse or satchel or sandals, of anything, came ye short? And, they, saidOf nothing!

36. And he said unto themBut, now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, in like manner also, a satchel; and, he that hath nothing, let him sell his mantle, and buy a sword!

37. For I say unto youThis that is written, must needs be completed in me,And, with lawless ones, was he reckoned; for, even that which concerneth me, hath, completion.

38. And, they, saidLord, lo! two swords, here! And, he, said unto themTis, enough!

39. And going out, he went, according to his custom, unto the Mount of Olives; and the disciples  also  followed him.

40. And, coming up to the place, he said unto themBe praying, lest ye enter into temptation.

41. And, he, was torn from them about a stones throw; and, bending his knees, he began to pray,

42. sayingFather! if thou please, bear aside this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but thine, be accomplished.

44. fehlt

45. And, arising from prayer, he came unto his disciples, and found them falling asleep by reason of their grief;

46. and he said unto themWhy are ye slumbering? Arise! and be praying, lest ye enter into temptation.

47. While yet he was speaking, lo! a multitude; and, he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them on,and he drew near unto Jesus, to kiss him.

48. But, Jesus, said to himJudas! with a kiss, the Son of Man, dost thou deliver up?

49. And they who were about him, seeing what would be, saidLord! shall we smite with the sword?

50. And a certain one from among them smote, the High-priests, servant, and took off his right ear.

51. But Jesus, answering, saidLet beas long as this! And, touching the ear, he healed him.

52. And Jesus said unto the High-priests, and Captains of the temple, and Elders, who had come against himAs against a robber, have ye come out, with swords and clubs?

53. Daily, was I with you, in the temple, and yet ye stretched not forth your hands against me! But, this, is your hour, and the authority of darkness.

54. And, having arrested him, they led him away, and took him into the house of the High-priest; and, Peter, was following afar.

55. And, they having kindled up a fire in the midst of the court, and taken seats together, Peter was for sitting among them.

56. But, a certain maid-servant, seeing him seating himself towards the light, and looking steadfastly at him, saidThis one also, was, with him.

57. But, he, denied, sayingI know him not, woman!

58. And, after a little, another, beholding him, saidThou also, art, from among them. But, Peter, saidMan! I am not.

59. And, about one hour having passed, a certain other, began stoutly to insist, sayingOf a truth, this one also, was with him; for indeed he is, a Galilaean.

60. But Peter saidMan! I know not what thou art saying! And, instantly while yet he was speaking, a cock crew.

61. And the Lord turned, and looked at Peter; and Peter was put in mind of the declaration of the Lord, how he had said to himBefore, a cock, crow this day, thou wilt deny me thrice!

62.  And, going forth outside, he wept bitterly.

63. And, the men who held him bound, kept mocking him, with blows;

64. and, blindfolding him, questioned him, sayingProphesy! which is he that smote thee?

65. and, many other things, with profane speech, were they saying unto him.

66. And, when it became day, the Eldership of the people was gathered togetherboth High-priests and Scribes,and they led him away into their high-council, sayingIf, thou, art the Christ, tell us!

67. But he said unto themIf I should tell, you, in nowise would ye believe,

68. And, if I should put questions, in nowise would ye answer;

69. But, henceforth, shall the Son of Man be seated on the right hand of the power of God.

70. And they all saidThou, then, art the Son of God? And, he, unto them saidYe, say   ,because, I, am.

71. And, they, saidWhat, further, need have we, of witness? We ourselves, have heard it from his mouth.

## Luke 23

1. And one and all the throng of them, arising, led him unto Pilate.

2. And they began to accuse him, sayingThis one, found we, perverting our nation, and forbidding to give, tribute unto Caesar,and affirming himself to be, an anointed king.

3. And, Pilate, questioned him, sayingArt, thou, the king of the Jews? And, he, answering him, saidThou, sayest.

4. And, Pilate, said unto the High-priests and the multitudes, Nothing, find I, worthy of blame, in this man.

5. But, they, began to be urgent, sayingHe is stirring up the people, teaching along all Judaea, even beginning from Galilee unto this place.

6. Now, Pilate, hearing   , questioned whether the man was, a Galilaean.

7. And, getting to know that he was of the jurisdiction of Herod, he sent him back unto Herod, he also, being in Jerusalem in these days.

8. And, Herod, seeing Jesus, rejoiced exceedingly; for he had been, a considerable number of times, wishing to see him,because he had heard concerning him, and was hoping, some sign, to behold, by him, brought to pass.

9. And he went on to question him in a good many words; but, he, answered him, nothing.

10. And the High-priests and the Scribes stood vehemently accusing him.

11. And Herod with his soldiery, having set him at nought, and mocked him, threw about him a gorgeous robe, and sent him back unto Pilate.

12. And they became friendsboth Herod and Pilateon the self-same day, one with another; for they had previously been at enmity between themselves.

13. And, Pilate, calling together the High-priests, and the Rulers, and the people,

14. said unto themYe brought unto me this man, as one turning away the people, and lo! I, in your presence, examining him, found, nothing, in this man worthy of blame, in respect of the things whereof ye were making accusation against him.

15. Nay! nor Herod; for he hath sent him back unto you,and lo! nothing worthy of death, hath been done by him.

16. So, then, chastising him, I will release him.

18. But they cried aloud, with the whole throng, sayingAway with this man! and release unto us Barabbas:

19. who indeed, because of a certain revolt which had occurred in the city, and of murder, had been thrown into prison.

20. Again, however, Pilate, called out unto them, wishing to release Jesus.

21. But, they, called out in return, sayingCrucify! crucify him!

22. But, he, the third time, said unto themWhy! what base thing hath this man done? Nothing worthy of death, found I in him. Chastising him, then, I will release him!

23. But they became urgent with loud voices, claiming to have him crucified; and their voices began to prevail.

24. And, Pilate, consented, that their request should be granted;

25. and released him who, for revolt and murder, had been cast into prison, whom they claimed,whereas, Jesus, delivered he up unto their will.

26. And, as they led him away, they laid hold of a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the country,they laid on him the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.

27. And there was following him a great throng of the people, and of women, who were smiting themselves and lamenting him.

28. But, turning towards them, Jesus saidDaughters of Jerusalem! Do not weep for me; but, for yourselves, be weeping, and for your children.

29. For lo! days are coming, in which they will sayHappy the barren! even the wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never gave suck.

30. Then, will they begin to sayunto the mountains, Fall upon us! and unto the hills, Cover us!

31. Because if, in moist wood, these things, they are doing,in, the dry, what shall happen?

32. And there were being led, two other evil-doers also, to be lifted up.

33. And, when they came into the place which was called Skull, there, they crucified him; and the evil-doers, one indeed on the right hand, and the other on the left.

34. And, when they were parting his garments, they cast lots.

35. And the people were standing, looking on. But the rulers were sneering, sayingOthers, he saved, let him save himself,if, this, is, the Christ of God, the Chosen.

36. Moreover the soldiers also mocked him,coming near, offering, vinegar, unto him,

37. and sayingIf, thou, art the King of the Jews, save thyself.

38. Now there was an inscription also, over himTHE KING OF THE JEWS, THIS!

39. And, one of the suspended evil-doers, began to defame himArt not, thou, the Christ? Save thyself and us!

40. But the other, answering, rebuked him, and saidNeither fearest, thou, God, in that thou art, in the same judgment?

41. And, we, indeed, justly,for, things worthy of what we have done, are we duly receiving, but, this man, nothing amiss, hath done.

42. And he went on to sayJesus! remember me, whensoever thou shalt come into thy kingdom.

43. And he said unto himVerily, I say unto thee this day: With me, shalt thou be in Paradise.

44. And it was already about the sixth hour, and, darkness, came upon the whole land, until the ninth hour,

45. the sun failing; and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.

46. And, calling out with a loud voice, Jesus saidFather! into thy hands, I commend my spirit. And, this, saying, he ceased to breathe.

47. And the centurion, beholding that which came to pass, began to glorify God, sayingIn very deed, this man, was, righteous.

48. And, all the multitudes who had been drawn together unto this spectacle, having looked upon the things that came to pass, smiting their breasts, began to return.

49. But all they who were acquainted with him, were standing afar off, women also who had followed with him from Galilee,beholding these things.

50. And lo! a man, by name Joseph, being, a councillor,a good and righteous man

51. (the same had not consented unto their plan and deed),from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was awaiting the kingdom of God,

52. the same, going unto Pilate, claimed the body of Jesus.

53. And, taking it down, he wrapped it in a fine Indian cloth, and laid him in a tomb hewn in stone,where no one as yet was lying.

54. And it was a day of preparation, and, a Sabbath, was about to dawn.

55. And the women, they who had come out of Galilee with him, following after, observed the tomb, and how his body was laid.

56. And, returning, they made ready spices and perfumes. And, on the Sabbath, indeed, they were quiet, according to the commandment;

## Luke 24

1. but, on the first day of the week, at early dawn, unto the tomb, came they, bringing the spices which they had prepared.

2. And they found the stone, rolled away from the tomb;

3. but, when they entered, they found not the body  .

4. And it came to pass, while they were perplexing themselves concerning this, that 1o! two men, stood near them, in dazzling raiment.

5. And, they becoming afraid, and bending their faces unto the ground, they said unto themWhy seek ye the Living One with the dead?

6. Remember how he spake unto you while yet he was in Galilee:

7. Saying, as to the Son of Man, that he must needs be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified,and, on the third day, arise.

8. And they remembered his sayings;

9. and, returning  from the tomb , reported all these things unto the eleven, and unto all the rest.

10. Now they were the Magdalene Mary, and Joana, and Mary the mother of James; and, the other women with them, were telling, unto the apostles, these things.

11. And these sayings appeared before them, as if idle talk, and they were minded to disbelieve them.

12. fehlt

13. And lo! two from among them, on the selfsame day, were journeying unto a village, distant sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, the name of which, was Emmaus;

14. and, they, were conversing one with another, about all these things which had occurred.

15. And it came to pass, as they were conversing and reasoning together, that, Jesus himself, drawing near, was journeying with them;

16. but, their eyes, were held, so as not to know him.

17. And he said unto themWhat are these things which ye are debating one with another, as ye walk along? And they came to a stand, sad in countenance.

18. But one, by name Cleopas, answering, said unto himArt, thou, lodging, alone, in Jerusalem, and knowest not the things which have come to pass therein in these days?

19. And he said unto themWhat things? And, they, said unto himThe things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who became a prophet, mighty in work and word, before God and all the people:

20. In what way also our High-priests and Rulers delivered him up unto a sentence of death, and crucified him.

21. We, however, were hoping that, he, was the one destined to redeem Israel! But indeed, even with all these things, this brings on, the third, day, since these things happened:

22. Nay! certain women also, from amongst us, have made us beside ourselves, in that they went early unto the tomb;

23. and, not finding his body, came, sayingthat, a vision of messengers, they had seen, who were affirming him to be alive.

24. And certain of them who were with us departed unto the tomb,and found so, according as, the women, had said; but, him, they saw not.

25. And, he, said unto themO thoughtless ones! and slow in heart to rest your faith upon all things which the prophets have spoken:

26. Was it not needful for the Christ, these very things, to suffer, and to enter into his glory?

27. And, beginning from Moses, and from all the prophets, he thoroughly explained to them, in all the Scriptures, the things concerning himself.

28. And they drew near unto the village, whither they were journeying; and, he, made for journeying, further.

29. And they constrained him, sayingAbide with us; because it is, towards evening, and the day hath already declined. And he went in to abide with them.

30. And it came to pass, when he reclined with them, taking the loaf, he blessed, and, breaking it, went on to give unto them.
