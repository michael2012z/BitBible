## Nehemiah 1

__O Yahweh, God of Israel, righteous thou art, for we have had left us a deliverance as at this day,here we are, before thee, in our guilty deeds, for there is no standing before thee, because of this thing!__

1. The story of Nehemiah, son of Hacaliah,and it came to pass, in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, when, I, was in Shusan the fortress,

2. that Hanani one of my brethren came, he and certain men out of Judah,so I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.

3. And they said unto me, The remnant who are left of the captivity, there in the province, are in great misfortune and reproach, the wall of Jerusalem, is broken down, and, the gates thereof, are burned with fire.

4. And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and I mourned certain days,and continued fasting and praying, before the God of the heavens;

5. and said, I beseech thee, O Yahweh God of the heavens, the great and fearful GOD,keeping the covenant and lovingkindness for them who love him and keep his commandments:

6. Let, I pray thee, thine ears be attentive and thine eyes opento hearken unto the prayer of thy servant-which, I, am praying before thee now, day and night, for the sons of Israel, thy servants,-and making confession concerning the sins of the sons of Israel, which we have committed against thee, both I and the house of my father, have sinned.

7. We have dealt, very corruptly, against thee,and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes nor the regulations, which thou didst command Moses thy servant.

8. Remember, I pray thee, the word, which thou didst command Moses thy servant, saying,If, ye, are unfaithful, I, will scatter you among the peoples:

9. When ye return unto me and keep my commandments and do them, though it should be that ye have been driven out unto the uttermost part of the heavens, from thence, will I gather them, and bring them into the place that I have chosen to make a habitation for my Name there.

10. They, therefore, are thy servants, and thy people,whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy firm hand.

11. I beseech thee O My Lord, letI pray theethine ear be attentive unto the prayer of thy servant, and unto the prayer of thy servants who delight to revere thy Name, and oh prosper, I pray thee, thy servant to-day, and grant him compassion before this man. Now, I, was cup-bearer unto the king.

## Nehemiah 2

1. And it came to pass, in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that, wine, was before him,so I took up the wine, and gave unto the king, and I had never been sad before him.

2. Then said the king unto me, Wherefore is thy countenance sad, seeing that, thou, art not sick? this is nothing else, but sadness of heart. Then feared I exceedingly,

3. and said unto the kingLet the, king, unto times age-abiding, live! Wherefore should my countenance, not be sad, when, the citythe place of the sepulchres of my fathers, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?

4. Then the king said to me, Concerning what, is it, thou, wouldst make request? So I prayed unto the God of the heavens,

5. and then said unto the king, If, unto the king, it seemeth good, and if thy servant might find favour before thee, That thou wouldst send me unto Judah, unto the city of the sepulchres of my fathers, that I might build it.

6. And the king said unto me, the queen, also sitting beside him, For how long would be thy journey? and when wouldst thou return? So it seemed good before the king to send me, and I set him a time.

7. Then said I unto the king, If, unto the king, it seemeth good, may, letters, be given me, unto the pashas Beyond the River,that they may convey me over, until I come into Judah;

8. also a letter unto Asaph, keeper of the park that belongeth unto the king, that he may give me timber to build up the gates of the fortress which pertaineth to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house whereinto I shall enter. And the king gave me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.

9. Then came I unto the pashas Beyond the River, and gave them the letters of the king,now the king, had sent with me, captains of the army, and horsemen.

10. And, when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant the Ammonite, heard of it, it vexed them, with a great vexation,that there had come a man, to seek welfare, for the sons of Israel.

11. So I entered Jerusalem,and was there three days.

12. Then rose I by night, I, and a few men with me, I having told no man, what, my God, had been putting in my heart, to do for Jerusalem,and, beast, was there none with me, save the beast on which, I myself, was riding.

13. So I went forth through the valley-gate by night, even unto the front of the snake-fountain, and into the dung-gate,and I viewed the walls of Jerusalem, how, they, were broken down, and, the gates thereof, consumed with fire.

14. Then passed I over unto the fountain-gate, and unto the pool of the king,but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.

15. Then went I up in the torrent-bed, by night, and viewed the wall,and turned back, and entered by the valley-gate, and so returned.

16. Now, the deputies, knew not whither I had gone, nor what I was doing,not even to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the deputies, nor to the rest who were doing the work, had I as yet told it.

17. So I said unto them, Ye, can see the misfortune that, we, are in, how that, Jerusalem, lieth waste, and, the gates thereof, are burned with fire: Come, and let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may remain, no longer, a reproach.

18. Then told I them, of the hand of my God, that, it, had been good upon me, as also of the words of the king, which he had spoken unto me,so they said, We will arise and build! and they strengthened their hands right well.

19. But, when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed at us, and poured contempt upon us,and said, What is this thing which ye would do? against the king, would ye rebel?

20. Then answered I them, and said to themThe God of the heavenshe, will prosper us, therefore, we his servants, will arise and build,But, to you, pertaineth no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.

## Nehemiah 4

1. But it came to pass, when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, it angered him, and he was greatly displeased,and mocked the Jews;

2. and spake before his brethren, and the army of Samaria, and said, What are, these feeble Jews, doing? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they bring to life the stones out of the heaps of dust, when, they, have been burned up?

3. Now, Tobiah the Ammonite, was beside him,so he said, Even that which they are building, if a fox should go up, he would break down their stone wall!

4. Hear, O our God, for we have become a contempt, and turn thou back their reproach upon their own head,and give them up as a prey, in the land of captivity;

5. and do not cover their iniquity, and, their sin before thee, let it not be blotted out,for they have caused vexation before them who are building.

6. So we built the wall, and all the wall was finished unto the half thereof,-and the people had a mind to work.

7. But it came to pass, when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabians and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the repair of the walls of Jerusalem had gone up, that the breaches began to be stopped, that it angered them exceedingly;

8. and they conspired, all of them together, to come, to fight against Jerusalem,and to cause it harm;

9. howbeit we prayed unto our God,and set a watch against them, day and night, because of them.

10. Then said Judah, The strength of the burden-bearer faileth, and, the rubbish, aboundeth,and, we, are not able to build at the wall;

11. and our adversaries have said, They shall not know, neither shall they see, until we come into their midst, and slay them,so shall we cause the work to cease.

12. But it came to pass, when the Jews dwelling near them came in, then said they unto us, ten times, From all places whither ye shall turn,   upon us!

13. So I seton the lower slopes of the place behind the wall in the waste grounds,yea I set the people, by their families, with their swords, their spears and their bows.

14. Then I looked and rose up, and saidunto the nobles and unto the deputies and unto the rest of the people, Do not ye fear because of them,the great and fearful Lord, remember ye, so shall ye fight for your brethren, your sons and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.

15. And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that God had overturned their counsel, then returned we, all of us, unto the wall, every man unto his work.

16. And it came to pass, from that day, the half of my young men, were working in the work, and, the half of them, were grasping the spears, the bucklers, and the bows, and the coats of mail,but, the rulers, were behind all the house of Judah.

17. They who were building at the wall and they who were carrying burdens, they who were lifting,   , with his one hand, was working at the work, and, with the other, was grasping the weapon.

18. Even they who were building, every man, had his sword girded upon his loins, and so was building,and, he that sounded the horn, was by my side.

19. So I said unto the nobles and unto the deputies, and unto the rest of the people, The work, is great and large,and, we, are separated upon the wall, far away, each man from his brother:

20. In what place soever ye shall hear the sound of the horn, thither, gather yourselves unto us,our God, will fight for us.

21. So, we, were working at the work,one half of them, grasping the spears, from the uprisings of the dawn, until the coming out of the stars.

22. Moreover, at that time, I said to the people, Let, every one with his young man, lodge for the night in the midst of Jerusalem,so shall they serve us, in the night, as a watch, and, the day, for work.

23. So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my young men, nor the men of the watch that followed me, none of us, put off our clothes,every one

## Nehemiah 5

1. Then came there to be a great outcry of the people and their wives,against their brethren the Jews.

2. And there were some who were saying, Our sons and our daughters, are we pledging,that we may obtain corn, and eat, and keep ourselves alive.

3. And there were some who were saying, Our fields and our vineyards and our houses, are we pledging,-that we may obtain corn in the dearth.

4. And there were others who were saying, We have borrowed silver, for the kings tribute,  our lands and our vineyards.

5. Now, therefore, as is the flesh of our brethren, so is our flesh, as are their children, so are our children. Yet lo! we are putting in subjection our sons and our daughters, for bondservants, yea there are some of our daughters already trodden down, and we are powerless, and, our fields and our vineyards, belong to others.

6. And it angered me greatly,when I heard their outcry, and these words.

7. So my heart took counsel unto me and I contended with the nobles and with the deputies, and said to them, A loan on interestevery man to his brother, are ye making,So I appointed over them a great assembly;

8. and I said unto them, We, have bought our brethren the Jews, who had sold themselves unto the nations, according to our ability, and will, ye, even sell your brethren, or shall they sell themselves unto us? And they were silent, and found no answer.

9. Then said I, Not good, is the thing which ye are doing,ought ye not, in the fear of God, to walk, because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies?

10. I too, then, my brethren and my young men, might be lending unto them on interest silver and corn! I pray you, let us leave off this lending on interest!

11. Restore, I pray you, unto them this very day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses,also the hundredth of silver and corn, new wine and oil, for which ye have been lending to them.

12. And they said, We will restore them, and, from them, will we require nothing, so, will we do, as thou, art saying. Then called I the priests, and put them on oath, to do according to this promise.

13. Also, my lap, shook I out, and saidThus and thus, may God shake out every man who shall not confirm this promise, out of his house and out of his labour, yea, thus and thus, let him be shaken out and empty,And all the convocation said, Amen! and praised Yahweh, and the people did according to this promise.

14. Moreover, from the day I was commanded to become their pasha in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year, even unto the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, twelve years, I and my brethren, pashas bread, have not eaten;

15. whereas, the former pashas, who were before me, suffered themselves to be a burden upon the people, and took from them in bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver, even, their young men, bare rule over the people,but, I, did not so, because of the fear of God.

16. Moreover also, in this work of the wall, I repaired, and, no field, did we buy,though, all my young men, were gathered thither unto the work.

17. And, Jews and deputies, a hundred and fifty men, and they who were coming in unto us from among the nations which were round about us,   upon my table.

18. Now, that which was prepared for a single day, wasone ox, six choice sheep, also, fowls, were prepared for me, and, apportioned unto ten days, of every sort of wine, in abundance,yet, in spite of this, the bread of the pasha, demanded I not, because heavy was the bondage upon this people.

19. Remember unto me, O my God, for good,all that I have done for this people.

## Nehemiah 6

1. And it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah and to Geshem the Arabian and to the rest of our enemies, that I had built the wall, and there was left therein no breach,though, up to that time, the doors, had I not set up in the gates,

2. that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come! and let us meet together in the villages, in the valley of Ono,But, they, were plotting to do me harm.

3. So I sent unto them messengers, saying, A great work, am, I, doing, and cannot come down,wherefore should the work cease whilst I leave it, and come down unto you?

4. Yet they sent unto me, according to this message, four times,and I replied to them according to this answer.

5. Then Sanballat sent unto me, according to this message, a fifth time, by his young man,with an open letter, in his hand:

6. wherein was writtenAmong the nations, it is reported, and, Gashmu, saith it, that, thou and the Jews, are plotting to rebel, for which cause, thou art building the wall,and, thou, art to become their king, according to these words.

7. Moreover also, prophets, hast thou set up to make proclamation concerning thee in Jerusalem, saying, He hath become king in Judah! Now, therefore, will it he reported to the king, according to these words. Now, therefore, come, and let us take counsel together.

8. Then sent I unto him, saying, Nothing hath been done, according to these words, which thou art saying,but, out of thine own heart, art thou feigning them.

9. For, they all, were seeking to put us in fear, saying, Their hands will slacken from the work, and it will not be accomplished. Now, therefore, strengthen thou my hands!

10. When, I, came into the house of Shemaiah, son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, he, being shut in, he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, in the midst of the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to slay thee, yea, by night, are they coming to slay thee.

11. Then said I, Should, such a man as I, flee? Who then, being such as I, would enter the temple to save his life? I will not enter.

12. Then perceived I, that lo! it was, not God, who had sent him,though, a prophecy, he had spoken concerning me, but, Tobiah and Sanballat, had hired him:

13. to this end, hired, he was, to the end that I might be afraid and do so, and might sin,and it might serve them for an evil report, to the end they might bring reproach upon me.

14. Have remembrance, O my God, of Tobiah and of Sanballat, according to these their doings,moreover also, of Noadiah the prophetess, and of the rest of the prophets, who would have put me in fear.

15. So the wall was finished, on the twenty-fifth of Elul,in fifty-two days.

16. And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard, and all the nations that were round about us saw, that they fell greatly in their own eyes, and took knowledge that, from God, had this work been wrought.

17. Moreover, in those days, were the nobles of Judah busy with their letters which were going unto Tobiah,and those of Tobiah were coming unto them;

18. for, many in Judah, had taken an oath to him, because he was in marriage affinity with Shecaniah son of Arah,and, Jehohanan his son, had taken the daughter of Meshullam, son of Berechiah.

19. Moreover, his good deeds, were they telling before me, and, my affairs, were they carrying out to him,letters, did Tobiah send to put me in fear.

## Nehemiah 7

1. And it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors,and the doorkeepers and the singers and the Levites had been appointed,

2. that I gave Hanani my brother, and Hananiah captain of the castle, charge over Jerusalem, for, he, was a truly faithful man, and revered God above many.

3. And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until, hot, be the sun, and, while they are standing by, let them close the doors, and make them fast,setting watches, of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one over against his own house.

4. Now, the city, was broad on both hands, and large, but, the people, were few in the midst thereof,and the houses had not been built.

5. So then my God put it into my heart, and I gathered together the nobles and the deputies and the people, to register their genealogy,then found I a register roll, of them who came up at the first, and found written therein:

6. These, are the sons of the province, who came up from among the Captives of the Exile, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did exile,but they came back to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one to his own city;

71. and, some of the ancestral chiefs, gave unto the treasury of the work, of gold, twenty thousand darics,and, of silver, two thousand and two hundred manehs;

72. and, that which the rest of the people gave, was, of gold, twenty thousand darics, and, of silver, two thousand manehs,and, tunics for priests, sixty-seven.

73. So the priests and the Levites and the door-keepers and the singers and some of the people, and the Nethinim and all Israel, took up their abode in their cities. And, when the seventh month arrived, the sons of Israel were in their cities.

## Nehemiah 8

1. Then all the people gathered themselves together as one man, into the broad way that was before the water-gate,and they spake unto Ezra the scribe, to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Yahweh had commanded Israel.

2. So then Ezra the priest brought the law, before the convocation of both men and women, and all that had understanding to hearken,on the first day of the seventh month;

3. and read therein, before the broad place which was before the water-gate, from the time it was light, until the noon of the day, in presence of the men and the women, and such as had understanding,and, the ears of all the people, were unto the book of the law.

4. And Ezra the scribe stood upon a lofty platform of wood, which they had made for the purpose, and there stood, beside him, Mattithiah and Shema and Anaiah and Uriah and Hilkiah and Maaseiah, on his right hand,and, on his left, Pedaiah and Mishael and Malchijah and Hashum and Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, Meshullam.

5. And Ezra the scribe opened the book before the eyes of all the people, for, above all the people, was he,and, when he opened it, all the people, stood up.

6. And Ezra blessed Yahweh the great God,and all the people responded, Amen! Amen! with the lifting up of their hands,and they bent their heads and bowed themselves down unto Yahweh, with their faces to the ground.

7. And, Jeshua and Bani and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, did cause the people to understand the law, the people, remaining in their places.

8. So they read in the book of the law of God, distinctly,and, giving the sense, caused them to understand the reading.

9. Then Nehemiahhe, was the governorand Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites who were causing the people to understand, said unto all the people, To-day, is, holy, unto Yahweh your God, do not mourn, nor weep,for, weeping, were all the people, when they heard the words of the law.

10. So he said unto themGo your way, eat the fat and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared, for holy is the day, unto our Lord,and be not grieved, for, the joy of Yahweh, is your strength.

11. And, the Levites, were quieting all the people, sayingHush! for, the day, is holy,and be not grieved.

12. And all the people went their way, to eat and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great rejoicing,because they had understood the words which were made known unto them.

13. And, on the second day, were gathered togetherthe ancestral heads of all the people, the priests and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe,even to give attention unto the words of the law.

14. And they found written in the law,that Yahweh gave command through Moses, that the sons of Israel should dwell in booths, during the festival of the seventh month;

15. and that they should publish and send along a proclamation throughout all their cities and throughout Jerusalem, saying, Forth to the mountain, and bring in branches of olive, and branches of oleaster, and branches of myrtle, and branches of palms, and branches of thick trees,to make booths, as it is written.

16. So the people went forth, and brought in, and made themselves booths, every one upon his roof, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the broad place of the water-gate, and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim.

17. And all the convocation of them who had returned out of the captivity made booths, and dwelt in booths, for, since the days of Jeshua son of Nun, had not the sons of Israel done so, unto that day,and there was very great rejoicing.

18. So he read in the book of the law of God, day by day, from the first day unto the last day, and they kept the festival seven days, and, on the eighth day, a closing feast, according to the regulation.

## Nehemiah 9

1. Now, on the twenty-fourth day of this month, were the sons of Israel gathered together, with fasting and with sackcloth, having earth upon them.

2. And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all the sons of the foreigner,and stood and made confession over their own sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.

3. So they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of Yahweh their God, a fourth part of the day,and, a fourth part, they were making confession and bowing themselves down, unto Yahweh their God.

4. Then stood up on the platform of the Levites, Jeshua and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, Chenani,and made outcry, with a loud voice, unto Yahweh their God.

5. Then said the LevitesJeshua and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, Pethahiah, Stand up, bless Yahweh your God, from age to age,Yea let them bless thy glorious Name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.

6. Thou, art Yahweh, thou alone, Thou, didst make the heavens, the heavens of heavens, and all their host, the earth and all that is thereon, the seas and all that is therein, and, thou, holdest them all in life,and, the host of the heavens, unto thee, are bowing down.

7. Thou, art Yahweh, God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees,and madest his name Abraham;

8. and didst find his heart faithful before thee, and didst solemnize with him a covenant, to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite,to give it unto his seed,and didst confirm thy words, for, righteous, thou art.

9. Yea thou sawest the affliction of our fathers, in Egypt, and, their outcry, thou heardest, by the Red Sea;

10. and didst grant signs and wonders against Pharaoh, and against all his servants, and against all the people of his land, for thou hadst taken note, that they ruled proudly over them,and so thou didst make thee a name, as at this day.

11. And, the sea, didst thou cleave asunder before them, and they passed through the midst of the sea, on dry ground,whereas, their pursuers, thou didst cast into the depths like a stone, into the mighty waters,

12. And, in a pillar of cloud, didst thou lead them, by day,and in a pillar of fire, by night, to light up for them the way wherein they should go.

13. And, upon Mount Sinai, camest thou down, and spakest with them out of the heavens,and gavest them just regulations, and faithful laws, good statutes and commandments.

14. And, thy holy sabbath, didst thou make known to them,and, commandments and statutes and a law, didst thou command them, through Moses thy servant.

15. And, bread out of the heavens, didst thou give them, for their hunger, and, waters out of the cliff, didst thou bring them, for their thirst,and badest them go in to take possession of the land, which thou hadst lifted thy hand to give them.

16. But, they and our fathers, dealt proudly,and hardened their neck, and hearkened not unto thy commandments;

17. but refused to hearken, neither kept in mind thy wonders which thou hadst done with them, but they hardened their neck, and appointed a head that they might return to their servitude, in their perverseness. But, thou, art a God of forgivenesses, gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness, and didst not forsake them.

18. Yea, although they made them a molten calf, and said, This, is thy God, that brought thee up out of Egypt,and wrought great insults,

19. yet, thou, in thine abounding compassions, didst not forsake them in the desert,the pillar of cloud, departed not from over them by day, to lead them in the way, nor the pillar of fire by night, to light up for them the way wherein they should go.

20. And, thy Good Spirit, thou gavest, to instruct them,and, thy manna, thou withheldest not from their mouth, and, water, thou gavest them, for their thirst.

21. Yea, forty years, didst thou sustain them in the desert, they lacked nothing,their mantles, waxed not old and, their feet, swelled not.

22. And thou gavest them kingdoms, and peoples, and allotted to each of them a corner,and they took possession of the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.

23. Their children also, didst thou multiply, like the stars of the heavens,and didst bring them into the land which thou hadst promised their fathers they should enter to possess;

24. so the children entered and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and deliveredst them into their hand,with their kings, and the peoples of the land, to do with them according to their pleasure;

25. and they captured fortified cities and a fat soil, and took possession of houses full of every good thing, wells digged, vineyards and oliveyards and fruit-trees, in abundance,so they did eat and were filled and became fat, and luxuriated in thy great goodness.

26. But they murmured and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their back, and, thy prophets, they slew, who testified against them that they might turn them back unto thee,and they wrought great insults.

27. Therefore didst thou deliver them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them,and, in the time of their distress, they made outcry unto thee, and, thou, out of the heavens, didst hear, and, according to thine abounding compassions, gavest them saviors, that they might save them out of the hand of their adversaries.

28. But, as soon as they had rest, they again wrought wickedness before thee,and thou didst leave them in the hand of their enemies, who bare rule over them, yet, when they again made outcry unto thee, thou, from the heavens, didst hear and didst deliver them according to thy compassions, many times;

29. and didst testify against them, to bring them back unto thy law, yet, they, dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, and, against thy regulations, they sinned, the whichif any son of earth shall dothen shall he live by them,and yielded a rebellious shoulder, and, their neck, they stiffened, and hearkened not.

30. And thou didst suffer many years to pass over them, and didst testify against them by thy Spirit through thy prophets, yet did they not give ear,therefore didst thou deliver them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.

31. Yet, in thine abounding compassions, thou didst not make of them an end, neither didst thou forsake them,for, a GOD gracious and full of compassion, thou art.

32. Now, therefore, O our Godthe GOD great, mighty, and fearfulkeeping the covenant and the lovingkindness, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, which hath come upon uson our kings, on our rulers, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people,from the days of the kings of Assyria, until this day.

33. But, thou, art righteous, as to all that hath fallen upon us,for, faithfulness, hast thou wrought, whereas, we, have been lawless;

34. and, our kings, our rulers, our priests, and our fathers, have not kept thy law,nor given heed unto thy commandments, or unto thy testimonies, wherewith thou hast testified against them.

35. But, they, in their kingdom, and in thine abundant goodness which thou gavest them, and in the broad and fat land which thou didst set before them, did not serve thee, neither turned they from their wicked doings.

36. Lo! we, to-day, are bondmeneven upon the land which thou gavest our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, lo! we, are bondmen;

37. and, the increase thereof, aboundeth unto the kings whom thou hast set over us, for our sins,and, over our bodies, are they bearing rule, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and, in great distress, we are.

38. Seeing, therefore, all this, we, are plighting our faith, and putting it in writing,and, upon the sealed scroll, are our rulers, our Levites, our priests.

28. And, the rest of the peoplethe priests, the Levites, the doorkeepers, the singers, the Nethinim, and all who had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands unto the law of God, their wives, their sons and their daughters,every one having knowledge and understanding,

29. were holding fast unto their distinguished brethren, and were entering into a curse and into an oath, to walk in the law of God, which was given through Moses the servant of God,and to observe and do, all the commandments of Yahweh our Lord, and his regulations, and his statutes;

30. and that we would not give our daughters unto the peoples of the land,and, their daughters, would we not take for our sons;

31. and, if the peoples of the land should be bringing in wares, or any corn on the sabbath day, to sell, we would not buy of them on the sabbath, or on a holy day,and that we would remit the seventh year, and the loan of every hand.

32. And we laid on ourselves charges, appointing for ourselves the third of a shekel, yearly,for the service of the house of our God:

33. for the bread to set in array, and the continual meal-offering, and for the continual ascending-sacrifice, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the appointed feasts, and for things hallowed, and for victims bearing sin, to put a propitiatory-covering over Israel,and for all the work of the house of our God.

34. Also, lots, did we cast, concerning the offering of wood among the priests, the Levites, and the people, to bring it unto the house of our God, by our ancestral houses, at times arranged, year by year,to burn upon the altar of Yahweh our God, as it is written in the law.

35. And that we would bring in the firstfruits of our ground, and the firstfruit of all fruit of all trees, year by year,unto the house of Yahweh;

36. also that, the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written in the law,and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, we would bring in unto the house of our God, unto the priests who should be in attendance in the house of our God;

37. and, the first part of our meal and our heave-offerings and the fruit of all trees, new wine and oil, would we bring in unto the priests, into the chambers of the house of our God, and the tithe of our ground unto the Levites,the Levites themselves, taking the tithes in all our cities of agriculture.

38. And the priest the son of Aaron should be with the Levites, when the Levites should take the tithes,and the Levites, should bring up the tithe of the tithe, unto the house of our God, into the chambers pertaining unto the treasure-house.

39. For, into the chambers, should the sons of Israel and the sons of Levi bring in the heave-offering of the corn, the new wine and the oil, since, there, are the utensils of the sanctuary, and the priests who are in attendance, and the doorkeepers, and the singers,so would we not neglect the house of our God.

## Nehemiah 11

1. And the rulers of the people dwelt in Jerusalem,and, the rest of the people, cast lots, to bring in one out of ten to dwell in Jerusalem, the holy city, and nine parts in   cities.

20. But, the residue of Israel, the priests, the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance.

21. Howbeit, the Nethinim, were dwelling in Ophel,and, Ziha and Gishpa, were over the Nethinim.

22. And, the overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem, was Uzzi son of Bani, son of Hashabiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Mica,of the sons of Asaph the singers, to take lead in the business of the house of God.

23. For, the commandment of the king, was upon them,as to a fixed provision for the singers, the need of a day upon its day.

24. And, Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah, son of Judah, was at the hand of the king, in every matter pertaining to the people.

9. and Bakbukiah and Unno their brethren, were over against them, in wards.

10. And Jeshua, begat Joiakim,and Joiakim, begat Eliashib, and, Eliashib,   Joiada;

11. and, Joiada, begat Jonathan,and, Jonathan, begat Jaddua.

12. And, in the days of Joiakim, were priests, ancestral chiefs,of Seraiah, Meraiah, of Jeremiah, Hananiah;

22. The Levitesin the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, were recorded as ancestral chiefs,also the priests, unto the reign of Darius the Persian.

23. the sons of Levi, ancestral heads, were written in the book of Chronicles,even until the days of Johanan, son of Eliashib.

24. And, the chiefs of the Levites, Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praiseto give thanks, by the commandment of David the man of God,ward joined to ward.

25. Mattaniah and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were watchers, doorkeepers of the ward, in the storehouses of the gates.

26. These, were in the days of Joiakim, son of Jeshua, son of Jozadak,and in the days of Nehemiah the pasha, and Ezra the priest the scribe.

27. And, at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they sought the Levites, out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem,to keep the dedication and the rejoicing, both with thanksgiving and with music, cymbals, harps, and with lyres.

28. So the sons of the singers gathered themselves together,both out of the circuit round about Jerusalem, and out of the villages of the Netophathites;

29. also out of Beth-gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba, and Azmaveth,for, villages, had the singers builded for themselves, round about Jerusalem.

30. And the priests and the Levites purified themselves,and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.

31. Then brought I up the rulers of Judah upon the wall,and I appointed two large choirs, even to go in procession to the right, upon the wall, towards the dung-gate;

32. and after them went Hoshaiah, and half the rulers of Judah;

33. then Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam;

34. Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah;

35. and, of the sons of the priests, with trumpets, Zechariahson of Jonathanson of Shemaiahson of Mattaniah, son of Micaiah, son of Zaccur, son of Asaph;

36. and his brethrenShemaiah and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, with the instruments of music of David, the man of God,with Ezra the scribe before them;

37. and, over they fountain gate and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall,above the house of David, even as far as the water-gate, eastward.

38. And, the second choir, was going over against them, I, following it,with the half of the people upon the wall, above the tower of the ovens, even as far as the broad wall;

39. and above the gate of Ephraim, and upon the old gate, and upon the fish-gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even as far as the sheep-gate,and they came to a stand, at the gate of the guard.

40. So the two choirs, came to a stand, at the house of God,and I, and half the deputies with me;

41. and, the priestsEliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;

42. and Maaseiah and Shemaiah and Eleazar and Uzzi and Jehohanan and Malchijah and Elam and Ezer,and the musicians sounded, aloud with Jezrahiah who was over them.

43. And they sacrificed, on that day, great sacrifices, and rejoiced, for, God, had caused them to rejoice with great joy, moreover also, the women and children, rejoiced,so that the rejoicing of Jerusalem was heard afar off.

44. And there were sot in charge, on that day, certain men, over the chambers for the treasures, for the heave-offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, out of the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law, for the priests, and for the Levites,for, the joy of Judah, was over the priests and over the Levites, who were remaining.

45. So they kept the charge of their God, and the charge of the purification, and   the singers and the doorkeepers,according to the commandment of David and his son.

46. For, in the days of David and Asaph, of old, there were chiefs of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving, unto God.

47. Now, all Israelin the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, used to give the portions of the singers and the doorkeepers, the need of a day upon its day,and they hallowed them unto the Levites, and, the Levites, hallowed them unto the sons of Aaron.

## Nehemiah 13

1. On that day, a portion, was read in the book of Moses, in the ears of the people,and it was found written therein, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not enter into the convocation of God, unto times age-abiding;

2. because they met not the sons of Israel, with bread and with water,but hired against them Balaam, to curse them, although our God turned the curse into a blessing.

3. So it came to pass, when they had heard the law,that they separated all the mixed multitude from Israel.

4. Now, before this, Eliashib the priest, who was set over a chamber of the house of God, was allied unto Tobiah;

5. so he prepared him a large chamber, where aforetime they used to lay the meal-offering, the frankincense, and the utensils, and the tithe of the corn, the new wine and the oil, in charge of the Levites, and the singers, and the doorkeepers,and the heave-offerings for the priests.

6. But, throughout all this   , was I not in Jerusalem,for, in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon, I came unto the king, and, at the end of certain days, obtained I leave of the king;

7. and came to Jerusalem,and had intelligence of the wickedness which Eliashib had committed for Tobiah, in preparing for him a chamber, in the courts of the house of God;

8. and it grieved me exceedingly,and I cast forth all the household utensils of Tobiah, outside of the chamber.

9. Then commanded I, and they purified the chambers,and I put back there, the utensils of the house of God, the meal-offering and the frankincense.

10. Then came I to know, that, the portions of the Levites, had not been given   ,so that the Levites and the singers, who had been doing the work, had fled every one to his field.

11. Therefore contended I with the deputies, and said, Wherefore is the house of God, forsaken? So I gathered them together, and set them in their place.

12. Then, all Judah, brought in the tithe of corn, and new wine, and oil, unto the treasuries;

13. and I made treasurers over the treasuriesShelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah from among the Levites, and, next unto them, Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah,for faithful were they accounted, and it was   upon them to distribute unto their brethren.

14. Remember me, O my God, concerning this,and do not wipe out my lovingkindnesses, which I have done for the house of my God, and for those keeping charge thereof.

15. In those days, saw I in Judahsome treading winepresses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves and lading asses, moreover also wine, grapes, and figs, and every kind of burden, which they were bringing into Jerusalem on the sabbath day,so I protested against it, as a day for them to sell provisions.

16. And, men of Tyre, dwelt therein, who were bringing in fishand every kind of ware for sale,and were selling, on the sabbath, to the sons of Judah, and in Jerusalem;

17. so I contended with the nobles of Judah,and said unto them, What is this wicked thing which, ye, are doing, and profaning the sabbath day?

18. Was it not, thus, your fathers did, and our God brought upon us all this calamity, and upon this city?and, ye, would add indignation against Israel, by profaning the sabbath!

19. And it came to pass, when the gates of Jerusalem made a shadow before the sabbath, then gave I word, and they shut the doors, and I gave word, that they should not open them, until after the sabbath,and, some of my young men, set I near the gates, so that no burden should be brought in, on the sabbath day.

20. But the traders and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.

21. Therefore I testified against them, and said unto them, Wherefore are ye lodging against the wall? if ye do it again, a hand, will I thrust upon you,From that time, they came not on the sabbath.

22. And I gave word to the Levites, that they should be purifying themselves and coming in, as keepers of the gates, to hallow the sabbath day. This also, remember to me, O my God, and have pity upon me, according to the abundance of thy lovingkindness.

23. Moreover, in these days, saw I the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, of Moab;

24. and, their children, were one-half speaking the language of Ashdod, and understood not how to speak the language of the Jews,but after the tongue of both people.

25. So I contended with them, and laid a curse upon them, and I smote, from among them, certain men, and pulled out their hair,and I put them on oath by God, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take of their daughters, for your sons nor for yourselves.

26. Was it not, over these things, that Solomon king of Israel sinnedthough, among many nations, there was no king such as he, and he was, beloved by his God, and so God gave him to be king over all Israel,even him, did foreign women, cause to sin.

27. Unto you, then, shall we hearken, to do all this great wickedness, to act unfaithfully with our God,by marrying foreign wives?

28. And, one of the sons of Joiada, son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite,therefore I chased him from me.

29. Remember them, O my God,on account of the Defilings of the Priesthood, and the Covenant of the Priesthood, and of the Levites.

30. So I purified them from everything foreign,and appointed charges unto the priests and unto the Levites, every one in his work;

31. also for the offering of wood, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good!
