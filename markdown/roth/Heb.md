## Hebrews 1

__All they who are with me salute thee. Salute thou them who regard us with faithful affection. Favour, be with you all.__

1. Whereas, in many parts and in many ways of old, God spake unto the fathers, in the prophets,

2. At the end of these days, He hath spoken unto us in his Son,whom he hath appointed heir of all things, through whom also he hath made the ages;

3. Who, being an eradiated brightness of his glory, and an exact representation of his very being, also bearing up all things by the utterance of his power, purification of sins, having achieved, sat down on the right hand of the majesty in high places:

4. By so much becoming superior to the messengers, by as much as, going beyond them, he hath inherited a more distinguished name.

5. For unto which of the messengers said he at any timeMy Son, art, thou, I, this day have begotten thee? and againI, will become, his father, and, he, shall become my Son?

6. But, whensoever he again introduceth the first-begotten into the habitable earth, he saithAnd let all Gods messengers worship him!

7. Even as to the messengers, indeed, he saithWho maketh his messengers, winds, and his ministers of state, a fiery flame;

8. but, as to the Son,Thy throne, O God, is unto times age-abiding, andA sceptre of equity, is the sceptre of his kingdom,

9. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated lawlessness,For this cause, hath God, thy God, anointed thee with the oil of exultation, beyond thy partners;

10. andThou, by way of beginning, Lord, the earth, didst found, and, the works of thy hands, are the heavens,

11. They, shall perish, but, thou, abidest still, and, all, as a mantle, shall be worn out,

12. And, as if a robe, wilt thou fold them up,as a mantle, and they shall be changed; but, thou, art the same, and thy years shall not fail.

13. But, to which of the messengers, hath he said, at any timeSit thou at my right hand, until I make thy foes thy footstool?

14. Are they not, all, spirits, doing public service,for ministry, sent forth, for the sake of them who are about to inherit salvation?

## Hebrews 2

1. For this cause, it behoveth us, with unwonted firmness, to be holding fast unto the things that have been heard, lest, at any time, we drift away.

2. For, if the word through messengers spoken became firm, and, every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense,

3. how shall, we, escape, if, so great a salvation as this, we have neglected,which, indeed, having received, a beginning, of being spoken through the Lord, by them who heard, unto us was confirmed,

4. God, jointly witnessing also, both with signs and wonders and manifold mighty works, and with distributions of Holy Spirit, according to his own will?

5. For, not unto messengers, hath he subjected the coming habitable earth of which we are speaking;

6. But one somewhere hath borne witness, sayingWhat is man, that thou shouldst make mention of him? Or the son of man, that thou shouldst put him in charge?

7. Thou hast made him less, some little, than messengers, With glory and honour, hast thou crowned him, And hast set him over the works of thy hands ;

8. All things, hast thou subjected beneath his feet. For, in subjecting,  to him  the all things, nothing, left he, to him unsubjected; But now, not yet, do we see, to him, the all things subjected;

9. But, Jesus, made some little less than messengers, we do behold: by reason of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour, to the end that, by favour of God, in behalf of every one, he might taste of death.

10. For it was becoming in himFor the sake of whom are the all things, and by means of whom are the all things,when, many sons, unto glory, he would lead, The Princely Leader of their salvation, through sufferings, to make perfect.

11. For, both he that maketh holy, and they who are being made holy, are, all, of One; For which cause, he is not ashamed to be calling them, brethren,

12. sayingI will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of an assembly, will I sing praise unto thee;

13. and againI, will be confident upon him; and againLo! I, and the children which, unto me, God, hath given.

14. Seeing therefore the children have received a fellowship of blood and flesh, he also, in like manner, took partnership in the same,in order that, through death,he might paralyse him that held the dominion of death, that is, the Adversary,

15. And might release theseas many as, by fear of death, were all their lifetime liable, to bondage.

16. For, not surely of messengers, is he laying hold, but, of Abrahams seed, he is laying hold.

17. Whence he was obliged, in every way, unto the brethren, to be made like, that he might become a merciful and faithful high-priest, in the things pertaining unto God,for the making of propitiation for the sins of the people.

18. For, in that, he, suffered when tested, he is able, unto them who are being tested, to give succour.

## Hebrews 3

1. Whence, holy brethren, partners, in a heavenly calling, attentively consider the Apostle and Highpriest of our confessionJesus

2. As one, faithful, to him who made him: as, Moses also, in  all  his house.

3. For, of more glory than Moses, hath, this one been counted worthyby as much as more honour than, the house, hath, he that prepared it;

4. For, every house, is prepared by someone,but, he that hath prepared all things, is, God.

5. Even Moses, indeed, was faithful in all his house, as an attendant, for a witness of the things which were to be spoken;

6. But, Christ, as, a Son, over his house,whose house are, we,if, the freedom of speech and boast of the hope,  throughout, firm,  we hold fast.

7. Wherefore,according as saith the Holy SpiritTo-day, if, unto his voice ye would hearken, do not

8. harden your hearts,as in the embitterment, in the day of testing in the desert,

9. When your fathers tested by proving, and saw my works forty years.

10. Wherefore I was sore vexed with this generation, and said, Always err they in their heart;howbeit, they, learned not my ways:

11. So I sware in mine angerthey shall not enter into my rest!

12. Be taking heed, brethren, lest at any time, there shall be in any one of you, a wicked heart of unbelief, in revolting from a Living God.

13. But be exhorting one another, on each successive day,while the To-day is being named! lest any from among you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

14. For, partners of the Christ, have we become,if, at least, the beginning of the confidence, throughout, firm, we hold fast:

15. So long as it is saidTo-day, if, unto his voice, ye would hearken, do not harden your hearts,as in the embitterment.

16. For, who, though they heard, caused embitterment? Nay, indeed! did not all who come forth out of Egypt through Moses?

17. But, with whom, was be sore vexed forty years? Was it not with them who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the desert?

18. But, unto whom, sware he, that they should not enter into his rest,save unto them who were obstinate?

19. And we see, that they were not able to enter, because of unbelief.

## Hebrews 4

1. Let us therefore fear, lest at any time, although there is left behind a promise of entering into his rest,any one from amongst you should be deemed, to have come short;

2. For we have had delivered to us the joyful message, just as even, they; but the word which was heard did not profit them, they not having been blended, by faith, with the things heard.

3. For we who have believed, are to enter into the rest, according as he hath saidSo I sware in mine anger, They shall not enter into my rest; And yet, the works, from the foundation of the world, had been brought into existence,

4. For he hath spoken, somewhere, concerning the seventh   , thusAnd God rested, on the seventh day, from all his works;

5. And in this againThey shall not enter into my rest.

6. Seeing, therefore, that it is left over for, some, to enter into it, and, they who formerly had delivered to them the joyful message, entered not in by reason of obstinacy,

7. Again, he marketh out a certain day, To-day, in David, sayingafter so long a time as this,according as it hath been said before:To-day, if, unto his voice, ye would hearken, do not harden your hearts.

8. For, if, unto them, Joshua had given rest, it had not in that case, concerning another day, been speaking, after, these things.

9. Hence there is, left over, a Sabbath-keeping, for the people of God.

10. For, he that hath entered into his rest, He too, hath rested from his works, just as, from his own, God,

11. Let us, therefore, give diligence to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall into the same example, of obstinacy.

12. For, living, is the word of God, and, energetic, and more cutting than any knife with two edges, and penetrating as far as a dividing asunder of soul and spirit, of joints also, and marrow, and able to judge the impulses and designs of the heart;

13. And there is, no created thing, can be secreted before him, but, all things, are naked and exposed to his eyes:as to whom is, our discourse.

14. Having then a great high-priest who hath passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession;

15. For we have not a high-priest unable to have fellow-feeling with our weaknesses, but one tested in all respects, by way of likeness, apart from sin.

16. Let us, then, be approaching with freedom of speech, unto the throne of favour, that we may receive mercy, and, favour, may find, for seasonable succour.

## Hebrews 5

1. For, every high-priest who from among men is taken, on behalf of men, is appointed, as to the things pertaining unto God, that he may be offering  both  gifts and sacrifices for sins,

2. Able, to have a measure of feeling, for the ignorant and erring,since, he also, is compassed with weakness;

3. And, for this cause, is he obligedas for the people, so also, for himself,to be offering for sins;

4. And, not unto himself, doth one take the honour, but when called by God, just as, even Aaron:

5. Thus, also the Christ, glorified not himself to become a high-priest, but he that spake unto himMy Son, art, thou, I, this day, have begotten thee;

6. As also, in a different place, he saithThou, art a priest, age-abidingly, according to the rank of Melchizedek:

7. Who, in the days of his flesh, having offered up, both supplications and entreaties unto him that was able to save him out of death, with mighty outcries and tears, and been hearkened to by reason of his devoutness,

8. Even though he was a son, yet learned, from what things he suffered, obedience;

9. And, being made perfect, became, to all them that obey him, Author of salvation age-abiding;

10. Being addressed by God as high-priestaccording to the rank of Melchizedek.

11. Concerning whom, great, is our discourse, and of difficult interpretation, to express, seeing that, slothful, have ye become in the hearing;

12. For, even when ye ought to be teachers, by reason of the time, again, have ye, need, that one be teaching, you, what are the first principles of the oracles of God, and have become such as have, need, of milk, not, of strong food;

13. For, every one partaking of milk, is unskilled in discourse of righteousness, for he is, a babe;

14. But, to such as are mature, pertaineth, the strong food, to them who, by reason of habit, have their organs of perception well trained for discriminating both good and evil.

## Hebrews 6

1. Wherefore, dismissing the elementary discourse concerning the Christ, unto maturity, let us be tending, not, again, a foundation, laying downof repentance from dead works, and of faith towards God,

2. Of immersionsin respect of teaching, and of the laying on of hands, of the resurrection of the dead, and of judgment age-abiding;

3. And, this, will we do, if at least, God, permit.

4. For it is impossibleas to these who have been, once for all, illuminated, who have tasted also of the heavenly free-gift, and have been made, partners, in a Holy Spirit,

5. And have tasted Gods utterance to be, sweet, mighty works also of a coming age,

6. And who have fallen away, again, to be remoulding them into repentance; seeing they are again crucifying unto themselves the Son of God, and holding him up as an example.

7. For, land, which hath drunk in, the rain, thereupon ofttimes coming, and which bringeth forth vegetation fit for them for whom it is even cultivated, partaketh of a blessing from God;

8. But, should it be bringing forth thorns and briars, it is disapproved, and, unto cursing, nigh,whose end is for burning.

9. But we are persuaded, concerning you, beloved, the things which are better and which contain salvation, though, even thus we speak.

10. For, not unrighteous, is God, to be forgetful of your work and of the love which ye have shewn forth for his name, in that ye have ministered unto the saints, and are ministering,

11. But we covet that, each one of you, be shewing forth the same diligence, unto the full assurance of the hope throughout:

12. In order that, not slothful, ye may become, but imitators of them who, through faith and patience, were becoming heirs of the promises.

13. For, when to Abraham God made promise, seeing he had no one greater by whom to swear, He sware, by himself,

14. sayingTruly, if blessing I will bless thee, and, multiplying, I will multiply thee;

15. And, thus, being patient, he attained unto the promise.

16. For, men, by the greater one, swear, and, with them, an end of all gainsaying by way of confirmation is, the oath:

17. Wherein God, being, more abundantly disposed to shew forth unto the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his counsel, mediated, with an oath,

18. In order that, through means of two unchangeable things, in which it was impossible for God to make himself false, a mighty consolation, we might have, who have fled along to grasp, the fore-lying hope,

19. Which we have, as an anchor of the soul, both secure and firm, and entering into the interior of the veil:

20. Where a forerunner in our behalf hath entered, even Jesus, who, according to the rank of Melchizedek, hath become, a high-priest unto times age-abiding.

## Hebrews 7

1. For, this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,

2. To whom even a tenth of all Abraham apportioned, first, indeed, when translated, King of Righteousness, but, after that, King of Salem also, which is King of Peace,

3. Without father, without mother, without pedigree, having, neither beginning of days, nor of life an end, but made like unto the Son of God, abideth a priest evermore.

4. Now consider, how great, this man was, to whom, a tenth, Abraham gave out of the choicest spoils,   the Patriarch.

5. And, they, indeed, from among the sons of Levi who the priesthood receive, have commandment to take tithes of the people, according to the law, that is, of their brethren, although sprung from the loins of Abraham;

6. But, he who deriveth not his pedigree from among them, hath taken tithes of Abraham. And, the holder of the promises, hath he blessed.

7. But, apart from all gainsaying, the less, by the greater, is blessed.

8. And, here, indeed, dying men take tithes, but, there, one of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.

9. Andso to say a wordthrough Abraham, even Levi who taketh tithes hath paid tithes;

10. For, even then, was he, in the loins of his father, when, Melchizedek, met him.

11. If indeed, therefore, there had been, a perfecting through means of the Levitical priesthood,for, the people, thereon, have had based a code of laws, what further need, according to the rank of Melchizedek, for a different priest to be raised up, and, not according to the rank of Aaron, to be designated?

12. For, seeing there is to be a change of the priesthood, of necessity, of law too, a change cometh.

13. For, he as to whom these things are said, with a different tribe, hath taken partnership, from which, no one, hath given attendance at the altar;

14. For it is, very evident, that out of Judah hath sprung our Lord,respecting which tribe, concerning priests, nothing did Moses speak,

15. And, yet more abundantly evident it isthat, according to the likeness of Melchizedek, there is to be raised up, a different priest.

16. Who, not according to a law of commandment dealing with the flesh, hath arisen, but according to the power of an indissoluble life;

17. For it is witnessedThou, art a priest, age-abidingly, according to the rank of Melchizedek.

18. For, a setting aside, doth, indeed, take place, of a foregoing commandment, by reason of its own weakness and unprofitableness,

19. For, the law, perfected, nothing; but there is the superinducing of a better hope,through which we draw near unto God.

20. And, inasmuch as not apart from oath-taking

21. For, they, indeed, apart from oath-taking, have been made priests, but, he, with an oath-taking, through him that was saying unto himThe Lord sware, and will not regret,Thou, art a priest, age-abidingly

22. By as much as this, hath, Jesus, become surety of a better covenant also.

23. And, they, indeed, in greater numbers, have been made priests, because, by reason of death, are they hindered from remaining at hand;

24. But, he, by reason of his remaining age-abidingly, untransmissible, holdeth, the priesthood.

25. Whence he is able, even to be saving unto the very end, them who approach, through him, unto God; Since he evermore liveth to be interceding in their behalf.

26. For, such a high-priest as this, for us, was  even  suited: Loving, noble, undefiled, set apart from sinners, and become, higher than the heavens;

27. Who hath no daily necessity, like the high-priests, beforehand, over his own sins, to be offering sacrifices, after that, over those, of the people,for, this, he did once for all when, himself, he offered up.

28. For, the law, constituteth, men, high-priests, having, weakness; but, the word of the oath-taking, which cometh after the law, A Son, age-abidingly, made perfect.

## Hebrews 8

1. A crowning point on the things being spoken:such a one as this, have we, as high-priest, who hath sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,

2. Of the Holy place, a public minister, and of the Real Tent, which, the Lord, pitched and not man.

3. For, every high-priest, for the offering of both gifts and sacrifices, is constituted; whence it was necessary for, this one also, to have something which he might offer.

4. If, indeed, therefore, he had been on earth, he had not, in that case, even been a priest, since there are those who are offering the gifts, according to the law:

5. Who, indeed, are rendering divine service, with a glimpse and shadow, of the heavenly things; even as Moses hath received intimation, when about to complete the tent,For see! saith heThou shalt make all things according to the model which hath been pointed out to thee in the mount.

6. But, now, hath he attained unto, a more distinguished public ministry,by as much as of a better covenant also he is, mediator, which indeed, upon better promises, hath been legislated.

7. For, if, that first, had been, faultless, not, in that case, for a second, had there been sought, a place.

8. For, finding fault with them, he saithLo! days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will conclude, for the house of Israel and the house of Judah, a covenant of a new sort:

9. Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day when I took them by their hand, to lead them forth out of the land of Egypt,because, they, abode not in my covenant, and, I, disregarded them, saith the Lord.

10. Because, this, is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, saith the Lord:giving my laws into their understanding, upon their hearts also, will I inscribe them: and I will become their God, and, they, shall become my people;

11. And in nowise shall they teachevery one his fellow-citizen, and every one his brother, saying,Get to know the Lord! Because, all, shall know me, from the least unto the greatest of them;

12. Because, propitious, will I be as to their unrighteousnesses, and, of their sins, in nowise will I be mindful, any more.

13. In saying, Of a new sort, he hath made obsolete, the first; but, the thing that is becoming obsolete and aged, is near, disappearing!

## Hebrews 9

1. the first, indeed, therefore, used to have righteous appointments of divine service, even the holy ritual well arranged.

2. For a tent was prepared, the first, in which were both the lampstand and the table and the setting forth of the loaves,the which is called the Holy place;

3. But, after the second veil, a tent, that which is called Most Holy:

4. Having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant covered around on every side with gold, in which was a golden jar holding the manna, and the rod of Aaron that sprouted, and the tables of the covenant;

5. But, over-above it, Cherubim of glory overshadowing the propitiatory:concerning which things, it is not now   to be speaking, particularly.

6. Now, these things having been thus prepared, into the first tent, indeed, continually do the priests enter, the divine services completing;

7. But, into the second, once for all in the year, only the high-priest, not without blood, which he offered for himself and the ignorances of the people:

8. The Holy Spirit making this evidentthat, not yet, hath been manifested, the way through the Holy place, so long as the first tent hath a standing.

9. The which is a similitude for the present season, according to which both gifts and sacrifices are offered, which cannot, as to the conscience, perfect him that rendereth the divine service:

10. Only as to eatings, and drinkings, and diversified immersions,righteous-appointments of the flesh, which, until a season of rectifying, are in force.

11. But, when Christ approached, as high-priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tent, not made by hand, that is, not of this creation,

12. Nor yet through blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood he entered once for all into the Holy place, age-abiding redemption discovering.

13. For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the profaned, halloweth unto the purity of the flesh,

14. How much rather shall the blood of the Christ, who through an age-abiding spirit offered himself unspotted unto God, purify our conscience from dead works, to the rendering of divine-service, unto a Living God?

15. And, for this cause, of a new covenant, is he mediator,to the end that, death coming to pass for the redemption of the transgressions against the first covenant, the called might receive the promise of the age-abiding inheritance;

16. For, where a covenant is, it is necessary for, the death, to be brought in, of him that hath covenanted;

17. For, a covenant over dead persons, is firm,since it is not then of force when he is living that hath covenanted.

18. Whence, not even the first, apart from blood, hath been consecrated;

19. For, when every commandment according to the law had been spoken by Moses unto all the people, taking the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, both, the scroll itself, and all the people, he sprinkled;

20. SayingThis, is the blood of the covenant which, God, hath sent in command unto you:

21. Yea, the tent also, and all the utensils of the public ministry, with blood, in like manner, he sprinkled:

22. And, nearly, all things, with blood, are purified, according to the law, and, apart from blood-shedding, cometh no remission.

23. It was indeed therefore necessary for the glimpses of the things in the heavens with these to be purified; but, the heavenly things themselves, with better sacrifices than these.

24. For, not into a Holy place made by hand, entered Christ,counterpart of the real   ; but, into the heaven itself, now, to be plainly manifested before the face of God in our behalf;

25. Nor yet that, ofttimes, he should be offering himself,just as the high-priest entereth into the Holy place, year by year, with alien blood;

26. Else had it been needful for him, ofttimes, to suffer, from the foundation of the world; but, now, once for all, upon a conjunction of the ages, for a setting aside of sin through means of his sacrifice, hath he been made manifest;

27. And, inasmuch as it is in store for menonce for all to die, but after this, judgment,

28. Thus, the Christ also, once for all having been offered, for the bearing of the sins, of many, a second time, apart from sin, will appear, to them who for him are ardently waitingunto salvation.

## Hebrews 10

1. For the law, having in a shadow of the destined good things, not the very image of the things, they can never, with the same sacrifices which year by year they offer evermore, make them who approach, perfect;

2. Else would they not, in that case, have ceased being offered, by reason of those rendering the divine service having no further conscience at all of sins, being once for all purified?

3. But, in them, is a recalling to mind of sins, year by year,

4. For it is impossible for blood of bulls and goats to be taking away sins.

5. Wherefore, coming into the world, he saith: Sacrifice and offering, thou willedst not, but, a body, hast thou fitted for me,

6. In whole-burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sins, thou didst not delight:

7. Then, said ILo! I am come,in the heading of the scroll, it is written concerning me,to do, O God, thy will.

8. Higher up, sayingSacrifices, and offerings, and whole-burnt-offerings, and sacrifices for sins, thou willedst not, neither delightedst in,the which, according to the law, are offered,

9. Then, hath he saidLo! I am come! to do, thy will:he taketh away the first, that, the second, he may establish:

10. By which will, we have been made holy, through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all.

11. And, every priest, indeed, standeth daily publicly ministering, and the same sacrifices ofttimes offering, the which never can clear away sins;

12. But this priest, having offered one sacrifice for sins evermore, sat down on the right hand of God:

13. As for the rest, waitinguntil his foes be made his footstool;

14. For, by one offering, hath he perfected for evermore, them who are being made holy.

15. But even the Holy Spirit beareth us witness; for, after having said

16. This is the covenant which I will covenant unto them after these days, saith the Lord,Giving my laws upon their hearts, upon their understandings also, will I inscribe them,

17. of their sins, and of their lawlessnesses, I will in nowise be mindful any more.

18. But, wherever a remission of these is, there is, no further, offering, for sins.

19. Having therefore, brethren, freedom of speech for the entrance through the Holy place, by the blood of Jesus,

20. Which entrance he hath consecrated for us, as a way recent and living, through the veil, that is, his flesh,

21. And having a great priest over the house of God,

22. Let us approach with a genuine heart, in full assurance of faith, having been sprinkled, as to our hearts, from an evil conscience, and bathed, as to our bodies, with pure water;

23. Let us hold fast the confession of the hope without wavering,for, faithful, is he that hath promised;

24. And let us attentively consider one another, to provoke unto love and noble works,

25. Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, according to the custom of some, but exhorting, and by so much the more as this, by as much as ye behold, the day, drawing near.

26. For, if, by choice, we be sinning, after the receiving of the full-knowledge of the truth, no longer, for sins, is there left over, a sacrifice,

27. But some fearful reception of judgment and fiery jealousy, about to devour the opposers.

28. Any one having set aside a law of Moses, apart from compassions, upon   two or three witnesses, dieth:

29. Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be accounted worthy, who hath trampled underfoot the Son of God, and, the blood of the covenant, hath esteemed, a profane thing, by which he had been made holy, and, unto the Spirit of favour, hath offered wanton insult?

30. For we know him that hath saidTo me, belongeth avenging, I, will recompense; and againThe Lord will judge his people.

31. A fearful thing   to fall into the hands of a Living God!

32. But be calling to mind the former days, in which, once ye were illuminated, a great combat of sufferings, ye endured;

33. Partly, indeed, because, both with reproaches and tribulations, ye were being made a spectacle, but, partly, because, into fellowship with them who were so involved, ye were brought;

34. For, even with them who were in bonds, ye sympathised, and, unto the seizure of your goods, with joy, ye bade welcome,knowing that ye have yourselves, for a better possession and an abiding.

35. Do not, then, cast away your freedom of speech,the which hath a great recompense.

36. For, of endurance, ye have need, in order that, the will of God having done, Ye may bear away, the promise.

37. For, yet a little while, how short! how short! The Coming One will be here, and will not tarry;

38. But, my righteous one, by faith, shall live, and, if he draw back, my soul delighteth not in him.

39. We, however, are not of a drawing back unto destruction, but, of faith, unto an acquisition of life.

## Hebrews 11

1. But faith is, of things hoped for, a confidence, of facts, a conviction, when they are not seen;

2. For, thereby, well-attested were the ancients.

3. By faith, we understand the ages to have been fitted together, by declaration of God,to the end that, not out of things appearing, should that which is seen, have come into existence.

4. By faith, a fuller sacrifice, did Abel, offer unto God, than Cain,through which, he received witness that he was righteous, there being a witnessing upon his gifts, by God; and, through it, though he died, he yet is speaking.

5. By faith, Enoch was translated, so as not to see death, and was not found, because that, God, had translated him; for, before the translation, he had received witness that he had become well-pleasing unto God;

6. But, apart from faith, it is impossible to be well-pleasing; for he that approacheth unto Godmust needs have faith, that he is, and that, to them who seek him out, a rewarder he becometh.

7. By faith, Noah, having received intimation concerning the things not yet seen, filled with reverence, prepared an ark to the saving of his housethrough which he condemned the world, and, of the righteousness by way of faith, became heir.

8. By faith, being called, Abraham obeyedto come forth into a place he was destined to receive for an inheritance; and he came forth, not well knowing whither he was coming.

9. By faith, he sojourned in the land of promise, as a foreign land, in tents, dwelling, along with Isaac and Jacob, the joint-heirs of the same promise;

10. For he was awaiting the city having foundations, whose architect and builder is, God.

11. By faith, even Sarah herself, received power for founding a seed, even beyond the season of lifes prime,seeing that, faithful, she reckoned, him that had promised;

12. Wherefore, even from one, were born, and, as to these things, one who had become dead,like the stars of the heaven, for multitude, and as the sand that is by the lip of the sea, that cannot be numbered.

13. In faith, all these diednot bearing away the promises, but, from afar, beholding and saluting them, and confessing that, strangers and sojourners, were they upon the land.

14. For, they who such things as these are saying, make it clear that, of a paternal home they are in quest;

15. And, if indeed of that they had been mindful, from which they had come out, they might, in that case, have had an opportunity, to return;

16. But, now, after a better one, are they reaching, that is, a heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be invoked as, their God,for he hath prepared for them, a city.

17. By faith, Abraham, when tested, offered up Isaac, and, the only-begotten, would he have offered up, who the promises had accepted,

18. Even him of whom it had been saidIn Isaac, shall there be called to thee, a seed:

19. Accounting that, even from among the dead, God, was able, to raise   ,whence, even in similitude, he bare him away.

20. By faith, even concerning things to come, did Isaac bless Jacob and Esau.

21. By faith, Jacob, when about to die, blessed each of the sons of Joseph; and bowed in worship on the top of his staff.

22. By faith, Joseph, when drawing to his endconcerning the exodus of the sons of Israel, called to remembrance, and, concerning his bones, gave commandment.

23. By faith, Moses, when bornwas hid three months by his parents, because, they saw, that, goodly, was, the child, and were not affrighted, at the decree of the king.

24. By faith, Moses, when grown uprefused to be called the son of a daughter of a Pharaoh,

25. Rather choosingto be jointly suffering ill-treatment with the people of God, than, for a season, to be having, sins enjoyment;

26. Accountingas greater riches than Egypts treasures, the reproach of the Anointed One; for he was looking away unto the recompense.

27. By faith, he forsook Egyptnot put in fear of the wrath of the king; for, as seeing him who cannot be seen, he persevered.

28. By faith, he hath kept the passover and the besmearing of the blood, lest, he that was destroying the first-born, should be touching them.

29. By faith, they passed through the Red Sea, as over dry land,which the Egyptians, seizing an attempt to do, were swallowed up.

30. By faith, the walls of Jericho, fell, having been surrounded for seven days.

31. By faith, Rahab the harlot perished not with them who refused to yield, she having welcomed the spies with peace.

32. And what more can I say? For, time, will fail me while I go on tellingconcerning Gideon, Barak, Sampson, Jephthah, David also, and Samuel, and the prophets,

33. Who, through faithprevailed in contest over kingdoms, wrought righteousness, attained unto promises, shut the mouths of lions,

34. Quenched the power of fire, escaped the mouths of the sword, were made powerful from weakness, became mighty in battle, overturned, camps of aliens;

35. Women received, by resurrection, their dead; but, others, were put to the rack, not accepting redemption, that, unto a better resurrection, they might attain:

36. Others, again, of mockings and scourgings, received trial, nay! further, of bonds and imprisonments:

37. They were stoned, were pierced through, were sawn asunder, by murder, with a sword, died, went about in sheep-skins, in goat-hides,being in want, suffering tribulation, enduring ill-treatment:

38. Of whom the world, was not worthyupon deserts, wandering, and mountains, and in caves,and in the caverns of the earth.

39. And, these all, though they obtained witness through their faith, yet bare not away, the promise:

40. God, for us, something better providing,that, not apart from us, should they be made, perfect.

## Hebrews 12

1. Therefore, indeed, seeing that, we also, have encircling us, so great a cloud of witnesses, stripping off every incumbrance and the easily entangling sin, with endurance, let us be running, the race that is lying before us,

2. Looking away unto our faiths Princely-leader and perfecter, Jesus,who, in consideration of the joy lying before him, endured a cross, shame, despising! And, on the right hand of the throne of God, hath taken his seat.

3. For take ye into considerationhim who hath endured, such contradiction, by sinners against themselves, lest ye be wearied, in your souls becoming exhausted.

4. Not yet unto blood, have ye resisted, against sin, waging a contest;

5. And ye have quite forgotten the exhortation which, indeed, with you as with sons, doth reason:My son! be not slighting the discipline of the Lord, neither be fainting, when by him, thou art reproved;

6. For, whom the Lord loveth, he doth, discipline, and scourgeth every son whom he doth welcome home.

7. For the sake of discipline, persevere! As towards sons, God, beareth himself, towards you; for who is a son whom a father doth not discipline?

8. If however ye are without discipline, whereof, all, have received a share, then, are ye, bastards, and, not sons.

9. Furthermore, indeed, the fathers of our flesh, we used to have, as administrators of discipline, and we used to pay deference: shall we not, much rather, submit ourselves to the Father of our spirits and, live?

10. For, they, indeed, for a few days, according to that which seemed good to them, were administering discipline; but, he, unto that which is profitable, with view to our partaking of his holiness:

11. But, no discipline, for the present, indeed, seemeth to be of joy, but of sorrow: afterwards, howeverto them who thereby have been trained, it yieldeth peaceful fruit, of righteousness.

12. Wherefore, the slackened hands and paralysed knees, restore ye,

13. And, straight tracks, be making for your feetthat the lame member may not be dislocated, but, be healed rather.

14. Peace, be pursuing, with all, and the obtaining of holiness,without which no one shall see the Lord:

15. Using oversightlest any one be falling behind from the favour of God,lest any root of bitterness, springing up above, be causing trouble, and, through it, the many, be defiled:

16. Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, like Esau,who, for the sake of one meal, yielded up his own firstborn rights;

17. For ye know that, afterwardswhen he even wished to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for, place of repentance, found he none, even though, with tears, he diligently sought it.

18. For ye have not approachedunto, a searching and scorching fire, and gloom, and mist, and tempest,

19. And a trumpets peal,and a sound of things spoken:from which they who heard excused themselves, lest there should be added to them, a word;

20. For they could not bear, that which was being enjoined,and, should a beast be touching the mountain, it shall be stoned;

21. And, so fearful was that which was showing itself, Moses, saidI am terrified, and do tremble l

22. But ye have approachedunto Zions mountain, and unto the city of a Living God, a heavenly Jerusalem,and unto myriads of messengers,

23. in high festival,and unto an assembly of firstborn ones, enrolled in the heavens,and unto God, judge of all,and unto the spirits of righteous ones made perfect,

24. And unto the mediator of a new covenant, Jesus,and unto the blood of sprinkling, more excellently speaking, than, Abel.

25. Beware, lest ye excuse yourselves from him that speaketh; for, if, they escaped not, who excused themselves from him who on earth was warning, how much less, shall, we, who from him that warneth from the heavens, do turn ourselves away:

26. Whose voice shook the earth, then, but, now, hath he promised, sayingYet once for all, I, will shakenot only the earth, but, also the heaven.

27. But, the saying, Yet once for all, maketh clear the removal of the things which can be shaken, as of things done with,that they may remain, which cannot be shaken.

28. Wherefore, seeing that, of a kingdom not to be shaken, we are receiving possession, let us have gratitudewhereby we may be rendering divine service well-pleasingly unto God, with reverence and awe;

29. For, even our God, is a consuming fire.

## Hebrews 13

1. Let brotherly love continue.

2. Of the entertaining of strangers, be not forgetful, for, hereby, unawares, have some entertained, messengers.

3. Bear in mind them who are in bonds, as having become jointly bound,them who are suffering ill-treatment, as being yourselves also in the body.

4. Let marriage be honourable in all, and the bed undefiled, for, fornicators and adulterers, God, will judge.

5. Without fondness for money, be your way of life,being content with the present things,for, he, hath said: In nowise, thee, will I leave, no indeed! in nowise, thee, will I forsake:

6. So that, taking courage, we may be sayingThe Lord, hasteth to my cry,I will not be put in fear: what shall, man, do unto me?

7. Be mindful of them who are guiding you, who, indeed, have spoken unto you, the word of God: the outgoing of whose behaviour, reviewing, be imitating, their faith.

8. Jesus Christ, yesterday, and to-day, is the same,and unto the ages.

9. With teachings, manifold and strange, be not carried aside; for it is, noble, that, with gratitude, should, the heart, be getting confirmed,not with matters of food, in which, they who are walking, have not been profited.

10. We have an altarto eat out of which, they, have no right, who in the tent are doing divine service;

11. For, in the case of those living creatures, whose blood for sins is carried into the holy place, through means of the high-priest, the bodies of these, are burned up, outside the camp.

12. Wherefore, Jesus also, that he might hallow the people through means of his own blood, outside the gate, suffered:

13. Now, therefore, let us be going forth unto him, outside the camp, his reproach bearing.

14. For we have not here an abiding city, but, unto that which is to be, are we seeking our way.

15. Through him, let us be offering up a sacrifice of praise, continually, unto God; that is, a fruit of lips confessing unto his name.

16. But, of the doing good and of fellowship, be not forgetful; for, with such sacrifices as these, is, God, well-pleased.

17. Be yielding unto them who are guiding you, and submit yourselves; for they are watching over your souls, as having an account to render, that, with joy the same they may be doing, and not with sighing,for, unprofitable unto you, were, this.

18. Be praying for us; for we persuade ourselves that an honourable conscience have we, in all things honourably, desiring to behave ourselves.

19. But, much more abundantly, do I exhort you the same to do, that, more speedily, I may be restored, unto you.

20. But, the God of peace, He that led up from among the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep, with the blood of an age-abiding covenant,our Lord Jesus,

21. Fit you, by every good work, for the doing of his will, doing within us, that which is well-pleasing, before him through Jesus Christ: to whom be the glory, unto the ages of ages. Amen.

22. Now I exhort you, brethren, bear with the word of exhortation,for, even with brief   , have I sent unto you.

23. Know ye that our brother Timothy hath been set at liberty,with whom, if more speedily he be coming, I will see you.

24. Salute all them who are guiding you, and all the saints: they from Italy, salute you.

25. Favour be with you all.
