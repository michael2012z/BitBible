# 1 Samuel

## 1 Samuel 1

__And she saidAbide, my daughter, until that thou get to know, how the matter will fall out,for the man will not rest, except he have finished the thing to-day.__

1. And there was a certain man, of Ramathaim-zuphi, of the hill country of Ephraim,whose name, was Elkanah, son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephraimite;

2. and, he, had two wives, the name of the one, Hannah, and, the name of the other, Peninnah,and Peninnah had children, but, Hannah, had no children.

3. So then that man went up, out of his city, from time to time, to worship and to sacrifice unto Yahweh of hosts, in Shiloh,and, there, were the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests unto Yahweh.

4. And, when the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he used to give, to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions;

5. and, unto Hannah, used he to give one portion,howbeit, Hannah, he loved, although, Yahweh, had restrained her from having children.

6. And her rival used even to cause her great vexation, for the sake of provoking her,because Yahweh had restrained her from having children.

7. And, thus, used she to do, year by year, whenever she went up to the house of Yahweh, thus, used she to vex her,and she wept, and would not eat.

8. So Elkanah her husband said to herHannah! wherefore shouldst thou weep? and wherefore wilt thou not eat? and wherefore should thy heart be sad? Am, I, not better to thee, than ten sons?

9. And Hannah rose up, after she had eaten in Shiloh, and after she had drunk,and, Eli the priest, was sitting upon his chair, by the door-post of the temple of Yahweh;

10. and, she being in bitterness of soul, prayed unto Yahweh, and, wept sore.

11. And she vowed a vow, and saidYahweh of hosts! If thou wilt, look, upon the humiliation of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man-child, then will I give him unto Yahweh, all the days of his life, and no, razor, shall come upon his head.

12. And so it was, as she continued praying before Yahweh, that Eli was watching her mouth.

13. But as for, Hannah, she, was speaking in her heart, only her lips, were moving, but, her voice, could not be heard,so Eli thought she had been drunken.

14. And Eli said unto her, How long, wilt thou be, drunken? Put away thy wine from thee.

15. And Hannah responded and saidNay! my lord; A woman depressed in spirit, am I: neither wine nor strong drink, have I drunk,but I poured out my soul, before Yahweh.

16. Do not count thy handmaid for an abandoned woman,for, out of the abundance of my grief and my vexation, have I spoken, hitherto.

17. Then responded Eli, and saidGo and prosper! And the, God of Israel, grant thy petition which thou hast asked of him!

18. And she said: Let thy serving-woman find favour, in thine eyes. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and, her countenance, was sad no longer.

19. And they rose up early in the morning, and worshipped before Yahweh, and returned, and entered their own house, in Ramah,and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and Yahweh remembered her.

20. And so it was, when the days had come round during which Hannah was with child, that she bare a son,and called his name Samuel, Because, of Yahweh, I asked him. \fs15

21. And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up, to offer unto Yahweh the yearly sacrifice, and   his own vow.

22. But, Hannah, went not up,for she said to her husband  till the boy is weaned, then will I take him, and he shall appear before Yahweh, and abide there evermore.

23. And Elkanah her husband said to herDo what is good in thine own eyes, tarry until thou have weaned him, only may Yahweh establish his word! So the woman tarried, and nursed her son, until she weaned him.

24. Then took she him up with her, when she had weaned him, with a bullock of three years old, and one ephah of meal, and a skin of wine, and took him to the house of Yahweh, at Shiloh,the boy yet being young.

25. So they slew the bullock,and took the boy in, unto Eli.

26. And she saidPardon, my lord! By the life of thy soul, my lord,I, am the woman who was standing near thee here, praying unto Yahweh:

27. For this boy, I prayed,And Yahweh hath given me my petition which I asked of him.

28. Hence, I also, have loaned him unto Yahweh, all the days that he liveth. He, is lent unto Yahweh. And he bowed down there, unto Yahweh.

## 1 Samuel 2

1. Then prayed Hannah, and said, My heart hath leaped for joy in Yahweh, My horn is exalted in Yahweh, My mouth is opened wide, oer my foes, Because I rejoice in thy salvation.

2. There is none holy like Yahweh, Nay! there, is none, except Thee, Nor, is, there a rock, like our God.

3. Do not multiply words, so loftilyloftily, Nor let arrogance proceed from your mouth,For, a GOD of knowledge, is Yahweh, And, for himself, are great doings made firm.

4. The bow of the mighty, is dismayed,While, the fainting, are girded with strength;

5. The sated, have, for bread, taken hire, But, the famished, have left off their toil,So that, the barren, hath given birth unto seven, While, she that hath many sons, languisheth:

6. Yahweh, doth kill, and make alive,Taketh down to hades, and bringeth up:

7. Yahweh, maketh poor, and enricheth,Layeth low, yea exalteth;

8. Raiseth, from the dust, the poor, From the dunghill, uplifteth the needy, To give them a dwelling with nobles, And, a throne of glory, to make them inherit. For, to Yahweh, belong the pillars of the earth, And he setteth thereon the habitable world.

9. The feet of his loving ones, he doth guard, But, the lawless, in darkness shall be silent,For, by strength, shall no man prevail.

10. As for Yahweh,they shall be shattered who contend with him, Over him, in the heavens will he thunder, Yahweh, will judge the ends of the earth,That he may give strength to his King, And exalt the horn of his Anointed One.

11. Then went Elkanah to Ramah, unto his own house,but, the boy, remained ministering unto Yahweh, before Eli the priest.

12. Now, the sons of Eli, were abandoned men,they knew not Yahweh.

13. And, the custom of the priests with the people, waswhen any man offered a sacrifice, then would come the priests young man, as the flesh was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand;

14. and would strike it into the boiler, or into the trough, or into the kettle, or into the pot, all that the fork would bring up, the priest took for himself. Thus and thus, used they to do unto all Israel, who came thither, in Shiloh.

15. Also, before any could make perfume with the fat, the priests young man would come in and say to the person who was sacrificing, Come! give flesh for the priests roastings,for he will not take of thee boiled fleshonly raw.

16. And, if the man said to him, Let them at least, make incense, at once with the fat, then take thou as much as thy soul craveth, Then said he to him, But, at once, shalt thou give it; or else, I will take it by force.

17. And so it was, that, the sin of the young men, was exceeding great, before Yahweh,for men scorned the offerings of Yahweh.

18. But, as for Samuel, he was ministering before Yahweh,a boy girded with an ephod of linen.

19. Also, a little robe, used his mother to make for him, and bring it up to him, from year to year,when she came up with her husband, to offer the sacrifice of the year.

20. And Eli used to bless Elkanah and his wife, and to sayYahweh give thee seed of this woman, instead of the loan that hath been lent unto Yahweh. So they went their way to his own place.

21. And Yahweh visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bare three sons, and two daughters. Thus did the boy Samuel grow up with Yahweh.

22. Now, Eli, was very old,but he used to hear all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how they even lay with the women who did service, at the opening of the tent of meeting.

23. So he said to them, Wherefore should ye do such things as these? for I keep hearing of your wicked doings, from all these people.

24. Nay, my sons! for it is no good report that I do hear: leading into transgression the people of Yahweh.

25. If one man sin against another, God will interpose, but, if, against Yahweh, a man sin, who will intercede, for him? But they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, for Yahweh was pleased to put them to death.

26. But, the boy Samuel, went on growing in stature, and in favour,both with Yahweh, and also with men.

27. And there came a man of God, unto Eli,and said unto himThus, saith Yahweh, I, did indeed reveal myself, unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt, as servants unto the house of Pharaoh;

28. choosing him out of all the tribes of Israel unto myself, to minister as priest, to offer upon mine altar, to perfume with incense to bear an ephod before me,Therefore gave I unto the house of thy father all the altar-flames of the sons of Israel.

29. Wherefore have ye been kicking at my sacrifices, and my presents, which I commanded, to serve for a home,and shouldest have honoured thy sons more than me: fattening yourselves, with the first of every present of Israel, before me?

30. Hence, the oracle of Yahweh God of Israel, I, said, that, thy house, and the house of thy father, should go to and fro in my presence, unto times age-abiding: But, now, (is the oracle of Yahweh)Be it far from me! For, them who honour me, will I honour, but, they who despise me, shall be lightly esteemed.

31. Lo! days are coming, when I will hew off thine arm, and the arm of the house of thy father,that there shall be no elder in thy house;

32. But thou shalt descry distress at home, in all that shall gladden Israel,and there shall not be an elder in thine own house, all the days.

33. But, any man of thine whom I may not cut off from mine altar, it shall beto consume his eyes, and grieve his soul; Howbeit, all the multitude of thy house, shall die, by the sword of men.

34. And, this, for thee is the sign, which shall come upon thy two sons, upon Hophni and Phinehas,In one day, shall they, both of them, die;

35. And I will raise me up a faithful priest, According to that which is in my heart and in my soul, will he do; Therefore will I build for him an assured house, and he shall go to and fro in presence of mine Anointed, all the days.

36. And it shall be, that, any that is left in thy house, shall come bowing down to him for a small coin of silver, and for a cake of bread, and shall say: Appoint me, I pray thee, to one of the priestly offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.

## 1 Samuel 3

1. Now, the boy Samuel, was ministering unto Yahweh, before Eli,and, the word of Yahweh, had become rare in those days, there was no well-known vision.

2. But it came to pass, at that time, when Eli was lying down in his place, his eyes, having begun to be dim, he could not see,

3. though, the lamp of God, was not yet to be put out, and, Samuel, was lying down in the temple of Yahweh, where was the ark of God,

4. that Yahweh called unto Samuel, and he saidBehold me!

5. So he ran unto Eli and saidBehold me! for thou calledst me. And he saidI called not, returnIts down. So he went, and lie down.

6. And again Yahweh called once thereSamuel! Then rose Samuel, and went unto Eli, and saidBehold me! for thou calledst me. And he saidI called not, my son, returnlie down.

7. Now, Samuel, as yet knew not Yahweh,nor, as yet, had been revealed unto him, the word of Yahweh.

8. And again Yahweh calledSamuel! a third time. Then he arose, and went unto Eli, and saidBehold me! for thou calledst me. Then did Eli perceive, that, Yahweh, was calling the boy.

9. So Eli said to SamuelGo, lie down, and it shall be, if he call unto thee, that thou shalt saySpeak, Yahweh, for thy servant is listening. And Samuel went, and lay down in his place.

10. Then came Yahweh, and stood, and called as time after timeSamuel! Samuel! And Samuel said, Speak, for thy servant is listening.

11. And Yahweh said unto Samuel, Lo! I am doing a thing, in Israel,at which both ears of everyone that heareth it shall tingle.

12. In that day, will I confirm against Eli, all that I have spoken against his house,beginning and finishing.

13. Therefore do I tell him, that I am about to judge his house unto times age-abiding, for the iniquity which he knoweth, in that his sons are cursing God, and he hath not rebuked them.

14. And therefore have I sworn, respecting the house of Eli,that the iniquity of the house of Eli shall receive no propitiatory-covering, by sacrifice or by present, unto times age-abiding.

15. And Samuel lay until the morning, and rose early in the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Yahweh,but, Samuel, feared to tell the appearing, unto Eli.

16. So Eli called Samuel, and saidSamuel! my son. And he saidBehold me!

17. And he saidWhat is the word, which he spake unto thee? I pray thee, do not hide it from me. So, let God do to thee, and, so, let him add, if thou hide from me a word, out of anything which he hath spoken unto thee.

18. So Samuel told him all the words, and hid nothing from him. And he said, Yahweh, he is; what is good in his own eyes, let him do.

19. And Samuel grew,and, Yahweh, proved to he with him, and let none of all his words fall to the ground.

20. So all Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, came to know,that Samuel had become confirmed as a prophet unto Yahweh.

21. Thus did Yahweh again appear in Shiloh,for Yahweh had revealed himself unto Samuel in Shiloh, in the word of Yahweh.

## 1 Samuel 4

1. And so it was, when the word of Samuel had reached all Israel, that Israel went forth to meet the Philistines in battle, and they encamped near Eben-ezer, while, the Philistines, encamped in Aphek.

2. And the Philistines set themselves in array to meet Israel, and, when the battle spread, then was Israel smitten before the Philistines,and there were slain of the army in the field about four thousand men.

3. And, when the people came into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath Yahweh smitten us to-day, before the Philistines? Let us fetch unto us, out of Shiloh, the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, that, when it cometh into our midst, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.

4. So the people sent to Shiloh, and bare from thence the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of hosts, who inhabiteth the cherubim,and, there, were the two sons of Eli, with the ark of the covenant of God, namely, Hophni and Phinehas.

5. And so it was, when the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came into the camp, that all Israel brake out into a loud shout of joy,so that the earth rang again.

6. And, when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they saidWhat meaneth the noise of this loud shout of joy in the camp of the Hebrews? And they learned that, the ark of Yahweh, had come into the camp.

7. And the Philistines were afraid, for they saidGod hath come into the camp. And they saidWoe to us! for there hath not happened the like of this, heretofore.

8. Woe to us! Who shall rescue us out of the hand of these majestic gods? These, are the gods, who smote the Egyptians with all manner of smiting in the desert!

9. Take courage, and quit yourselves like men, ye Philistines, lest ye come into bondage to the Hebrews, as they have been in bondage unto you,therefore must ye quit yourselves like men, and fight.

10. So the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his home; and the slaughter became exceeding great,and there fell of Israelthirty thousand footmen.

11. And, the ark of God, was taken,and, the two sons of Eli, were slain, Hophni and Phinehas.

12. And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and entered Shiloh on the same day,with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.

13. And, when he entered, lo! Eli was sitting upon his chair, by the wayside, watching, for his heart was trembling for the ark of God,and, the man, entered to tell the news in the city, and all the city made outcry.

14. And, when Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he saidWhat meaneth the noise of this tumult? And, the man, hasted, and came, and told Eli.

15. Now, Eli, was ninety-eight years old; and his eyes were fixed, that he could not see.

16. So the man said unto Eli, I, am he that came in from the army, yea, I, from the army, fled to-day. And he saidWhat is the thing that hath happened, my son?

17. And the bearer of tidings answered, and saidIsrael hath fled before the Philistines, Moreover also, a great smiting, hath taken place among the people,Moreover also, thy two sons, are slain, Hophni and Phinehas, And, the ark of God, is taken.

18. And it came to pass, when he mentioned the ark of God, that he fell from off his seat backwards, at the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died, for, old, was the man, and, heavy,and, he had judged Israel forty years.

19. Now, his daughter-in-law, wife of Phinehas, was with child, ready to give birth, and, when she heard the tidings, as to the taking of the ark of God, and the death of her father-in-law, and her husband, she bowed herself and gave birth, for her pains had seized her.

20. And, about the time of her death, the women that stood by her said: Do not fear, for, to a son, hast thou given birth. But she neither answered nor regarded.

21. And she called the boy I-chabod! saying, Exiled is the glory from Israel,In regard to the taking of the ark of God, and to her father-in-law, and to her husband. \fs15

22. So she saidExiled is the glory from Israel,For the ark of God hath been taken.

## 1 Samuel 5

1. Now, the Philistines, having taken the ark of God,brought it in from Eben-ezer, unto Ashdod.

2. And, when the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon,and placed it by the side of Dagon.

3. And, when they of Ashdod rose early on the morrow and entered into the house of Dagon, they looked and lo! Dagon, was lying prostrate on his face to the earth, before the ark of Yahweh,so they took Dagon and restored him to his place.

4. And, when they rose up early in the morning of the morrow, lo! Dagon, was lying prostrate on his face to the earth, before the ark of Yahwehand, the head of Dagon, and both the palms of his hands, had been cut off against the threshold, only, Dagon himself, was left to him.

5. For this cause, do not the priests of Dagon, nor any that enter into the house of Dagon, tread upon the threshold of Dagon, in Ashdod,until this day.

6. Then was the hand of Yahweh heavy against them of Ashdod, and he astounded them,and smote with tumours Ashdod and her bounds.

7. And, when the men of Ashdod saw that, so, it was, then kept they saying, Let not the ark of the God of Israel abide with us, for, hard, is his hand upon us, and upon Dagon our god.

8. So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and saidWhat shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they said: To Gath, let the ark of the God of Israel go round. So they took round the ark of the God of Israel.

9. And so it was, after they had taken it round, then was the hand of Yahweh against the city, with an exceeding great consternation, and he smote the men of the city, from the least, even unto the greatest,and they brake out with tumours.

10. Then sent they the ark of God to Ekron,and so it was, when the ark of God entered Ekron, that the Ekronites made outcry, sayingThey have brought round unto me the ark of the God of Israel, to slay me, and my people!

11. So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and saidSend away the ark of the God of Israel, and restore it to its own place, that it slay not me, and my people. For there had come a deadly consternation, throughout all the city, heavy exceedingly, was the hand of God there.

12. And, the men who died not, were smitten with the tumours,so the cry of the city for help, ascended the heavens.

## 1 Samuel 6

1. And it came to pass, that the ark of Yahweh was in the country of the Philistines, seven months.

2. Then called the Philistines for the priests and for the diviners, saying, What shall we do with the ark of Yahweh? Let us know, wherewith we shall send it to its own place.

3. And they saidIf ye are going to send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it away, empty, but ye must, surely return, to him, a guilt-offering,then, shall ye be healed, and it shall be known to you, wherefore his hand would not turn away from you.

4. And they saidWhat shall be the guilt-offering, that we shall return to him? And they saidBy the number of the lords of the Philistines, five tumours of gold, and five mice of gold,for, one plague, was on you all, and on your lords.

5. Wherefore ye shall make likenesses of your turnouts, and likenesses of your mice that are laying waste the land, and shall, give unto the, God of Israel, glory,Peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your god, and from off your land.

6. Wherefore, then, should ye make your heart dull, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh made their heart dull! When he had done his great doings upon them, did they not let them go, and they departed?

7. Now, therefore, take and get ready, one new waggon, and two milch kine, whereon hath never come yoke,then shall ye fasten the kine in the waggon, and withdraw their calves from them, into the shed;

8. and ye shall take the ark of Yahweh, and place it in the waggon, also, the jewels of gold which ye send back to him as a guilt-offering, shall ye put into a coffer, at the side thereof,so shall ye let it go, and it shall depart.

9. Then shall ye lookif, by the way of its own boundary, it goeth up to Beth-shemesh, he, it was who caused us this great affliction,but, if not, then shall we know that it was not, his hand, that smote us, a chance, it was, that befell us.

10. The men, therefore, did so, and took two milch kine, and fastened them in the waggon,but, their calves, shut they up in the shed.

11. And they put the ark of Yahweh, into the waggon,also the coffer, with the mice of gold, and the likenesses of their tumours.

12. And the kine went straight along the road, on the way to Beth-shemesh, yea, along the main highway, they went, lowing as they went, turning not aside, to the right hand or to the left. And, the lords of the Philistines, went along after them, as far as the bounds of Beth-shemesh.

13. Now, they of Beth-shemesh, were reaping their wheat-harvest in the vale,so they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to meet it.

14. And, the waggon, entered into the field of Joshua, a man of Beth-shemesh, and stood still, there, where also, was a great stone,so they clave into pieces the planks of the waggon, and, the kine, offered they up as an ascending-sacrifice, unto Yahweh.

15. And, the Levites, took down the ark of Yahweh, and the coffer that was with it, wherein were the jewels of gold, and put them upon the great stone,and, the men of Beth-shemesh, caused to go up ascending-offerings and offered sacrifices, that day, unto Yahweh.

16. And, the five lords of the Philistines, saw it,and returned unto Ekron, the same day.

17. Now, these, are the golden boils which, the Philistines returned as a guilt-offering unto Yahweh,For Ashdod, one, for Gaza, one, for Ashkelon, one, for Gath, one, for Ekron, one;

18. And the golden mice, by the number of all the cities of the Philistines, pertaining to the five lords, both fortified cities, and country villages,yea, even the great meadow whereon they rested the ark of Yahweh, until this day, is in the field-land of Joshua, the man of Beth-shemesh.

19. And, when he smote the men of Beth-shemesh, because they looked into the ark of Yahweh, yea smote of the people seventy men   fifty thousand men, the people mourned, for that Yahweh had smitten the people with a great smiting.

20. Then said the men of Beth-shemesh, Who is able to stand before Yahweh, this holy God? and, unto whom, shall he go up from us?

21. And they sent messengers unto the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying,The Philistines have returned the ark of Yahweh, come down, fetch it up unto you.

## 1 Samuel 7

1. Then came the men of Kiriath-jearim and fetched up the ark of Yahweh, and brought it into the house of Abinadab, in the hill,and, Eleazar his son, hallowed they, to guard the ark of Yahweh.

2. And so it was, that, from the day the ark came to dwell in Kiriath-jearim, the days multiplied, and became twenty years,and all the house of Israel went mourning after Yahweh.

3. And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If, with all your heart, ye are returning unto Yahweh, then put away the gods of the foreigner out of your midst, and the Ashtorethsand firmly set your heart towards Yahweh, and serve him, alone, that he may deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.

4. So the sons of Israel put away the Baals, and the Ashtoreths,and served Yahweh, alone.

5. And Samuel said, Gather all Israel unto Mizpah,that I may pray for you, unto Yahweh.

6. So they gathered themselves unto Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before Yahweh, and fasted on that day, and said, there, We have sinned against Yahweh. And Samuel judged the sons of Israel in Mizpah.

7. And, when the Philistines heard that the sons of Israel had gathered themselves together unto Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel,and, when the sons of Israel heard it, they shrank with fear, from the face of the Philistines.

8. And the sons of Israel said unto Samuel, Do not turn in silence from us, from making outcry unto Yahweh our God,that he would save us out of the hand of the Philistines.

9. So Samuel took one sucking lamb, and offered it up, as an entire ascending-sacrifice unto Yahweh,and Samuel made outcry unto Yahweh, for Israel, and Yahweh answered him.

10. And, when Samuel was offering up the ascending-sacrifice, the Philistines, drew near to fight against Israel,but Yahweh thundered with a great noise throughout that day, over the Philistines, and confused them, and they were smitten before Israel.

11. And the men of Israel went forth out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines,and smote them as far as under Beth-car.

12. And Samuel took a certain stone, and set it between Mizpah and Yeshanah, and called the name thereof Eben-ezer,and said, Hitherto, hath Yahweh helped us.

13. So the Philistines were subdued, and, no more, came within the boundary of Israel,and the hand of Yahweh was against the Philistines, all the days of Samuel.

14. And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even as far as Gath; even the boundaries thereof, did Israel rescue out of the hand of the Philistines,thus came there to be peace between Israel and the Amorites.

15. And Samuel judged Israel, all the days of his life.

16. And he used to take his journey, from year to year, and go round to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpah,and used to judge Israel, at all these places.

17. And, his returning, was to Ramah, for, there, was his house, and, there, judged he Israel,so he built there an altar unto Yahweh.

## 1 Samuel 8

1. And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he appointed his sons judges to Israel;

2. and the name of his firstborn son was, Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah,they were judges in Beer-sheba.

3. Howbeit his sons walked not in his ways, but stooped to extortion,and took bribes, and perverted judgment.

4. So then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together,and came unto Samuel, to Ramah;

5. and said unto himLo! thou, art old, and, thy sons, walk not in thy ways: Now, appoint for us a king to judge us, like all the nations.

6. But the thing was displeasing in the eyes of Samuel, when they said, Give unto us a king to judge us. So Samuel prayed unto Yahweh.

7. And Yahweh said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people, in all that they shall say unto thee,for, not thee, have they rejected, but, me, have they rejected, from being king over them.

8. According to all the doings which they have done, from the day I brought them up out of Egypt, even until this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so, are they doing even unto thee.

9. Now, therefore, hearken to their voice,save that thou, enter protest, against them, and tell them the manner of the king who will reign over them.

10. So then Samuel spake all the words of Yahweh unto the people, who were asking of him, a king.

11. And he said, This, will be the manner of the king who will reign over you,Your sons, will he take and appoint for himself, as his charioteers and as his horsemen, and they shall run before his chariots;

12. and he will appoint for himself, princes of thousands, and princes of fifties,and to plough his fields, and to reap his harvest, and to make his weapons of war, and the instruments of his chariots;

13. And, your daughters, will he take,as perfumers and as cooks, and as bakers;

14. And, your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, the best of them, will he take, and give to his servants;

15. And, your seed, and your vineyards, will he tithe, and give to his courtiers and to his servants;

16. And, your men-servants, and your maidservants, and your oxen, even the goodliest, and your asses, will he take,and put them to his work;

17. Your flocks, will he tithe,and, ye yourselves, shall become his servants.

18. Then will ye make outcry, in that day, because of your king whom ye have chosen for yourselves,and Yahweh will not answer you, in that day.

19. But the people refused to hearken unto the voice of Samuel,and they saidNay! but, a king, shall be over us:

20. so shall, even we, become like all the nations,and our king shall judge us, and go forth before us, and fight our battles.

21. And Samuel heard all the words of the people,and spake them in the ears of Yahweh.

22. And Yahweh said unto Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel: Go ye, every man to his own city.

## 1 Samuel 9

1. Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name, was Kishson of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Becorath, son of Aphiah, son of a Benjamite,a mighty man of valour;

2. and, he, had a son, whose name, was Saul, a choice young man and of noble appearance, and there was not a man of the sons of Israel, more noble than he,from his shoulders and upwards, was he taller than any of the people.

3. Now there had gone astray asses belonging to Kish, Sauls father,so Kish said unto Saul his sonI pray thee, take with thee one of the young men, and arisego, seek the asses.

4. And he passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they found them not,then passed they through the land of Shaalim, and they were not there, then passed he through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.

5. They, had come into the land of Zuph when, Saul, said to his young man who was with him, Come! and let us return; lest my father leave off   for the asses, and be concerned for us.

6. And he said to him: Lo! I pray thee, a man of God,   in this city, and, the man, is held in honour, all that he saith, surely cometh to pass. Now, let us go thither; peradventure he may tell us our way, whereon we should have gone.

7. Then said Saul to his young man: Behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man, for, the bread, hath failed from our sacks, and, present, there is none to bring to the man of God,what is there with us?

8. And the young man again answered Saul, and saidLo! there is found in my hand, the fourth part of a shekel of silver,which thou canst give to the man of God, and he will tell us our way.

9. Beforetime, in Israel, thus, said a man when he went to enquire of God, Come and let us go as far as the seer,for, the prophet of to-day, used to be called, beforetime, the seer.

10. And Saul said unto his young man, Good, is thy word, come! let us go! So they went unto the city, where the man of God was.

11. They were going up the ascent of the city, when they found young women, coming out to draw water,so they said unto these, Is, the seer, in this place?

12. And the young women answered them and said: He is, lo! before you now, even as, to-day, hath he entered the city, for the people have a sacrifice, to-day, in the high place.

13. As ye enter the city, so, shall ye surely find him, ere yet he shall go up to the high place to eat, for the people will not eat until he hath come, for, he, doth bless the sacrifice, after that, will they eat who have been bidden. Now, therefore, go up, for, about this very time, shall ye surely find him.

14. So they went up into the city. As they were entering into the midst of the city, lo! Samuel, coming out over against them, to ascend the high place.

15. Now, Yahweh, had unveiled the ear of Samuel,one day before Saul came, saying:

16. About this time to-morrow, will I send unto thee, a man out of the land of Benjamin, whom thou shalt anoint, to be leader over my people Israel, and he shall save my people, out of the hand of the Philistines,for I have looked upon the oppression, because their outcry hath come in unto me.

17. And, when, Samuel, beheld Saul, Yahweh, answered him, Lo! the man, of whom I said unto thee, Here, is one shall control my people.

18. And Saul drew near unto Samuel, in the midst of the gate,and saidI pray thee, do tell me, where is the house of the seer?

19. And Samuel answered Saul, and saidI, am, the seer! Go up before me, to the high place, so shall ye eat with me, to-day,and I will let thee go in the morning, and, all that is in thy heart, will I tell thee.

20. And, as for the asses that went astray from thee three days ago, do not regard them, for they are found,but to whom belongeth all that is desirable in Israel? is it not to thee, and to all the house of thy father?

21. Then answered Saul, and saidAm not I, a man of Benjamin, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and   , my family, the poorest of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Wherefore, then, hast thou spoken unto me of such a thing as this?

22. And Samuel took Saul and his young man, and brought them into the guest-chamber,and gave them a place at the head of them who were bidden, they being about thirty persons.

23. And Samuel said to the cook, Set on the portion that I gave thee,of which I said unto thee, Put it by thee.

24. And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and placed it before Saul, and saidLo! the part reserved! Set it before thee   eat, for, unto the time appointed, hath it been kept for thee, since the time that I said, The people, have I bidden. So Saul did eat with Samuel, on that day.

25. And, when they had come down from the high place into the city, he spread a couch for Saul upon the house-top, and he lay down.

26. And it came to pass, at the uprisings of the dawn, that Samuel called unto Saul on the house-top, saying, Arise! that I may send thee away. So Saul arose, and they two, he and Samuel, went forth abroad.

27. As they were going down the end of the city, Samuel, said unto SaulBid the young man, that he pass on before us, (and he passed on) but, thou, stand still where thou art, that I may let time hear the word of God.

## 1 Samuel 10

1. Then took Samuel a flask of oil, and poured out upon his head, and kissed him,and saidIs it not, that Yahweh hath anointed thee over his inheritance, as leader?

2. When thou departest, to-day, from me, then shalt thou find two men by the grave of Rachel, within the boundary of Benjamin, in Zelzah,and they will say unto thee, The asses are found, which thou wentest to seek, and lo! thy father hath abandoned caring for the asses, and is concerned for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?

3. Then shalt thou pass on quickly from thence onwards, and come as far as the oak of Tabor, and there shall find thee there, three men going up unto God, at Bethel,one, carrying three kids, and, another, carrying three cakes of bread, and, another, carrying a skin of wine;

4. then will they ask thee, of thy welfare,and give thee two cakes of bread, which thou shalt receive at their hand.

5. After that, shalt thou come unto the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines,and it shall be, as thou comest in thither into the city, thou shalt light upon a band of prophets, coming down from the high place, and, before them, a harp, and a timbrel, and a flute, and a lyre, they having been moved to prophesy.

6. Then will come suddenly upon thee, the Spirit of Yahweh, and thou shalt be moved to prophesy with them,and shalt be changed into another man.

7. And it shall be, when these signs shall come unto thee, then act thou for thyself, as thou shalt find occasion, for, God, is with thee.

8. And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal, for lo! I am coming down unto thee, to offer up ascending-offerings, to sacrifice peace-offerings,seven days, shalt thou tarry, until I come unto thee, then will I let thee know what thou shalt do.

9. And so it was, that, when he turned away to depart from Samuel, God gave him another heart,and all these signs came to pass that day.

10. And, when they came thither to the hill, lo! a band of prophets coming to meet him,then came suddenly upon him, the Spirit of God, and he was moved to prophesy in their midst.

11. And it came to pass, that, all who knew him aforetime, looked, and lo! with the prophets, he did prophesy. So the people said, one to anotherWhat, now, hath befallen the son of Kish? Is, even Saul, among the prophets?

12. Then responded one of that place, and said, But who is, their father? For this cause, it became a proverb, Is, even Saul, among the prophets?

13. And, when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.

14. Then said Sauls uncle unto him, and unto his young manWhither have ye been? And he said, To seek the asses, and, when they were nowhere, to be seen, we came unto Samuel.

15. And Sauls uncle said,Do tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said to you.

16. And Saul said unto his uncle, He, told, us that the asses were found,but, as to the matter of the kingdom, he told him not what Samuel had said.

17. Then Samuel called out the people, unto Yahweh, at Mizpah,

18. and said unto the sons of IsraelThus, saith Yahweh, God of Israel: I myself, brought up Israel, out of Egypt,and rescued you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that distressed you.

19. Yet, ye, to-day, have rejected your God, who, himself, hath been giving you salvation from all your calamities and your distresses, and ye have said to him: A king, shalt thou set over us,Now, therefore, present yourselves before Yahweh, by your tribes, and by your thousands.

20. And, when Samuel had brought near all the tribes of Israel, then was taken the tribe of Benjamin.

21. And, when he had brought near the tribe of Benjamin, by their families, then was taken the family of Matri,and, when he had brought near the family of Matri, man by man, then was taken Saul the son of Kish; so they sought him, but he was not to be found.

22. Then asked they again of Yahweh, Hath there yet to come in hither a man? And Yahweh said, Lo! he, hath hid himself among the stores.

23. So they ran, and fetched him thence, and, when he presented himself in the midst of the people, then was he   taller than any of the people, from his shoulders and upwards.

24. And Samuel said unto all the peopleHave ye seen him whom Yahweh hath chosen, that there is none like him, among all the people? And all the people shouted, and saidLet the king live!

25. Then Samuel declared unto the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a scroll, and laid it up before Yahweh. And Samuel sent away all the people, every man to his own house.

26. Yea, even Saul, went to his own house, at Gibeah,and the valiant men whose heart God had moved went with him.

27. But, abandoned men, saidHow can this one save us? So they treated him with contempt, and brought him no present,but he was as one that was deaf.

## 1 Samuel 11

1. Then came up Nahash the Ammonite, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead,and all the man of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Solemnise with us a covenant, that we may serve thee.

2. And Nahash the Ammonite said unto them, Hereby, will I solemnise   with you by digging out for you, every ones right eye,and laying it for a reproach, upon all Israel.

3. And the elders of Jabesh said unto himGive us a respite of seven days, that we may send messengers throughout all the bounds of Israel,and then, if there is none to save us, we will come out unto thee.

4. And, when the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, and spake the words in the ears of the people, all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.

5. But lo! Saul, came in, following the oxen, out of the field, and Saul said, What aileth the people, that they should weep? Then were recounted to him the words of the men of Jabesh.

6. And the Spirit of God came suddenly upon Saul, when he heard these words,and his anger raged furiously.

7. So he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent throughout all the bounds of Israel by the hand of messengerssaying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul, and after Samuel, so, shall it be done unto his oxen. Then felt the dread of Yahweh, upon the people, and they came forth, as one man.

8. And, when he numbered them in Bezek, the sons of Israel were found to bethree hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.

9. So they said unto the messengers who had comeThus, shall ye surely say to the men of Jabesh-gilead, To-morrow, shall ye have deliverance, about the time the son is hot. And, when the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh, they rejoiced.

10. So the men of Jabesh said, To-morrow, will we come out unto you,Then shall ye do with us, according to all that is good in your eyes.

11. And it came to pass on the morrow, that Saul set the people in three companies, and they entered into the midst of the host, during the morning watch, and smote Ammon until the day was hot. And it came to pass that, they who were left, were scattered, so that there were not left among them, two together.

12. Then said the people unto Samuel, Who is he that was saying, Shall, Saul, reign over us? Give up the men, that we may put them to death.

13. But Saul said, There shall not be put to death a man, this day,for, to-day, hath Yahweh wrought deliverance in Israel.

14. Then said Samuel unto the people, Come and let us go to Gilgal,and let us there renew the kingdom.

15. So all the people went to Gilgal, and made Saul king there, before Yahweh, in Gilgal, and offered there sacrifices of peace-offerings before Yahweh,and Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced there, exceedingly.

## 1 Samuel 12

1. And Samuel said unto all Israel, Lo! I have hearkened unto your voice, in all that ye said to me,and have set over you a king.

2. Now, therefore, lo! the king going to and fro before you, But, I, am old and grey-headed, and, my sons, lo! they are with you,But, I, have gone to and fro before you from my youth until this day.

3. Behold me! testify against me, before Yahweh, and before his AnointedWhose, ox, have I taken? or whose, ass, have I taken? or whom have I oppressed? Whom have I crushed? or at whose, hands, have I taken a bribe, to cover up mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it unto you.

4. And they said, Thou hast not oppressed us, neither hast thou crushed us,neither hast thou taken, at the hand of any man, any thing.

5. And he said unto themWitness, is Yahweh against you, and, witness, is his Anointed, this day, that ye have not found in my hand, any thing! And they said: Witness!

6. And Samuel said unto the people: Witness, is Yahweh, who wrought with Moses and with Aaron, and who brought up your fathers out of the land of Egypt.

7. Now, therefore, take your stand and let me plead with you, before Yahweh,and tell you all the righteous acts of Yahweh, which he wrought with you, and with your fathers:

8. How that, when Jacob had come into Egypt,and your fathers had made outcry unto Yahweh, then Yahweh sent Moses and Aaron, and they brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and he caused them to dwell in this place;

9. And, when they forgat Yahweh their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, prince of the host of Jabin, king of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them;

10. But, when they made outcry unto Yahweh and saidWe have sinned, in that we have forsaken Yahweh, and have served the Baals and the Ashtoreths,now, therefore, deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, that we may serve thee,

11. then Yahweh sent Jerubbaal and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel,and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies, on every side, and ye dwelt in safety.

12. But, when ye saw that, Nahash king of the sons of Ammon, came upon you, then said ye unto me, Nay! but, a king, shall reign over us, when, Yahweh your God, was your king!

13. Now, therefore, lo! the king whom ye have chosen, for whom ye have asked,lo! therefore, Yahweh hath set over you a king.

14. If ye will revere Yahweh, and serve him, and hearken unto his voice, and not rebel against the bidding of Yahweh, then shall, both ye and your king that reigneth over you, continue to follow after Yahweh your God.

15. But, if ye hearken not unto the voice of Yahweh, but rebel against the bidding of Yahweh, then will the hand of Yahweh continue to be against you, and against your fathers.

16. Even now, stand still and see this great thing,which Yahweh is about to do before your eyes:

17. Is it not wheat harvest, to-day? I will cry unto Yahweh, that he may give forth thunderings and rain,know ye then and see, that, your wrong, is great which ye have done in the sight of Yahweh, in asking for yourselves, a king.

18. So Samuel cried unto Yahweh, and Yahweh gave forth thunderings and rain, on that day,and all the people greatly feared Yahweh, and Samuel.

19. And all the people said unto SamuelPray for thy servants, unto Yahweh thy God, and let it not be that we die,For we have added, to all our sins, a wrong, in asking for ourselves a king.

20. Then said Samuel unto the peopleDo not fear, ye, have done all this wrong,nevertheless, do not turn aside from following Yahweh, but serve Yahweh, with all your heart;

21. and turn not aside after vanities, that can neither profit nor deliver, because, vanities, they are.

22. For Yahweh will not give up his people, because of his great name, for Yahweh was minded to make you his people.

23. As for me also, far be it from me, that I should sin against Yahweh, by ceasing to pray for you,but I will direct you, in the good and right way.

24. Only, revere Yahweh, and serve him in truth, with all your heart,for see, what great things he hath done with you.

25. But, if ye, will do wrong, both ye and your king shall be swept away.

## 1 Samuel 13

1. Saul was   years old when he began to reign; and, when he had reigned two years over Israel,

2. Saul chose him three thousand men out of Israel, of whom there were with Saul, two thousand in Michmash and in the hill-country of Bethel, and, a thousand, were with Jonathan, in Gibeah of Benjamin,but, the rest of the people, he let go, every man to his own home.

3. Then did Jonathan smite the garrison of Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it,and, Saul, blew with a horn throughout all the land saying, Let the Hebrews hear!

4. And, all Israel, heard saySaul hath smitten the garrison of the Philistines, Moreover, also, Israel have made themselves odious among the Philistines,so the people were called together to follow Saul, to Gilgal.

5. And, the Philistines, gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, a people also like the sand that is on the sea-shore for multitude,and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, east of Beth-aven.

6. So, the men of Israel, saw they were in a strait, for the people had been harassed,and the people had hidden themselves in caves, and in thickets, and among cliffs, and in holes, and in pits.

7. And, Hebrews, had passed over the Jordan, to the land of Gad, and Gilead,but, Saul, was yet in Gilgal, and all the people, trembled after him.

8. And he waited seven days, by the set time that Samuel had named, but Samuel came not to Gilgal,and the people were scattered from him.

9. Then said Saul, Bring near unto me, the ascending-sacrifice and the peace-offerings. And he offered up the ascending-sacrifice.

10. And it came to pass, as he had made an end of offering up the ascending-sacrifice, lo! Samuel, had come,and Saul went out to meet him, that he might bless him.

11. Then said SamuelWhat hast thou done? And Saul saidBecause I saw that the people had been scattered from me, and, thou, hadst not come within the appointed days, and, the Philistines, had gathered themselves together to Michmash,

12. therefore I saidNow, will the Philistines come down against me, at Gilgal, but, the face of Yahweh, have I not appeased: So I forced myself, and offered up the ascending-sacrifice.

13. And Samuel said unto SaulThou hast shewn thyself foolish,thou hast not kept the commandment of Yahweh thy God, which he commanded thee, for, now, would Yahweh have established thy kingdom unto Israel until times age-abiding;

14. Whereas, now, shall thy kingdom not be established,Yahweh hath sought out for him a man after his own heart, and Yahweh hath commanded him to be leader over his people, because thou hast not kept that which Yahweh commanded thee.

15. And Samuel arose, and ascended from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people who were found with him, about six hundred men.

16. Now, Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were found with him, were abiding in Geba of Benjamin,but, the Philistines, had encamped in Michmash.

17. And the spoilers came forth out of the camp of the Philistines, in three companies, the first company, turned unto the way of Ophrah, unto the land of Shual;

18. and, the second company, turned unto the way of Beth-horon,and, the third company, turned unto the way of the boundary that overlooketh the valley of Zeboim, towards the wilderness.

19. Now, a smith, could not be found, throughout all the land of Israelfor the Philistines had said, Lest the Hebrews make sword or spear.

20. So all Israel went down to the Philistines,to sharpen every man his share, and his mattock, and his axe, and his sickle.

21. Howbeit they had a file for the sickles, and the mattocks, and the three-pronged forks, and the axes,and for setting the goads.

22. Thus would it come to pass, in the day of battle, that there was foundneither sword nor spear, in the hand of any of the people, that were with Saul and Jonathan, but such were found belonging to Saul and to Jonathan his son.

23. Now the garrison of the Philistines had come out to the pass of Michmash.

## 1 Samuel 14

1. And it came about, on a certain day, that Jonathan son of Saul said unto the young man bearing his armour: Come! and let us pass over unto the garrison of the Philistines, that is on the other side, yonder! but, to his father, he told it not.

2. Now, Saul, was tarrying in the uttermost part of Gibeah, under the pomegranate tree that is in Migron,and, the people that were with him, were about six hundred men;

3. and, Ahijah, son of Ahitub, brother of Ichabod, son of Phinehas, son of Eli, was priest of Yahweh in Shiloh, wearing an ephod,and, the people, knew not that Jonathan had departed.

4. And, between the passes by which Jonathan sought to cross over up to the garrison of the Philistines, there was a crag of rock on the one side, and a crag of rock on the other side; and, the name of the one, was Bozez, and the name of the other, Seneh.

5. The one crag, was a pillar on the north, over against Michmash,and, the other, on the south, over against Geba.

6. So Jonathan said unto the young man bearing his armourCome! and let us cross over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised, peradventure, Yahweh may work by us,for there is no restraint with Yahweh, to save by many, or by few.

7. And his armour-bearer said to him, Do all that is in thy heart,decide for thyself (lo! I am with thee!), according to thine own heart.

8. Then said Jonathan, Lo! we, are crossing over unto the men,and will discover ourselves unto them.

9. If, thus, they say unto us, Keep quiet until we get to you, then will we stand still where we are, and will not go up unto them;

10. but, if thus, they say, Come up unto us, then will we go up; for Yahweh hath delivered them into our hand,This, then, is our sign.

11. So they two discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines,and the Philistines saidLo! Hebrews, coming forth out of the holes, wherein they had hidden themselves.

12. And the men of the garrison responded to Jonathan and his armour-bearer, and saidCome up unto us, and we will let you know a thing. Then said Jonathan unto his armour-bearerCome up after me, for Yahweh hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.

13. So Jonathan went up on his hands and on his feet, and, his armour-bearer, followed him,and they fell before Jonathan, and, his armour-bearer, was slaying after him.

14. And the first smiting wherewith Jonathan and his armour-bearer smote, was about twenty men,within, as it were, half a furrows length of a yoke of land.

15. And there came to be a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people, the outposts and the spoilers, they too, trembled,and the earth quaked, so it became a preternatural trembling.

16. And the scouts of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and lo! the camp, melted away, hither and thither.

17. Then said Saul unto the people who were with him: Number, I pray you, and see who hath departed from us. So they numbered; and lo! Jonathan and his armour-bearer were missing.

18. Then said Saul unto Ahijah, Bring near the ark of God; for the ark of God was, on that day, in the midst of the sons of Israel.

19. And it came to pass, as soon as Saul had spoken unto the priest, that, the tumultuous noise that was in the camp of the Philistines, went on and on, increasing. Then said Saul unto the priest,Withdraw thy hand.

20. And Saul and all the people that were with him gathered themselves together, and came as far as the host,and lo! the sword of every man was against his fellow, an exceeding great confusion.

21. And, the Hebrews who had aforetime belonged to the Philistines, who had come up with them in the host, even they, turned round so as to be with Israel who were with Saul and Jonathan.

22. And, all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves throughout the hill country of Ephraim, heard that the Philistines had fled, and, they also, followed hard after them in the battle.

23. Thus did Yahweh, on that day, save Israel,and, the battle, passed over by Beth-aven.

24. Now, the men of Israel, were tired out on that day,yet had Saul bound the people by an oath, sayingCursed, be the man that eateth food until the evening, and I be avenged upon mine enemies. So none of the people had tasted food.

25. And, all the land, had entered into the forest,and there was honey upon the face of the ground.

26. So the people came into the forest, and lo! there were streams of honey,but no man reached his hand to his mouth, because the people revered the oath.

27. But, Jonathan, heard not his father putting the people on oath, so he reached forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honey-copse,and brought back his hand to his mouth, and his eyes were brightened.

28. Then responded one from among the people, and saidWith an oath, did thy father charge the people, sayingCursed, be the man that eateth food to-day! And so the people were faint.

29. Then said Jonathan: My father hath afflicted the land,See, I pray you, how my own eyes have been brightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.

30. How much more if haply the people had, eaten freely, to-day of the spoil of their enemies, which they found? for, now, would not the smiting of the Philistines have been, mighty?

31. Howbeit they smote the Philistines on that day from Michmash to Aijalon,but the people became exceeding faint.

32. And the people darted greedily upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and felled them to the ground,and the people did eat, with the blood.

33. And they told Saul, saying, Lo! the people, are sinning against Yahweh, by eating with the blood. And he saidYe have dealt treacherously, roll unto me, here, a great stone.

34. And Saul saidDisperse yourselves among the people, and say unto themBring near unto me every man his ox,, and every man his lamb, and slay them here, and then eat, so shall ye not sin against Yahweh, by eating with the blood. And all the people brought nearevery man that which was in his hand, that night, and they slew them there.

35. And Saul built an altar unto Yahweh,the same, was the first altar that he built unto Yahweh.

36. Then said SaulLet us go down after the Philistines by night, and make of them a prey until the morning light, and let us not leave of them, a man. And they said, All that is good in thine eyes, do! Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.

37. So Saul asked of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not, that day.

38. Then said Saul, Come near hither, all ye chiefs of the people,and get to know and see, wherein, hath been this sin, to-day.

39. For, by the life of Yahweh, who saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, yet shall he, die. But there was none ready to answer him, of all the people.

40. Then said he unto all IsraelYe, shall be on one side, and, I and Jonathan my son, will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, What is good in thine eyes, do!

41. And Saul said unto YahwehO God of Israel! now set forth the truth. Then were, Jonathan and Saul, taken, and, the people, escaped.

42. And Saul said, Cast lots between me, and Jonathan my son. Then was, Jonathan, taken.

43. And Saul said unto Jonathan, Come tell me, what thou hast done. So Jonathan told him, and said, I, just tasted, with the end of the staff that was in my hand, a little honey, here I amI must die!

44. Then said Saul: So, may God do, and, so, may he add, surely thou must, die, Jonathan!

45. But the people said unto SaulShall, Jonathan, die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far be it! By the life of Yahweh, there shall not fall a hair of his head to the ground, for, with God, hath he wrought this day. So the people delivered Jonathan, that he died not.

46. Then Saul went up from following the Philistines,and, the Philistines, departed unto their own place.

47. And, Saul, took possession of the kingdom over Israel,and made war round about against all his enemiesagainst Moab, and against the sons of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines, and, whomsoever he turned against, he was victorious.

48. Then made he ready a force, and smote the Amalekites,and delivered Israel out of the hand of such as plundered them.

49. And the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua,and, the names of his two daughters, were, the name of the firstborn, Merab, and, the name of the younger, Michal,

50. and, the name of Sauls wife, was Ahinoam, daughter of Ahimaaz,and the name of the prince of his host, Abner, son of Ner, Sauls uncle.

51. And, Kish, was Sauls father, and, Ner, Abners father, was son of Abiel.

52. And the war was severe against the Philistines all the days of Saul,and, whensoever Saul saw any mighty man, or any son of valour, he drew him unto himself.

## 1 Samuel 15

1. And Samuel said unto Saul, It was, me, Yahweh sent to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel,now, therefore, hearken thou to the voice of Yahwehs words.

2. Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, I have well considered what Amalek did unto Israelhow he lay in wait for him in the way, when he came up out of Egypt.

3. Now, go and smite Amalek, and devote ye to destruction all that he hath, and spare him not,but thou shalt slay both man and woman, both child and suckling, both ox and sheep, both camel and ass.

4. So then Saul called together the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen,and ten thousand men of Judah.

5. And Saul came as far as the city of Amalek,and stirred up strife in the ravine.

6. Then said Saul unto the KenitesGo, depart, get you down out of the midst of the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them, yet, ye, dealt in lovingkindness, with all the sons of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed out of the midst of the Amalekites.

7. And Saul smote Amalek,from Havilah, till thou enterest Shur, which is over against Egypt.

8. And he took Agag, king of Amalek, alive,but, all the people, devoted he to destruction at the edge of the sword.

9. But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep and the oxen and the lambs, also the fatlings, and all that was good, and would not devote them to destruction,but, all the cattle that was contemptible and diseased, that, devoted they to destruction.

10. Then came the word of Yahweh unto Samuel, saying

11. I am grieved that I made Saul to be king, for he hath turned back from following me, and, my words, hath he not established. And it was vexing to Samuel, so that he made outcry unto Yahweh, all the night.

12. And Samuel rose early to meet Saul, in the morning, and it was told Samuel, sayingSaul having come to Carmel, and lo! having set him up a sign, hath gone round, and passed over, and descended to Gilgal.

13. And Samuel came unto Saul,and Saul said unto himBlessed, be thou by Yahweh: I have established the word of Yahweh.

14. And Samuel said, What then is this bleating of sheep, in mine ears,and the lowing of oxen, which I can hear?

15. Then said SaulFrom the Amalekites, have they brought them in; in that the people spared the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto Yahweh thy God,but, the rest, have we devoted to destruction.

16. Then said Samuel unto Saul, Stay, and let me tell thee, that which Yahweh hath spoken unto me, this night. And he said to himSpeak.

17. And Samuel said, Was it not, when, little, thou wast in thine own eyes, that thou wast made, head of the tribes of Israel,and that Yahweh anointed thee to be king over Israel?

18. So then Yahweh sent thee on a journey,and saidGo, and devastate to destruction, the sinnersthe Amalekites, and make war against them, until they have consumed them.

19. Wherefore, then, didst thou not hearken unto the voice of Yahweh,but didst rush upon the spoil, and do that which was wrong in the sight of Yahweh?

20. And Saul said unto SamuelAs indeed I have hearkened unto the voice of Yahweh, and have been on the journey on which Yahweh sent me,and have brought in Agag, king of Amalek, and, the Amalekites, have I devoted to destruction.

21. And the people took, of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things so devoted,to sacrifice unto Yahweh thy God, in Gilgal.

22. Then said SamuelDoth that which is pleasing unto Yahweh consist in ascending-offerings and sacrifices, So much as in hearkening unto the voice of Yahweh? Lo! to hearken, is, better, than, sacrifice. And, to give heed, than, the fat of rams;

23. For, as the sin of divination, is, rebelliousness,and, as transgression with household gods, is, stubbornness,Because thou hast rejected the word of Yahweh, therefore hath he rejected thee from being king.

24. Then said Saul unto SamuelI have sinned; for I have transgressed the bidding of Yahweh, and thy words,for I feared the people, and hearkened unto their voice.

25. Now, therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin,and turn again with me, that I may bow down unto Yahweh.

26. And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not turn again with thee,Because thou hast rejected the word of Yahweh, therefore hath Yahweh rejected thee from being king over Israel.

27. And, when Samuel turned about to go away, then laid he hold of the skirt of his robe, and it was rent.

28. And Samuel said unto him, Yahweh hath rent the kingdom of Israel from off thee, to-day,and will give it unto a neighbour of thine, who is better than thou.

29. Moreover also, the Eminence of Israel, will not lie, neither will he repent,For no, iron of earth, is, he, to repent!

30. Then he said: I have sinned, Now, honour me, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel,and turn again with me, then will I bow down unto Yahweh thy God.

31. So then Samuel turned again, after Sauland Saul bowed down unto Yahweh.

32. Then said SamuelBring ye near unto meAgag, king of Amalek, And Agag came unto him, in fetters. Then said Agag, Surely, terrible, is the bitterness of death!

33. And Samuel said, As women have been made childless by thy sword, So, childless among women, shall be, thine own mother. And Samuel cut Agag asunder before Yahweh, in Gilgal.

34. Then Samuel departed unto Ramah,but, Saul, went up unto his own house, at Gibeah of Saul.

35. And Samuel did no more see Saul, until the day of his death, for Samuel pined for Saul,but, Yahweh, was grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel.

## 1 Samuel 16

1. And Yahweh said unto SamuelHow long, art thou going to pine for Saul, seeing that, I, have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill thy horn with oil, and come! let me send thee unto Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided me, among his sons, a king.

2. And Samuel said, How can I go? As soon as Saul heareth, he will slay me. Then said Yahweh, A heifer, take thou with thee, and say, To sacrifice unto Yahweh, am I come.

3. Then shall thou bid Jesse to the sacrifice,when, I, will let thee know what thou must do, so shalt thou anoint for me him whom I shall name unto thee.

4. And Samuel did that which Yahweh had spoken, and went to Bethlehem. And the elders of the city came trembling to meet him, and one saidPeaceably, comest thou?

5. And he saidPeaceably: to sacrifice unto Yahweh, am I come. Hallow yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he hallowed Jesse and his sons, and bade them to the sacrifice.

6. And it came to pass, when they entered, that he looked upon Eliab,and said to himself, Surely, before Yahweh, is his Anointed.

7. But Yahweh said unto SamuelDo not regard his countenance, or the height of his stature, for I have rejected him,for it is not what man looketh to but what God looketh to. For, man, looketh to the outward appearance, but, Yahweh, looketh to the heart.

8. Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel,and he said, Neither of this one, hath Yahweh made choice.

9. Then Jesse made Shammah pass by,and he saidNor of this one, hath Yahweh made choice.

10. So Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel,and Samuel said unto Jesse, Yahweh hath not made choice of these.

11. Then said Samuel unto JesseAre these all the young men? And he saidThere yet remaineth, the youngest, but lo! he is tending the sheep. Then said Samuel unto JesseDo, send, and summon him, for we cannot sit round, until he cometh in hither.

12. So he sent, and brought him in. Now, he, was ruddy, a stripling with handsome eyes, and noble mien. Then said YahwehRiseanoint him, for, this, is, he.

13. And Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren. And the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily upon David, from that day forward. Then arose Samuel, and went his way unto Ramah.

14. But, the spirit of Yahweh, departed from Saul,and there terrified him a sad spirit, from Yahweh.

15. Then said the servants of Saul unto him,Lo! we pray thee, a sad superhuman spirit, doth terrify thee:

16. Pray let our lord bid thy servants before thee, seek out a man, skilled in playing on the lyre,so shall it be, when a sad superhuman spirit cometh on thee, then shall he play with his hand, and thou shalt be joyful.

17. And Saul said unto his servants,I pray you, look out for me a man that excelleth in playing, and bring him in unto me.

18. Then responded one of the young men and saidLo! I have seena son of Jesse, the Bethlehemite, skilled in playing, and a mighty man of valour, and a man of war, and of intelligent speech, and a handsome man, and, Yahweh, is with him.

19. So Saul sent messengers unto Jesse,and said, Send, unto meDavid thy son, who is with the sheep.

20. Then took Jesse an ass laden with bread, and a skin of wine, and one kid,and sent by the hand of David his son, unto Saul.

21. And David came in unto Saul,and stood before him,and he loved him greatly, and he became his armour-bearer.

22. And Saul sent unto Jesse, saying,I pray thee, let David stand before me, for he hath found favour in mine eyes.

23. And so it used to be, when a superhuman spirit came unto Saul, then would David take the lyre, and play with his hand,and Saul would be refreshed, and be joyful, and, the sad spirit, would depart from him.

## 1 Samuel 17

1. And the Philistines gathered together their hosts, unto battle, and they were gathered together unto Socoh, which belongeth unto Judah,and they encamped between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes-dammim;

2. and, Saul and the men of Israel, gathered themselves together, and encamped in the vale of Elah, and set the army in array against the Philistines.

3. And, the Philistines, were standing near the hill on one side, and, the Israelites, were standing near the hill on the other side,while, the valley, was between them.

4. And there came forth a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, Goliath, his name, from Gath,his height, six cubits and a span;

5. with a helmet of bronze on his head, and, with a scaly coat of mail, was he clad,the weight of the coat, being five thousand shekels of bronze;

6. and, greaves of bronze, on his feet,and, a javelin of bronze, between his shoulders;

7. and, the shaft of his spear, was like a weavers beam, and, the flashing head of his spear, was six hundred shekels of iron,and, his shield-bearer, was coming on before him.

8. And he took his stand, and cried unto the ranks of Israel, and said unto them, Wherefore should ye come out, to set in array for battle? Am not, I, a Philistine, while, ye, are servants unto Saul? Choose you a man, and let him come down unto me:

9. If he prevail in fighting with me, and smite me, then will we become your servants,but, if, I, prevail over him, and smite him, then shall ye become our servants, and serve, us.

10. And the Philistine saidI, reproach the ranks of Israel, this day,give me a man, that we may fight together.

11. When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and feared exceedingly.

12. Now, David, was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem-judah, whose, name, was Jesse, and, who, had eight sons,and, the man, in the days of Saul was old, advanced in years.

13. And the three eldest sons of Jesse had followed Saul to the battle,and, the names of his three sons who went into the battle, were Eliab the firstborn, and, the next to him, Abinadab, and, the third, Shammah.

14. But, as for David, he, was the youngest,and, the three eldest, followed Saul;

15. whereas, David, kept going and returning from Saul,to tend his fathers sheep at Bethlehem.

16. And the Philistine drew near morning and evening,and presented himself forty days.

17. And Jesse said unto David his son, Take, I pray thee, unto thy brethrenthis ephah of parched corn, and these ten loaves,and run to the camp unto thy brethren;

18. also these ten slices of soft cheese, shalt thou take to the captain of their thousand,and, as for thy brethren, give good heed to their welfare, their pledge, also shalt thou receive.

19. Now, Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the vale of Elah, ready to fight with the Philistines.

20. So then David rose up early in the morning, and entrusted the sheep to a keeper, and took up   and went his way, as Jesse had commanded him,and came into the circular rampart, as, the force, was going forth into the ranks, and shouted for the fight.

21. So Israel and the Philistines set in array for battle, army against army.

22. Then David entrusted the provisions that were upon him to the care of the keeper of the stores, and ran unto the ranks,and came and asked for the welfare of his brethren.

23. Now, as he was speaking with them, lo! the champion coming up, Goliath the Philistine, by name, of Gath,   .

24. Now, all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from before him, and feared exceedingly.

25. And the men of Israel saidHave ye seen this man that is coming up? For, to reproach Israel, is he coming. So then it shall be, that, the man that shall smite him, the same, will the king enrich with great riches, and, his own daughter, will give him, and, his fathers house, will he make free in Israel.

26. Then spake David unto the men that were standing by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that shall smite yonder Philistine, and so shall take away reproach from off Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he hath reproached the ranks of a Living God?

27. And the people answered him, according to this word saying,So, shall it be done to the man that shall smite him.

28. Now Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men,then was kindled the anger of Eliab against David, and he saidWherefore is it that thou hast come down? and to whom hast thou entrusted those few sheep in the wilderness? I, know thy pride, and the foolishness of thy heart, for, to see the battle, hast thou come down.

29. And David said, What have I done, now? Was there not, a cause?

30. Then turned he from him unto another, and saidaccording to this word,and the people returned him an answer, like the first.

31. And the words which David spake were overheard,and, when they told them before Saul, he summoned him.

32. And David said unto Saul, Let not the heart of my lord fail, because of him,thy servant, will go, and fight with this Philistine.

33. And Saul said unto DavidThou art not able to go against this Philistine, to fight with him,for, a youth, art, thou, but, he, a man of war, from his youth.

34. Then said David unto Saul, Thy servant used to tend his fathers sheep,and there would come a lion, or a bear, and carry off a lamb out of the flock;

35. and I would go out after him, and smite him, and rescue it out of his mouth,and, if he rose against me, I would catch him by his beard, and smite him, and slay him.

36. Thy servant could slay, either a lion or a bear,and, this uncircumcised Philistine, shall become, as one of them, for he hath reproached the ranks of a Living God.

37. And David said, Yahweh, who hath rescued me out of the power of the lion, and out of the power of the bear, he, will rescue us out of the hand of this Philistine. Then said Saul unto DavidGo! and, Yahweh, will be with thee.

38. And Saul clad David with his own military coat, and set a helmet of bronze upon his head,and clad him with a coat of mail.

39. And David girded his sword above his military coat, but was reluctant to go, for he had not proved them,so David said unto SaulI cannot go in these, for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.

40. Then took he his stick in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the torrent-bed, and put them in the shepherds-pouch which he hadeven in the wallet, and had his sling in his hand,and so drew near unto the Philistine.

41. And the Philistine came on and on, and drew near unto David,and the man carrying the shield was before him.

42. And, when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him,for he was a youth, and ruddy, a stripling of fair countenance.

43. Then said the Philistine unto David, A dog, am, I, that thou art coming unto me, with sticks? And the Philistine cursed David, by his god.

44. And the Philistine said unto David,Come, unto me, that I may give thy flesh to the birds of heaven, and to the beasts of the field.

45. Then said David unto the PhilistineThou, art coming unto me with sword, and with spear, and with javelin,but, I, am coming unto thee in the name of Yahweh of hosts, God of the ranks of Israel which thou hast reproached.

46. This day, will Yahweh deliver thee into my hand, and I will smite thee, and take thy head from off thee, and will give thy dead body and the dead bodies of the host of Philistines, this day, unto the birds of heaven, and unto the wild beasts of the earth,that all the earth may know that Israel hath a God;

47. and that all this gathered host may know that, not with sword and with spear, doth Yahweh save,for, unto Yahweh, belongeth the battle, and he will deliver you into our hand.

48. And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew near to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the ranks to meet the Philistine.

49. And David thrust his hand into his pouch, and took from thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine, in his forehead,that the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell upon his face, to the earth.

50. Thus David prevailed over the Philistine, with the sling and with the stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him,but, sword, was there none in the hand of David.

51. So David ran, and stood by the Philistine, and took his sword and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off, therewith, his head,and, when the Philistines saw that their hero was slain, they fled.

52. Then arose the men of Israel and Judah, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, as far as the entrance into Gath, and as far as the gates of Ekron,and the slain of the Philistines fell in the way to the two gates, even as far as Gath and as far as Ekron.

53. And the sons of Israel returned from hotly pursuing the Philistines,and plundered their camps.

54. And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it into Jerusalem,but, his armour, put he into his tent.

55. And, when Saul saw David going forth to meet the Philistine, he said unto Abner, prince of the host, Whose son is the young man, Abner? And Abner said, By the life of thy soul, O king! I know not.

56. Then said the king,Ask, thou, whose son the stripling is?

57. And, when David returned from smiting the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul,with the head of the Philistine in his hand.

58. And Saul said unto him, Whose son art, thou, O young man? And David said, Son of thy servant Jesse, the Bethlehemite.

## 1 Samuel 18

1. And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that, the soul of Jonathan, was knit with, the soul of David, so that Jonathan loved him, as his own soul.

2. And Saul took him, that day,and suffered him not to return unto the house of his father.

3. And Jonathan and David solemnised a covenant,because he loved him as his own soul.

4. And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe which was upon him, and gave it to David,and his equipments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.

5. And David went forthwhithersoever Saul sent him, he behaved himself prudently, so Saul set him over the men of war,and he became a favourite in the eyes of all the people, yea even in the eyes of the servants of Saul.

6. But so it was, when they came in on the return of David from the smiting of the Philistine, that the women went forth out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet Saul the king,with timbrels, with rejoicing, and with instruments of three strings.

7. And the women that made merry responded to each other in song, and said,Saul, hath smitten, his thousands, but, David, his, tens of thousands.

8. Then was Saul exceeding angry, and this saying was offensive in his eyes, and he said,They have ascribed, to David, ten thousands, but, to me, have they ascribed thousands,What, more, then, can he have but, the kingdom?

9. And Saul was eyeing David from that day forward.

10. And, when it came to pass, on the morrow, that a superhuman spirit of sadness came suddenly upon Saul, and he was moved to raving in the midst of the house,and, David, began playing with his hand, as he had done day by day, that a spear being in Sauls hand,

11. Saul hurled the spear, and said to himselfI will smite David, even to the wall! But David moved round from before him, twice.

12. And Saul feared because of David,for Yahweh was with him, whereas, from Saul, he had departed.

13. So Saul removed him from him, and appointed him to be for him the captain of a thousand,and he went out and came in before the people.

14. And it came to pass that David, in all his ways, acted prudently,and, Yahweh, was with him.

15. And, when Saul saw that, he, was acting very prudently, he was afraid of him.

16. But, all Israel and Judah, were in love with David,for he was going out and coming in before them.

17. So then Saul said unto DavidLo! my elder daughter Merab, her, will I give thee to wife, only, approve thyself unto me as a son of valour and fight the battles of Yahweh. Saul, however, had said to himselfLet not, my own hand, be upon him, but let, the hand of the Philistines, be upon him.

18. And David said unto SaulWho am, I, or who are my kinsfolk, the family of my father, in Israel,that I should become son-in-law, to the king?

19. But it came to pass, within the time for giving Merab daughter of Saul to David, that, she, was given to Adriel the Meholathite, to wife.

20. Then did Michal, Sauls daughter, love David,and it was told Saul, and the thing was right in his eyes.

21. And Saul said to himselfI will give her unto him, that she may prove to him a snare, and that, the hand of the Philistines, may be upon him. So then Saul said unto David, A second time, mayest thou become my son-in-law to-day.

22. And Saul commanded his servantsSpeak ye unto David quietly saying, Lo! the king delighteth in thee, and, all his servants, love thee,now, therefore, become thou son-in-law to the king.

23. And the servants of Saul spake, in the ears of David, these words. And David saidSeemeth it a light thing, in your eyes, to become son-in-law to the king, seeing that, I, am a poor man and lightly esteemed?

24. So the servants of Saul told him, saying,According to these words, spake David,

25. Then said SaulThus, shall ye say unto DavidThe king hath no delight in purchase-price, but rather in a hundred foreskins of Philistines, by avenging himself on the enemies of the king. But, Saul, thought to let David fall by the hand of the Philistines.

26. So, when his servants told David these words, the thing was right in the eyes of David, to become son-in-law unto the king,and the days had not expired.

27. Wherefore David arose, and wenthe and his men, and smote among the Philistines two hundred men, and David brought in their foreskins, and gave them in full tale unto the king, that he might become son-in-law unto the king, and Saul gave him Michal his daughter, to wife.

28. And Saul saw and knew that, Yahweh, was with David, and that, all Israel, loved him.

29. So then Saul went on to fear because of David, yet more,and it came to pass that Saul was hostile to David, all the days.

30. And, when the princes of the Philistines came forth, so it was, that, as often as they came forth, David was more circumspect than any of the servants of Saul, so that his name was, precious exceedingly.

## 1 Samuel 19

1. Then spake Saul unto Jonathan his son, and unto all his servants, that they should put David to death;

2. but, Jonathan, Sauls son, delighted in David, exceedingly,so Jonathan told David, saying, Saul, my father, is seeking to put thee to death,now, therefore, take heed to thyself I pray thee, in the morning, and abide thou in concealment, and hide thyself;

3. and, I, will come out and stand beside my father, in the field where, thou, art, and, I, will speak of thee unto my father,and, if I see aught, I will tell thee.

4. So then Jonathan spake of David things that were good, unto Saul his father,and said unto himMay the king not sin against his servantagainst David; for he hath not sinned against, thee, nay, indeed, his doings have been good to theeward exceedingly.

5. And, when he put his life in his hand, and smote the Philistine, and Yahweh wrought a great victory for all Israel, thou sawest, and didst rejoice. Wherefore, then, shouldst thou sin against innocent blood by putting David to death, without cause?

6. And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan,and Saul sware, By the life of Yahweh, he shall not be put to death!

7. And Jonathan called for David, and Jonathan told him all these things,and Jonathan brought in David unto Saul, and so he was in his presence, as aforetime.

8. But, when the war again brake out,and David went forth and fought with the Philistines, and smote them with a great smiting, and they fled before him,

9. then came there a sad spirit of Yahweh unto Saul, he being in his house, seated, with his spear in his hand,while, David, played with his hand,

10. Saul sought to smite David with the spear, even to the wall, but he slipped away from before Saul, who smote the spear into the wall,whereas, David, fled and escaped, that night.

11. And Saul sent messengers unto Davids house, to watch him, and to put him to death, in the morning! And Michal his wife told David, saying, If thou do not deliver thyself to-night, to-morrow, art thou to be put to death.

12. So Michal let down David, through the window, and he departed and fled, and escaped.

13. And Michal took the household god, and put it in the bed, and, a fly-net of goats-hair, put she at its head,and covered it with the clothes.

14. And, when Saul sent messengers to take David, she saidHe is, sick.

15. So Saul sent messengers to see David, saying,Bring him up in the bed unto me, that I may put him to death.

16. And, when the messengers entered, lo! the household god in the bed,with a fly-net of goats-hair at its head.

17. And Saul said unto MichalWherefore, in this way, hast thou deceived me, and let go mine enemy, that he hath escaped? Then said Michal unto Saul, He, himself, said unto meLet me go, wherefore should I put thee to death?

18. So, David, fled, and escaped, and came in unto Samuel in Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him,and he and Samuel departed, and dwelt in Naioth.

19. And it was told Saul, saying,Lo! David, is in Naioth, in Ramah.

20. So Saul sent messengers to take David, but, when they saw the assembly of prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, then came the Spirit of God upon the messengers of Saul, and, they also, were, moved to prophesy.

21. And, when they told Saul, and he sent other messengers, then were, they also, moved to prophesy. And, when Saul again sent messengers a third time, then were, they also, moved to prophesy.

22. Then went, he also himself, to Ramah, and came in as far as the well of the threshing-floor which is in Sephi, and asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one saidLo! in Naioth, in Ramah.

23. And, when he departed from thence towards Naioth in Ramah, then came upon, him also, the Spirit of God, and he went on and on, and was moved to prophesy, until he entered Naioth in Ramah.

24. And, even he, stripped off his upper garments, and, even he, was moved to prophesy before Samuel, and lay prostrate, disrobed, all that day, and all the night. For this cause, do they say, Is, even Saul, among the prophets?

## 1 Samuel 20

1. And David fled from Naioth, in Ramah,and came in, and said before JonathanWhat have I done? What is my transgression, and what my sin, before thy father, that he seeketh my life?

2. And he said unto himFar be it! thou shalt not die. Lo! my father doeth nothing, great or small, without unveiling mine ear,wherefore, then, should my father hide from me, this thing? There is, nothing, in this.

3. But David sware yet further, and saidThy father, doth know, that I have found favour in thine eyes, therefore saith he,Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he grieve; but, indeed, by the life of Yahweh, and by the life of thine own soul, surely there is but as it were a step betwixt me and death!

4. And Jonathan said unto David,Whatsoever thy soul shall desire, I will do for thee.

5. And David said unto JonathanLo! the new moon, is to-morrow, and, I, must not sit with the king, to eat,let me go then, and hide myself in the field, until the evening.

6. If thy father, enquire, for me, then shalt thou sayDavid, did ask leave, of me, to run to Bethlehem, his own city, for, a yearly sacrifice,   there for all the family.

7. If, thus, he sayIt is well,thy servant shall have, peace,but, if it, anger, him, know that harm hath been determined by him.

8. Thus shalt thou do a lovingkindness for thy servant, for, into a covenant of Yahweh, hast thou brought thy servant, with thee,But, if there is in me transgression, put me to death, thyself, for, unto thy father, wherefore shouldst thou bring me in?

9. And Jonathan saidFar be it from thee! but, if I, get to know, that harm is determined by my father, to bring it upon thee, is not, that, the thing that I will tell thee?

10. Then said David unto Jonathan, Who shall tell me,if thy father answer thee aught that is, harsh?

11. And Jonathan said unto David, Come! and let us go out into the field. And they two went out into the field.

12. Then said Jonathan unto DavidWitness   Yahweh God of Israel, that I will sound my father about this time to-morrow or the third day, and lo! if there he good towards David, will I not, then, send unto thee, and unveil thine ear?

13. So, let Yahweh do unto Jonathan, and, so, let him addwhen harm against thee seemeth good unto my father, then will I unveil thine ear, and let thee go, and thou shall depart in peace,then Yahweh be with thee, as he hath been with my father.

14. And, not only while I yet live, shalt thou deal with me in the lovingkindness of Yahweh, that I die not:

15. but thou shalt not cut off thy lovingkindness from my house, unto times age-abiding,no! not when Yahweh hath cut off the enemies of David, every one from off the face of the ground.

16. Thus Jonathan solemnised a covenant with the house of David   ,So let Yahweh require it, at the hand of the enemies of David.

17. And again Jonathan sware unto David, by his love to him,for, as he loved his own soul, so loved he him.

18. Then said Jonathan unto himTo-morrow, is the new moon, and thou wilt be missed, for thy seat will be empty;

19. and, when thou hast tarried three days, thou shalt come down quickly and enter the place, where thou didst hide thyself on the day of the deed, and shall remain by the side of this mound.

20. And, as for methree arrows to the side, will I shoot,as though I shot at a mark.

21. And lo! I will send the boy   , by the life of Yahweh.

22. But, if, thus, I say to the youth, Lo! the arrows are beyond thee, depart, for Yahweh hath sent thee away.

23. But, as touching the matter whereof we spakeI and thou, lo! Yahweh, be betwixt me and thee, unto times age-abiding.

24. So David hid himself in the fieldand, when the new moon had come, the king sat down to eat, food,

25. yea the king sat down on his seat, as at other times, by the seat against the wall, and, when Jonathan arose, Abner seated himself by the side of Saul,but Davids place was empty.

26. Saul, however, spake nothing that day,for he said to himselfIt is, an accident, he is, not clean, because he hath not been cleansed.

27. And it came to pass, on the morrow, the second of the month, that Davids place was empty,and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore hath not the son of Jesse come in, either yesterday or to-day, to meat?

28. And Jonathan answered Saul,David, asked leave, of me,   as far as Bethlehem;

29. and saidLet me go, I pray thee, for, a family sacrifice, have we in the city, and my brethren have commanded me, now, therefore, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me slip away, I pray thee, that I may see my brethren. For this cause, hath he not come in unto the table of the king.

30. Then was Sauls anger kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of rebellious perversity! do I not know that thou art, confederate, with the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and to the confusion of the shame of thy mother?

31. For, as long as, the son of Jesse, liveth on the ground, thou wilt not be established, thou nor thy kingdom, Now, therefore, send and fetch him unto me, for, doomed to death, is he!

32. And Jonathan responded to Saul his father,and said unto himWherefore must he be put to death, What hath he done?

33. And Saul hurled his spear at him, to smite him. So Jonathan knew that it was, determined, of his father, to put David to death.

34. Jonathan therefore rose up from the table, in a glow of anger,and did eat no food on the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father had reviled him.

35. And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went forth into the field, to the place appointed with David,a little lad, being with him.

36. And he said to his ladRun, find, I pray thee, the arrows which I am about to shoot. The boy, ran, but, he, shot the arrow beyond him.

37. And, when the lad came as far as the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow, beyond, thee?

38. And Jonathan cried after the lad, Haste theebe quick, do not stay! so Jonathans lad picked up the arrows and brought   unto his master.

39. But, the lad, knew, nothing, only Jonathan and David, knew the matter.

40. So Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad, and said to him, Go carry them into the city.

41. As soon as, the lad, was gone, David, arose from beside the South, and fell on his face to the earth, and bowed himself down three times,and they kissed each other, and wept over each other, until, David, exceeded.

42. Then said Jonathan unto DavidGo in peace,

## 1 Samuel 21

1. Then came David to Nob, unto Ahimelech, the priest,and Ahimelech trembled when he met David, and said unto himWhy art thou, alone, and, no man, with thee?

2. And David said unto Ahimelech the priestThe king, hath charged me with a matter, and hath said unto meLet, no man, know aught of the business on which I am sending thee, and with which I have charged thee,But, unto the young men, have I appointed, such and such a place.

3. Now, therefore, what is there under thy hand? Five loaves, give thou into my hand,or, whatever can be found.

4. And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand,but, hallowed bread, there is, if the young men have kept themselves, at least from women.

5. And David answered the priest and said to himOf a truth, women, have been withheld from us, of late, through my coming out, and the wallets of the young men have become hallowed,while   to be hallowed, in the vessel.

6. So the priest gave him hallowed   ,because there was there no bread, save the Presence-Bread, which had to be removed from before Yahweh, to put hot bread, on the day when it should be taken away.

7. Now, in that very place, was a man of the servants of Saul, on that day, detained before Yahweh, whose name, was Doeg the Edomite,chief of the shepherds that belonged unto Saul.

8. Then said David to Ahimelech, See whether there is here, under thy hand, a spear or a sword? for, neither my sword, nor my other weapons, did I take in my hand, for, the kings business, was, urgent.

9. And the priest said: The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou didst smite in the vale of Elah, lo! that, is wrapped up in a cloth, behind the ephod, if, that, thou wilt take to thee, take it, for there is no other, save that, here. And David saidThere is none, like it, give it me.

10. Then arose David, and fled, that day, from the face of Saul,and came in unto Achish, king of Gath.

11. And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not, this, David, king of the land? Was it not, of this man, that they kept responding in the dances, saying, Saul, hath smitten his, thousands, but, David, his, tens of thousands?

12. And David laid up these words in his heart,and feared greatly, because of Achish king of Gath.

13. So he feigned himself mad, in their sight, and raged in their hand,and struck against the doors of the gate, and let his spittle run down upon his beard.

14. Then said Achish unto his servants,Lo! ye can see, a madman playing his pranks, wherefore should ye bring him in, unto me?

15. Lacking of madmen, am I that ye should bring in this one to play his mad pranks, unto me? Shall, this, one enter my household?

## 1 Samuel 22

1. David therefore departed thence, and escaped, into the cave of Adullam,and, when his brethren and all the household of his father heard it, they went down unto him, thither.

2. And there gathered themselves unto himevery one that was in distress, and every one that had a creditor, and every one embittered in soul, and he came to be over them as a prince,and there were with him, about four hundred men.

3. And David departed thence, to Mizpah of Moab,and said unto the king of Moab, I pray thee, let my father and my mother dwell with you, until that I know what God will do for me.

4. So he set them before the king of Moab,and they dwelt with him, all the days that David was in the fortress.

5. Then said Gad the prophet unto DavidThou must not abide in the fortress, go and get thee into the land of Judah. So David departed, and entered the forest of Hereth.

6. And, when Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with himSaul, being seated in Gibeah under the tamarisk-tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants stationed by him,

7. then said Saul unto his servants who were stationed by himHear, I pray you, ye Benjamites! What! even to all of you, will the son of Jesse give fields and vineyards? All of you, will he appoint to be princes of thousands, and princes of hundreds?

8. That ye have conspired, all of you, against me, and there is none to uncover mine ear as to the covenanting of my son with the son of Jesse? And none from among you that taketh pity upon me, and that uncovereth mine ear   ,that, mine own son, hath stirred up, my servants, against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?

9. Then answered Doeg the Edomitehe, being stationed near the servants of Sauland said,I saw the son of Jesse coming into Nob, unto Ahimelech son of Ahitub;

10. Then enquired he for him of Yahweh, Provisions also, gave he unto him,and, the sword of Goliath the Philistine, gave he unto him.

11. Then the king sent to call Ahimelech, son of Ahitub, the priest, and all the house of his fatherthe priests, who were in Nob,and they came, all of them, unto the king.

12. And Saul said, Hear, I pray thee, thou son of Ahitub! And he saidBehold me! my lord.

13. And Saul said unto him, Wherefore have ye conspired against me, thou, and the son of Jesse,in that thou gavest him bread and a sword, and didst enquire for him of God, that he might rise up against me, that he might lie in wait, as at this day?

14. Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said,But who, among all thy servants, like David, is, faithful, being son-in-law to the king, and, cometh near to have audience with thee, and is, honoured in thy household?

15. Did I, that day, begin to enquire for him of God? Far from me! Let not the king impute to his servant such a thing, nor to any of the household of my father, for thy servant knoweth nothing of all this, less or more.

16. And the king said: Thou shalt, die, Ahimelech,thou and all the household of thy father.

17. And the king said unto the runners that were stationed by himTurn ye round and put to death the priests of Yahweh, because, their hand also, is with David, and because they knew that he was, in flight, and unveiled not mine ear. But the servants of the king were not willing to thrust forth their hand, to fall upon the priests of Yahweh.

18. Then said the king to Doeg, Turn, thou, and fall upon the priests. So Doeg the Edomite turned, and, himself, fell upon the priests, and put to death, that day, four score and five men bearing an ephod of linen;

19. Nob also, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings,and oxen and asses and sheep, with the edge of the sword.

20. But there escaped one son of Ahimelech, son of Ahitub, whose, name, was Abiathar,and he fled after David.

21. So Abiathar told David,that Saul had slain the priests of Yahweh.

22. Then said David to AbiatharI knew, that day, when Doeg the Edomite was, there, that he would, surely tell, Saul. I, am chargeable with all the lives of the house of thy father.

23. Abide with me! do not fear, for, whoso seeketh my life, seeketh thy life,for, in safeguard, shall thou be, with me.

## 1 Samuel 23

1. Then told they David, saying,Lo! the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and they are plundering the threshing-floors.

2. So David enquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And Yahweh said unto DavidGo, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.

3. But the men of David said unto him, Lo! we, here, in Judah, are afraid,how much more, then, if we go to Keilah, against the ranks of the Philistines?

4. So David yet again enquired if Yahweh, and Yahweh answered him,and saidArise, go down to Keilah, for I am about to deliver the Philistines into thy hand.

5. David therefore went, with his men, to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and drave forth their cattle, and smote them, with a great smiting, so David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.

6. Now it came to pass, when Abiathar, son of Ahimelech, fled unto David to Keilah, that he came down with, an ephod, in his hand.

7. And, when it was told Saul that David had entered Keilah, Saul saidGod hath given him over into my hand, for he hath shut himself in by entering into a city with folding doors and bar.

8. So Saul summoned all the people to war,to go down to Keilah, to besiege David, and his men.

9. And David ascertained that, against him, Saul was contriving mischief,so he said unto Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.

10. Then said David: O Yahweh, God of Israel, thy servant, hath heard, that Saul is seeking to come unto Keilah,to destroy the city, for my sake:

11. Will the owners of Keilah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O Yahweh, God of Israel, I pray thee, tell thy servant. And Yahweh saidHe will come down.

12. Then said David, Will the owners of Keilah surrender me and my men, into the hand of Saul? And Yahweh saidThey will surrender.

13. Then arose David and his men, about six hundred, and went forth out of Keilah, and went to and fro, whithersoever they could,and, unto Saul, it was told that David had escaped out of Keilah, so he forbare to go forth.

14. Then David abode in the wilderness, in the fortresses, and he abode in the hill country, in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him continually, but God delivered him not into his hand.

15. Then David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life, David, being in the wilderness of Ziph, in the thicket.

16. So Jonathan, Sauls son, arose and went unto David in the thicket,and strengthened his hand in God;

17. and said unto him,Do not fear, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee, but, thou, shalt become king over Israel, and, I, shall be, next, unto thee, yea and, Saul my father, knoweth this.

18. And they two solemnised a covenant before Yahweh,and David remained in the thicket, but, Jonathan, departed to his own house.

19. Then came up the Ziphites unto Saul in Gibeah, saying,Is not David hiding himself with us, in the strongholds in the thicket, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the right of Jeshimon?

20. Now, therefore, according to all the desire of thy soul O king, to come down, come! and, ours,   to surrender him into the hand of the king.

21. Then said Saul, Blessed, be ye, of Yahweh,because ye have taken pity upon me.

22. Go, I pray you, make ready yet further, and get to know and see his place, where may be his track, who hath seen him there,for it hath been said unto me, Cunning indeed, is, he!

23. See, then, and get to knowof all the hiding places, where he hideth himself, and return unto me, for certainty, then will I go with you,and it shall be, if he is in the land, that I will search him out, through all the thousands of Judah.

24. So they arose and departed to Ziph, before Saul,but, David and his men, were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah, to the right of Jeshimon.

25. Then Saul and his men departed, to seek   ; but it had been told David, and he had gone down the cliff, and taken up his abode in the wilderness of Maon,and when Saul had, heard it, he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon.

26. And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and, David and his men, on that side of the mountain,wherefore David became hurried, to get away from the presence of Saul, but, Saul and his men, were surrounding David and his men, to capture then:

27. when, a messenger, came unto Saul, saying,Haste thee and come! for the Philistines have spread over the land.

28. Then returned Saul from pursuing David, and departed to meet the Philistines,for which cause, they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth  "the Cliff of Separation" .

29. And David went up from thence,and abode in the strongholds of En-gedi.

## 1 Samuel 24

1. And it came to pass, when Saul had returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying: Lo! David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.

2. Then Saul took three thousand chosen men, out of all Israel,and went to seek David and his men, over the face of the rocks of the mountain-goats.

3. And he came into the sheep-folds by the way, there, being a cave, which Saul entered, to cover his feet,David and his men, in the hinder part of the cave, having taken up their abode.

4. So Davids men said unto himLo! the day of which Yahweh said unto theeLo! I am about to deliver up thine enemy, into thy hand: therefore shall thou do unto him, as shall be good in thine eyes. And David arose, and cut off the corner of the robe which belonged to Saul, by stealth.

5. And it came to pass afterwards that Davids heart smote him,because he had cut off the corner   which belonged to Saul.

6. And he said unto his menFar be it from me, of Yahweh, that I should do this thing unto my lord, unto the Anointed of Yahweh, to thrust forth my hand against him,for, the Anointed of Yahweh, is he!

7. So David did chide his men with the words, and did not suffer them to rise up against Saul. And, Saul, rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.

8. Then David rose up, afterwards, and went forth out of the cave, and cried out after Saul, sayingMy lord, O king! And, when Saul looked about behind him, David inclined his face to the earth, and bowed himself down.

9. Then said David to Saul, Wherefore shouldst thou hearken unto the words of the sons of earth, saying,Lo! David is seeking thy hurt?

10. Lo! this day, have thine own eyes seen, how Yahweh had delivered thee up, to-day, into my hand in the cave, and, when one bade me slay thee, I looked with compassion upon thee,and I saidI will not thrust forth my hand against my lord, for, the Anointed of Yahweh, is he!

11. But, my father, see, yea, see, the corner of thy robe in my hand,for, in that I cut off the corner of thy robe, and yet did not slay thee, know thou, and see, that there is not in my hand either wrong or transgression, neither have I sinned against thee, yet art thou hunting my life, to take it.

12. Let Yahweh do justice betwixt me and thee, and let Yahweh avenge me of thee,but, mine own hand, shall not be upon thee.

13. As saith the proverb of the ancients, From the lawless, proceedeth lawlessness,mine own hand, therefore shall not be upon thee.

14. After whom, hath the king of Israel come forth? After whom, art thou in pursuit? After a dead dog! after a single flea!

15. Therefore shall, Yahweh, become, judge, and do justice betwixt me and thee,that he may see, and plead my cause, and justly deliver me out of thy hand.

16. And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Thy voice, is this, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.

17. And he said unto David, More righteous, art thou than I, for, thou, hast requited me, good, but, I, have requited thee, evil.

18. Thou, then, hast told to-day, how thou hast dealt with me, for good,how, when Yahweh had surrendered me into thy hand, thou didst not slay me.

19. Yet, when a man findeth his enemy, will he let him get easily away? Yahweh, then, give thee, good, reward for what, this day, thou hast done unto me.

20. Now, therefore, lo! I know that thou, shalt indeed become king,and that the kingdom of Israel, shall be established in thy hand.

21. Now, therefore, swear unto me by Yahweh, that thou wilt not eat off my seed, after me,and wilt not destroy my name out of the house my father.

22. So David sware unto Saul,and Saul departed unto his own house, but, David and his men, went up on the stronghold.

## 1 Samuel 25

1. And Samuel died, and all Israel were gathered together, and made lamentation for him, and buried him within his own house, in Ramah,and David arose and went down into the wilderness of Maon.

2. Now there was, a man, in Maon, whose cattle were in Carmel, and, the man, was exceeding great, and, he, had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats,and so it was, that he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.

3. Now, the name of the man, was Nabal, and, the name of his wife, Abigail,and, the woman, was of good understanding, and of beautiful figure,but, the man, was unfeeling and of evil practices, and he was a Calebite.

4. So then David heard in the wilderness,that Nabal was shearing his sheep.

5. David, therefore, sent ten young men,and David said unto the young men,Go up to Carmel, and enter in unto Nabal, and ye shall ask him, in my name, of his welfare;

6. and say thusLong life to thee! Mayest, thou, prosper, And, thy household, prosper, And, all that thou hast, prosper!

7. Now, therefore, have I heard that thou hast shearers,Well, the shepherds that thou hast, have been with us, we reproached them not, neither missed they, anything, all the days they were in Carmel.

8. Ask thy young men, that they may tell thee, that so my young men may find favour in thine eyes, for, on a good day, have we come! Give, I pray thee, what thy hand findeth, to thy servants, and to thy son, to David!

9. So Davids young men came, and spake unto Nabal, according to all these words, in the name of David,and waited.

10. Then Nabal answered the servants of David, and said, Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? Nowadays, many are the servants that have broken away, every one from the presence of his lord:

11. Shall I, then, take my bread, and my wine, and my slain beasts, that I have slaughtered for my shearers,and give unto men of whom I know not whence they are?

12. So the young men of David turned away for their journey,and came back, and drew near, and told him, according to all these words.

13. Then said David unto his menGird on you every man his sword. And they girded on them, every man his sword, and, David also, girded on his sword,and there went up after Davidabout four hundred men, and, two hundred, abode by the stores.

14. But a certain one of her young men told, Abigail, Nabals wife, saying,Lo! David sent messengers out of the wilderness to bless our lord, and he treated them with contempt.

15. But, the men, were exceeding good to us,and we were not harmed, neither missed we, anything, all the days we went to and fro with them, while we were in the fields:

16. A wall, became they unto us, both by night and by day, all the days we were with them, tending the flock.

17. Now, therefore, know thou, and see, what thou canst do, for mischief is determined against our lord, and against all his household,but, he, is such an abandoned man, that one cannot speak unto him.

18. Then Abigail hastenedand took two hundred loaves, and two skins of wine, and five sheep made ready, and five measures of parched corn, and a hundred cakes of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs,and put them on the asses.

19. And she said to her young menPass on before me, behold me coming after you; but, to her husband, Nabal, told she nothing.

20. And so it was, as she was riding on her ass, and descending within the covert of the hill, lo! David and his men, descending over against her,so she met them.

21. Now, David, had saidSurely, in vain, did I guard all that pertained to this man in the wilderness, so that there was, nothing, missed of all that he had,seeing he hath returned to me evil for good.

22. So may God do to David and so may he add, if I leave remaining, of all that he hath, until the morning,so much as a little boy.

23. And, when Abigail saw David, she hastened, and alighted from off her ass,and fell down before David upon her face, and prostrated herself on the ground;

24. yea she fell at his feet, and saidOn me, even me, my lord, be the transgression,But, I pray thee, let thy handmaid speak in thine ears, and hear thou the words of thy handmaid.

25. Let it not be, I pray thee, that my lord regard this abandoned manNabal; For, as his name is, so, is he. Nabal, is his name, and, baseness, is with him,But, I, thy handmaid, saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send. \fs15

26. Now, therefore, my lordBy the life of Yahweh, and by the life of thine own soul,seeing Yahweh hath withholden thee from coming in with bloodshed, and from saving thyself, with thine own hand, now, therefore, like Nabal, be thine enemies, and they who are making search for my lord, wrongfully.

27. Now, therefore, this blessing which thy maid-servant hath brought to my lord, let it even be given unto the young men who are going to and fro at the feet of my lord.

28. Forgive, I pray thee, the trespass of thy handmaid,for Yahweh, will certainly make, for my lord an assured house, for, the battles of Yahweh, is my lord fighting, and, wrong, shall not be found in thee, all thy days;

29. yea, though there hath arisen a sun of earth to pursue thee, and to seek thy life, yet shall the life of my lord be bound up in the bundle of the living, with Yahweh thy God, but, as for the life of thine enemies, he shall sling it out with the middle of the hollow of the sling.

30. And it shall be, when Yahweh shall do for my lord, according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee,and shall put thee in charge as leader over Israel,

31. then shall this not become to thee a staggering and stumbling of heart, unto my lordthat thou didst either shed blood without need, or that the hand of my lord saved himself. And, when Yahweh hath dealt well with my lord, then remember thou thy handmaid.

32. Then said David unto Abigail,Blessed, be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who hath sent thee this day, to meet me;

33. and, blessed, be thy discreet judgment, and, blessed, be thou thyself,who hast kept me, this day, from coming in with bloodshed, and from saving myself, with mine own hand.

34. Nevertheless, by the life of Yahweh, God of Israel, who hath restrained me from harming, thee, surely, except thou hadst hastened and come to meet me, there had not been left unto Nabal, by the light of the morning, so much as a little boy.

35. So David received at her hand, that which she had brought him,and, unto herself, he saidGo up, in peace, unto thy house, see! I have hearkened unto thy voice, and accepted thy person.

36. And, when Abigail came unto Nabal, lo! he, had a banquet in his house, like the banquet of a king, and, the heart of Nabal, was glad accordingly, he having drunk deeply,so she told him nothingless or more, until the light of the morning.

37. And it came to pass, in the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, and his wife told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became like a stone.

38. And it came to pass, in about ten days, that Yahweh smote Nabal, that he died.

39. And, when David heard that Nabal was dead, he saidBlessed, be Yahweh, who hath maintained the plea of my reproach, at the hand of Nabal, and hath restrained, his servant, from wrong, yea, the wrong of Nabal, hath Yahweh turned back on his own head. Then sent David, and spake with Abigail, to take her to himself wife.

40. And the servants of David came unto Abigail the Carmelitess,and spake unto her, saying, David, hath sent us unto thee, to take thee to himself to wife.

41. And she arose, and bowed herself down with her face to the earth,and saidLo! thy handmaid, as serving-woman to bathe the feet of the servants of my lord.

42. And Abigail hastened, and mounted, and rode upon her ass, with her five damsels that used to journey at her feet,and she went her way after the messengers of David, and became his wife.

43. David took, Ahinoam also, out of Jezreel,and, they two, became his wives.

44. Saul, indeed, had given his daughter Michal, Davids wife,to Palti, sun of Laish, who was of Gallim.

## 1 Samuel 26

1. And the Ziphites came unto Saul in Gibeah, saying,Is not David hiding himself in the hill of Hachilah, overlooking Jeshimon?

2. Then Saul arose, and went down into the wilderness of Ziph, and, with him, three thousand chosen men of Israel,to seek David in the wilderness of Zip.

3. And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which overlooketh Jeshimon, by the way,but, David, was staying in the wilderness, so he saw that Saul was coming after him into the wilderness.

4. David therefore sent runners,and took knowledge that Saul had come, for a certainty.

5. So then David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped, and David saw the place where Saul was lying, with Abner, son of Ner, prince of his host,and, Saul, was lying within the circular trench, with, the people, encamped round about him.

6. And David responded, and said unto Ahimelech the Hittite, and unto Abishai son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, saying, Who will go down with me unto Saul, within the camp? And Abishai said, I, will go down with thee.

7. So David came, with Abishai, unto the people by night, and lo! Saul lying asleep, within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground, at his head,and Abner and the people lying round about him.

8. Then said Abishai unto David, God hath surrendered, to-day, thine enemy, into thy hand: Now, therefore, let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear to the earth, at one stroke, I, will not do it twice.

9. But David said unto Abishai, Do not destroy him,for who that hath thrust forth his hand against the Anointed of Yahweh, shall be guiltless?

10. And David saidBy the life of Yahweh, surely, Yahweh himself, must smite him,or, his day, must come that he die, or, into battle, must he go down, and be swept away.

11. Far be it from me, of Yahweh, that I should thrust forth my hand against the anointed of Yahweh! Now, therefore, take, I pray thee, the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water, and let us go our way.

12. So David took the spear, and the cruse of water, from near the head of Saul, and they went their way,and no man saw, and no man knew, and no man awoke, for all of them were sleeping, for, a deep sleep from Yahweh, had fallen upon them.

13. Then David crossed over to the other side, and took his stand on the top of the mountain, afar off,a great space, being between them.

14. And David cried aloud unto the people, and unto Abner son of Ner, saying, Wilt thou not answer, Abner? Then answered Abner, and said, Who art thou, that hast cried aloud unto the king?

15. And David said unto AbnerArt not thou, a man? Who indeed is like thee, in Israel? Wherefore, then, hast thou not kept watch over thy lord, the king? For one of the people hath entered, to destroy the kingthy lord.

16. Not good, is this thing which thou hast done, by the life of Yahweh, verily, worthy of death, ye are, in that ye have not kept watch over your lord, over, the Anointed of Yahweh. Now, therefore, see where the spear of the king is, and the cruse of water, that was at his head?

17. And Saul knew the voice of David, and saidThy voice, is this, my son David? And David said, My voice, my lord O king!

18. And he said, Wherefore is it, that my lord is in pursuit of his servant? For what have I done? or what is in my hand that is wrong?

19. Now, therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant,If, Yahweh, have goaded thee on against me, let him accept the sweet smell of a gift, but, if the sons of men, accursed, they are before Yahweh, for they have driven me out, to-day, from joining myself with the inheritance of Yahweh, sayingGo, serve other gods!

20. Now, therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth, away from the presence of Yahweh,for the king of Israel hath come out to hunt for a single flea, as when one pursueth a partridge among the mountains.

21. Then said SaulI have sinned, Return, my son David, for I will harm thee no more, because my life was precious in thine eyes, this day,lo! I have acted foolishly and, greatly, erred.

22. And David responded, and said, Lo! the spear of the king! Let, therefore, one of the young men come over, and fetch it.

23. And let, Yahweh, give back to each man, his righteousness, and his faithfulness,in that Yahweh delivered thee, to-day, into my hand, but I would not thrust forth my hand against the Anointed of Yahweh.

24. Lo! then, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so, let my life be much set by in the eyes of Yahweh, and let him rescue me out of all tribulation.

25. Then said Saul unto DavidBlessed, be thou, my son David, thou shalt both, do, and shalt, prevail. And David went on his way, but, Saul, returned unto his own place.

## 1 Samuel 27

1. And David said, unto his own heart, Now, shall I be swept off, in a single day, by the hand of Saul,there is nothing for me better than that I, escape, into the land of the Philistines, so shall Saul give up seeking for me any more, in any of the bounds of Israel, so shall I escape out of his hand.

2. And David arose, and he and the six hundred men that were with him passed over, unto Achish son of Maoch, king of Gath.

3. And David abode with Achish in Gath, he and his men, each man with his household,David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail wife of Nabal, the Carmelite.

4. And, when it was told Saul, that David had fled to Gath, he added no more, to seek him.

5. Then said David unto AchishIf, I pray thee, I have found favour in thine eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there,for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city, with thee?

6. So Achish gave him, on that day, Ziklag,wherefore Ziklag hath pertained unto the kings of Judah, unto this day.

7. And the number of the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines became a year and four months.

8. And David and his men went up, and made a raid against the Geshurites and the Gizrites and the Amalekites,for, they, were the inhabitants of the land who had been from age-past times, as thou enterest Shur, even as far as the land of Egypt.

9. Now, when David would smite a land, he used to save alive neither man nor woman,but took sheep and oxen, and asses and camels, and apparel, and returned, and came in unto Achish.

10. Then said Achish, Whither have ye made a raid, to-day? And David saidAgainst the South of Judah, or against the South of the Jerahmeelites, or as far as the South of the Kenites.

11. But, neither man nor woman, used David to save alive, to bring into Gath, for he said, Lest they tell of us, saying,So, hath David done, and, such, his manner, all the days that he hath dwelt in the country of the Philistines.

12. And Achish believed in David, saying,He hath made himself, odious, unto his own people, unto Israel, therefore shall he be my servant all his life long.

## 1 Samuel 28

1. And it came to pass, in those days, when the Philistines gathered together their hosts for war, to fight with Israel, that Achish said unto David, Thou must, know, that, with me, shalt thou go forth in the host, thou and thy men.

2. And David said unto Achish, Therefore, now, shalt thou know what thy servant can do. And Achish said unto David, Therefore, keeper of my head, will I appoint thee, all the days.

3. Now, Samuel, was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city,Saul, moreover had put away them who had familiar spirits and them who were oracles, out of the land.

4. So then the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came in, and encamped in Shunem,and Saul gathered together all Israel, and they encamped in Gilboa.

5. And, when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled exceedingly.

6. Then Saul enquired of Yahweh, but Yahweh answered him not,neither by Dreams, nor by the Lights, nor by prophets.

7. Then said Saul unto his servantsSeek me out a woman that owneth a familiar spirit, that I may even go unto her, and enquire of her. And his servants said unto him, Lo! there is a woman that owneth a familiar spirit in En-dor.

8. Saul therefore disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and departedhe and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night,and he saidDivine for me, I pray thee, by the familiar spirit, and bring up for mewhomsoever I shall name unto thee.

9. And the woman said unto himLo! thou, knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off them who have familiar spirits and him who is an oracle, out of the land,wherefore, then, art thou striking at my life, to put me to death?

10. So then Saul sware unto her by Yahweh, saying,By the life of Yahweh, there shall no punishment befall thee for this thing.

11. Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up for thee? And he said, Samuel, bring thou up for me.

12. And, when the woman saw Samuel, she made outcry with a loud voice,and the woman spake unto Saul, sayingWherefore hast thou deceived me, thou thyself being Saul?

13. And the king said unto herBe not afraid, but what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, A god, saw I, coming up out of the earth.

14. And he said to herWhat was his form? And she saidAn old man, coming up, he being wrapped about with a robe. Then Saul knew, that it was, Samuel, so he inclined his face to the earth, and bowed himself down.

15. And Samuel said unto Saul, Wherefore hast thou disquieted me, by bringing me up? And Saul saidI am in sore distress, for, the Philistines, are making war against me, and, God, hath turned away from me, and answereth me no moreeither by means of the prophets, or by dreams, therefore have I even called for thee, to let me know, what I am to do.

16. Then said Samuel, Wherefore, then, shouldst thou ask me,when, Yahweh, hath turned away from thee, and hath come to be with thy neighbour?

17. Therefore hath Yahweh done for him, as he spake by me,yea Yahweh hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to a neighbour of thineto David.

18. As thou didst not hearken unto the voice of Yahweh, neither didst execute the glow of his anger upon Amalek, therefore, this thing, hath Yahweh done unto thee this day;

19. that Yahweh may deliver, Israel also, with thee, into the hand of the Philistines, and, to-morrow, thou and thy sons with thee are about to fall,the host of Israel also, will Yahweh deliver, into the hand of the Philistines.

20. Then Saul hastened, and fell prostratethe whole length of himto the earth, and was sore afraid, at the words of Samuel, and indeed, no, strength, was left in him, for he had not eaten food all the day and all the night.

21. And the woman came unto Saul, and, when she saw that he was greatly terrified, she said unto himLo! thy handmaid hearkened unto thy voice, and I put my life into my hand, and heard thy words which thou didst speak unto me.

22. Now, therefore, I pray thee, hearken, thou also, unto the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set before thee a morsel of food, and eat thou,that there may be in thee strength, when thou goest on thy journey.

23. But he refused, and saidI will not eat. But, when his servants, and the woman also, strongly urged him, then hearkened he unto their voice,and rose up from the earth, and sat on the bed.

24. Now, the woman, had a calf fattening, in the shed. So she hastened, and sacrificed it,and took meal, and kneaded, and baked thereof, unleavened cakes;

25. and brought near before Saul and before his servants, and they did eat. Then rose they up and departed, the same night.

## 1 Samuel 29

1. Now the Philistines gathered together all their hosts, towards Aphek,and, the Israelites, were encamping by the fountain, that is in Jezreel.

2. And, the lords of the Philistines, were passing on by hundreds, and by thousands,but, David and his men, were passing on in the rear, with Achish.

3. Then said the princes of the Philistines, What are these Hebrews   ? And Achish said unto the princes of the PhilistinesIs not this David, servant of Saul king of Israel, who hath been with me this year, or two, and I have found in him nothing, from the day of his coming over unto me unto this day?

4. But the princes of the Philistines raged against him, and the princes of the Philistines said unto himLet the man go back, that he may return unto the place which thou didst appoint him, and let him not go down with us, into battle, so shall he not become to us a traitor, in the battle,for, wherewith, should this fellow gain favour with his lord? Would it not be with the heads of those men?

5. Is not this David, of whom they made responses in the dances, saying,Saul, hath smitten, his thousands, But, David, his, tens of thousands?

6. So Achish called for David, and said unto himBy the life of Yahweh, surely, upright, thou art, and, pleasing in mine eyes, have been thy going out and thy coming in with me, in the host, for I have found in thee no wrong, from the day of thy coming in unto me, until this day,but, in the eyes of the lords, displeasing, thou art.

7. Now, therefore, return, and go in peace,so shalt thou not do wrong in the eyes of the lords of the Philistines.

8. Then said David unto AchishBut what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant, from the day that I came before thee, unto this day,that I may not go in and fight, with the enemies of my lord the king.

9. Then answered Achish, and said unto David, I acknowledge that, pleasing, thou art in mine eyes, as a messenger of God,notwithstanding, the princes of the Philistines, have said, He shall not go up with us, into the battle.

10. Now, therefore, rise up early in the morning, thou and the servants of thy lord who have come with thee,yea, as soon as ye have risen early in the morning, and have light, then depart.

11. So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines,but, the Philistines, went up to Jezreel.

## 1 Samuel 30

1. And it came to pass, when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, that, the Amalekites, had made a raid into the South, and into Ziklag, and had smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;

2. and had taken captive the women and all who were therein, from small even unto great, they had not put one to death,but had driven them forth, and gone their way.

3. So, when David and his men came to the city, lo! it was burnt with fire,and, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, had been taken captive.

4. Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice, and wept,until they had no more strength to weep.

5. And, the two wives of David, had been taken captive,Ahinoam, the Jezreelitess, and Abigail, wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

6. And David was in sore distress, for the people had spoken of stoning him, because the souls of all the people were embittered, every man for his own sons and for his own daughters,but David emboldened himself in Yahweh his God.

7. Then said David to Abiathar the priest, son of Ahimelech, Do bring near me, I pray thee, the ephod. So Abiathar brought near the ephod, unto David.

8. And David enquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I pursue this troop? shall I overtake it? And he said unto him: Pursue, for thou shalt, overtake, and thou shalt, rescue.

9. So David went, he, and the six hundred men, who were with him, and they came in as far as the ravine of Besor,where, they who had to be left behind, stayed.

10. But David pursued, he. and four hundred men,but the two hundred men stayed, because they were too wearied to cross over the ravine of Besor.

11. And they found an Egyptian in the field, and took him unto David,and gave him food, and he did eat, and they gave him water to drink;

12. and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two cakes of raisins, and, when he had eaten, his spirit came back unto him,for he had neither eaten food, nor drunk water, three days and three nights.

13. Then David said to himWhose art thou? and whence art thou? And he said, A young man of Egypt, am I, servant to an Amalekite, and my lord left me behind, because I fell sick, three days ago.

14. As for us, we invaded the South of the Cherithites, and against that which pertaineth unto Judah, and against the South of Caleb,and, Ziklag, burned we with fire.

15. And David said unto him, Wilt thou bring me down unto this troop? And he saidSwear unto me by God, that thou wilt not put me to death, neither wilt thou surrender me into the hand of my lord, and I will bring thee down unto this troop.

16. So he brought him down, and lo! they were left to themselves over the face of all the land,eating, and drinking, and dancing around, for all the great spoil which they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.

17. And David smote them, from the closing twilight even unto the evening of the next day,and there escaped not of them a man, save four hundred young men who rode upon camels, and fled.

18. And David rescued all whom the Amalekites had taken,his two wives also, did David rescue;

19. and there was nothing missing to themwhether small or great, whether spoil, or sons or daughters, or, any thing which they had taken unto themselves,the whole, did David recover.

20. And David took all the flocks and the herds,they drave them before those other cattle, and they said, This, is Davids spoil.

21. And David came unto the two hundred men, who had been too wearied to follow David, and whom they had suffered to remain at the ravine of Besor,and they came forth to meet David, and to meet the people who were with him, and when David came near unto the people, they enquired of his success.

22. Then responded every man who was bad and abandoned, from among the men who had been with David, and saidBecause they went not with me there shall not be given them of the spoil that we have rescued,save, to every man, his wife and his children, let them put them forth, then, and go.

23. Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren,with that which Yahweh hath given to us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.

24. Who indeed, could hearken unto you, in this mutter? Surely, like the share of him that went down into the battle, even, so, shall be the share of him that remained by the storesalike, shall they share.

25. And so it came to pass, from that day forward, that he appointed it, for a statute and for a custom unto Israel, until this day.

26. And, when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil, unto the elders of Judah, unto his friends, saying,Lo! for you, a blessing, out of the spoil of the enemies of Yahweh:

27. to them who were in Bethel, and to them who were in Ramoth of the South, and to them who were in Jattir,

28. and to them who were in Aroer, and to them who were in Siphmoth, and to them who were in Eshtemoa,

29. and to them who were in Racal, and to them who were in the cities of the Jerameelites, and to them who were in the cities of the Kenites,

30. and to them who were in Hormah, and to them who were in Cor-ashan, and to them who were in Athach,

31. and to them who were in Hebron,and to all the places where David had been to and fro, he and his men.

## 1 Samuel 31

1. Now, as, the Philistines, were fighting against Israel, the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell slain, in Mount Gilboa.

2. And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons,and the Philistines smote Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchishua, sons of Saul.

3. And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers discovered him,and he was terrified at the archers.

4. Then said Saul to his armour-bearerDraw thy sword and pierce me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come, and pierce me through, and abuse me. But his armour-bearer was not willing, for he was sore afraid. So Saul took his sword and fell thereon.

5. And, when his armour-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also, fell upon his sword, and died with him.

6. Thus died Saul, and his three sons, and his armour-bearer, yea all his men, on that day, together.

7. And, when the men of Israel who were across the vale, and who were across the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel had fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled, and the Philistines entered, and took up their abode therein.

8. And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul, and his three sons, lying prostrate in Mount Gilboa.

9. So they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour,and sent throughout the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and unto the people.

10. And they put his armour in a house of Ashtoreths,and, his dead body, fastened they on the wall of Beth-shan.

11. And, when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard concerning him, what the Philistines had done unto Saul,

12. then arose all the men of valour, and journeyed all the night, and took the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, from the wall of Beth-shan,and came to Jabesh, and burned them there;

13. and took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk-tree in Jabesh,and fasted seven days.
