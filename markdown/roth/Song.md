__Therefore remove thou vexation from thy heart, and put away discomfort from thy flesh,for, youth and dawn, are vanity!__

1. The Song of Songs, which pertaineth to Solomon.

2.  SHE  Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!  THEY  For better are thy caresses than wine:

3. Like the fragrance of thy precious oils, Oil poured out, is thy name, For this cause, virgins love thee.

4.  SHE  Draw me!  THEY  After thee, will we run!  SHE  The king, hath brought me, into his chambers.  THEY  We will exult and rejoice in thee, we will mention thy caresses, beyond wine, Sincerely they love thee.

5.  SHE  Swarthy, I am but comely, ye daughters of Jerusalem.  THEY  Like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.

6.  SHE  Do not look on me, because, I, am so swarthy, because the sun hath scorched me,My mothers sons, were angry with me, they set me to keep the vineyards, Mine own vineyard, have I not kept.

7. Tell me, thou loved of my soul! Where wilt thou pasture thy flock? Where wilt thou let them recline at noon? For why should I be as one that wrappeth a veil about her, by the flocks of thy companions?

8.  HE  If thou know not of thyself, most beautiful among women! get thee forth in the footsteps of the flock, and pasture thy kids by the huts of the shepherds.

9. To a mare of mine, in the chariots of Pharaoh, have I likened thee, my fair one!

10. Comely are thy cheeks, with bead-rows, thy neck, with strings of gems.

11.  THEY  Rows of golden ornaments, will we make thee, with studs of silver.

12.  SHE  By the time the king is in his circle, my nard, will have given out its fragrance:

13. A bag of myrrh, is my beloved to me, between my breasts, shall it tarry the night!

14. A cluster of henna, is my beloved to me, in the vineyards of En-gedi.

15.  HE  Lo! thou art beautiful my fair one, lo! thou art beautiful, Thine eyes,   doves!

16.  SHE  Lo! thou art beautiful, my beloved, Yea delightful!  BOTH  Yea! our couch, is covered with leaves:

17. The beams of our house, are cedars, Our fretted ceiling, is cypress-trees.

## Song of Songs 2

1.  SHE  I am The meadow-saffron of Sharon, The lily of the valleys.

2.  HE  As a lily among thorns, So, is my fair one, among the daughters!

3.  SHE  As an apple-tree among the trees of the forest, So, is my beloved, among the sons: In his shade, I greatly delighted and sat down, And, his fruit, was sweet to my taste.

4. He hath brought me into the house of wine, and, his banner over me, is love.

5. Sustain me with raisin-cakes, refresh me with apples,for sick with love, I am.

6. His left hand under my head, then, his right hand, embraceth me!

7.  HE  I adjure you, ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or by the hinds of the field,That ye wake not, nor arouse, the dear love until she please!  ****

8.  SHE  The voice of my beloved! Lo! here he cometh,leaping over the mountains, skipping over the hills.

9. Resembleth, my beloved, a gazelle, or a young stag,Lo! here he is, standing behind our wall, looking in at the windows, peeping in at the lattice.

10. Responded my beloved, and said to me,Rise up! my fairmy beautifulone, and come away,

11. For lo, the winter, is past,the rain, is over,   gone;

12. The flowers, have appeared in the earth, the time of the spring-song, hath come,and, the voice of the turtle, is heard in our land;

13. The fig-tree, hath spiced her green figs, and, the vinesall blossom, yield fragrance,Rise up! my fairmy beautifulone, and come away!

14.  HE  O my dove! In the retreats of the crag, in the hiding-place of the terrace, Let me see thy form, Let me hear thy voice,For, thy voice, is sweet, and, thy form, comely.

15.  BOTH  Take ye for us, the foxes, the little foxes that are spoiling the vines,and, our vines, are all blossom!

16.  SHE  My beloved, is, mine, and, I, am, his, he that pastureth among lilies!

17. Until the day, breathe, and the shadows, be lengthened, Again, liken thyself, my beloved, to a gazelle, or to a young stag, upon the cleft mountains.  ****

## Song of Songs 3

1.  SHE  Upon my couch, in the night-time, sought I the beloved of my soul,I sought him, but found him not.

2. Come! I must arise, and go about in the city, In the paths and in the broadways, I must seek the beloved of my soul,I sought him, but found him not.

3. The watchmen that go round in the city, found me, The beloved of my soul, have ye seen?

4. Scarcely had I passed from them, when I found the beloved of my soul,I caught him, and would not let him go, until that I had brought him into the house of my mother, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.

5.  HE  I adjure you ye, daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles, or by the hinds of the field,That ye wake not, nor arouse, the dear love until she please.  ****

6.  THEY  Who is this, coming up out of the wilderness, like pillars of smoke,with perfume of myrrh, and frankincense, besides all the aromatic powder of the merchant?

7. Lo! his couch, tis Solomons own, Threescore heroes, around it,of the heroes of Israel:

8. All of them, grasping the sword, trained for war,every man, with his sword upon his thigh, because of dread, in the night-time.

9. A palanquin, King Solomon made himself, of the trees of Lebanon:

10. The supports thereof, made he of silver, the couch thereof, of gold, the seat thereof, of purple,the midst thereof, hath an inlay of love from the daughters of Jerusalem.

11. Go forth and gaze, ye daughters of Zion, upon King Solomon,wearing the crown, wherewith his mother, crowned him, in the day of his marriage, and in the day of his heart gladness.

11. His head, is pure gold,his locks, are bushy, black as a raven;

12. His eyes, like doves, by the channels of water,bathing in milk, set as gems in a ring:

13. His cheeks, like a raised bed of balsam, growing plants of perfume,His lips, lilies, dripping with myrrh distilling:

14. His hands, cylinders of gold, set with topaz,His body, wrought work of ivory, covered with sapphires:

3. Thy two breasts, are like two young roes, the twins of a gazelle:

8. I said, I will ascend the palm-tree, I will lay hold of its fruit stalksOh then, let thy breasts, I pray thee, be like vine-clusters, And, the fragrance of thy nose, like apples;

6.  SHE  Set me as a seal, upon thy heart, as a seal upon thine arm, For, mighty as death, is love, Exacting as hades, is jealousy,The flames thereof, are flames of fire, The flash of Yah!

7. Many waters, cannot quench love, nor shall, floods, overwhelm it,If a man would give all the substance of his house, for love, they would, utterly despise, him.  ****

8.  THEY  A sister, have we, a little one, and, breasts, hath she none, What shall we do for our sister, in the day when she may be spoken for?

10.  SHE  I, was a wall, and, my breasts, like towers,Then, became I, in his eyes, one who did indeed find good content.

12. Mine own vineyard, is before me,The thousand belong to thee, O Solomon, and two hundred to the keepers of the fruit thereof.

13.  HE  O thou fair dweller in the gardens, the companions are giving heed to thy voice, Let me hear it.

14.  SHE  Come quickly, my beloved, and resemble thou a gazelle, or a young stag, upon the mountains of balsam-trees.
