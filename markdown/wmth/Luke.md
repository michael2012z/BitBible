# Luke

## Luke 1

1. Seeing that many have attempted to draw up a narrative of the facts which are received with full assurance among us

2. on the authority of those who were from the beginning eye-witnesses and were devoted to the service of the divine Message,

3. it has seemed right to me also, after careful investigation of the facts from their commencement, to write for you, most noble Theophilus, a connected account,

4. that you may fully know the truth of the things which you have been taught by word of mouth.

5. There was in the time of Herod, the king of Judaea, a priest of the name of Zechariah, belonging to the class of Abijah. He had a wife who was a descendant of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.

6. They were both of them upright before God, blamelessly obeying all the Lord's precepts and ordinances.

7. But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren; and both of them were far advanced in life.

8. Now while he was doing priestly duty before God in the prescribed course of his class,

9. it fell to his lot –according to the custom of the priesthood– to go into the Sanctuary of the Lord and burn the incense;

10. and the whole multitude of the people were outside praying, at the hour of incense.

11. Then there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense;

12. and Zechariah on seeing him was agitated and terrified.

13. But the angel said to him, »Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your petition has been heard: and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call his name John.

14. Gladness and exultant joy shall be yours, and many will rejoice over his birth.

15. For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; no wine or fermented drink shall he ever drink; but he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth.

16. Many of the descendants of Israel will he turn to the Lord their God;

17. and he will be His forerunner in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn fathers' hearts to the children, and cause the rebellious to walk in the wisdom of the upright, to make a people perfectly ready for the lord.«

18. »By what proof,« asked Zechariah, »shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is far advanced in years.«

19. »I am Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God,« answered the angel, »and I have been sent to talk with you and tell you this good news.

20. And now you will be dumb and unable to speak until the day when this has taken place; because you did not believe my words–words which will be fulfilled at their appointed time.«

21. Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah, and were surprised that he stayed so long in the Sanctuary.

22. When, however, he came out, he was unable to speak to them; and they knew that he must have seen a vision in the Sanctuary; but he kept making signs to them and continued dumb.

23. When his days of service were at an end, he went to his home;

24. and in course of time his wife Elizabeth conceived, and kept herself secluded five months.

25. »Thus has the Lord dealt with me,« she said, »now that He has graciously taken away my reproach among men.«

26. Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,

27. to a maiden betrothed to a man of the name of Joseph, a descendant of David. The maiden's name was Mary.

28. So Gabriel went into the house and said to her, »Joy be to you, favoured one! the Lord is with you.«

29. She was greatly agitated at his words, and wondered what such a greeting meant.

30. But the angel said, »Do not be frightened, Mary, for you have found favour with God.

31. You will conceive in your womb and bear a son; and you are to call His name JESUS.

32. He will be great and He will be called `Son of the Most High.' And the Lord God will give Him the throne of His forefather David;

33. and He will be King over the House of Jacob for the Ages, and of His Kingdom there will be no end.«

34. »How can this be,« Mary replied, »seeing that I have no husband?«

35. The angel answered, »The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for this reason your holy offspring will be called `the Son of God.'

36. And see, your relative Elizabeth–she also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.

37. For no promise from God will be impossible of fulfilment.«

38. »I am the Lord's maidservant,« Mary replied; »may it be with me in accordance with your words!« And then the angel left her.

39. Not long after this, Mary rose up and went in haste into the hill country to a town in Judah.

40. Here she came to the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth;

41. and as soon as Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the babe leapt within her. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,

42. and uttered a loud cry of joy. »Blest among women are you,« she said, »and the offspring of your body is blest!

43. But why is this honour done me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

44. For, the moment your greeting reached my ears, the babe within me leapt for joy.

45. And blessed is she who has believed, for the word spoken to her from the Lord shall be fulfilled.«

46. Then Mary said: »My soul extols the Lord,

47. And my spirit triumphs in God my Saviour;

48. Because He has not turned from His maidservant in her lowly position; For from this time forward all generations will account me happy,

49. Because the mighty One has done great things for me –Holy is His name!–

50. And His compassion is, generation after generation, Upon those who fear Him.

51. He has manifested His supreme strength. He has scattered those who were haughty in the thoughts of their hearts.

52. He has cast monarchs down from their thrones, And exalted men of low estate.

53. The hungry He has satisfied with choice gifts, But the rich He has sent empty-handed away.

54. His servant Israel He has helped, Remembering His compassion–

55. In fulfillment of His promises to our forefathers–For Abraham and his posterity for ever.«

56. So Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months, and then returned home.

57. Now when Elizabeth's full time was come, she gave birth to a son;

58. and her neighbours and relatives heard how the Lord had had great compassion on her; and they rejoiced with her.

59. And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and were going to call him Zechariah, after his father.

60. His mother, however, said, »No, he is to be called John.«

61. »There is not one of your family,« they said, »who has that name.«

62. They asked his father by signs what he wished him to be called.

63. So he asked for a writing-tablet, and wrote, »His name is John.« And they all wondered.

64. Instantly his mouth and his tongue were set free, and he began to speak and bless God.

65. And all who lived round about them were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judaea reports of all these things were spread abroad.

66. All who heard the story treasured it in their memories. »What then will this child be?« they said. For the lord's hand was indeed with him.

67. And Zechariah his father was filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke in a rapture of praise.

68. »Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,« he said, »Because He has not forgotten His people but has effected redemption for them,

69. And has raised up a mighty Deliverer for us In the house of David His servant–

70. As He has spoken from all time by the lips of His holy Prophets–

71. To deliver us from our foes and from the power of all who hate us.

72. He dealt pitifully with our forefathers, And remembered His holy covenant,

73. The oath which He swore to Abraham our forefather,

74. To grant us to be rescued from the power of our foes And so render worship to Him free from fear,

75. In piety and uprightness before Him all our days.

76. And you moreover, O child, shall be called Prophet of the Most High; For you shall go on in front before the Lord to prepare the way for Him,

77. To give to His People a knowledge of salvation In the forgiveness of their sins,

78. Through the tender compassion of our God, Through which the daybreak from on high will come to us,

79. Dawning on those who now dwell in the darkness and shadow of death–To direct our feet into the path of peace.«

80. And the child grew and became strong in character, and lived in the Desert till the time came for him to appear publicly to Israel.

## Luke 2

1. Just at this time an edict was issued by Caesar Augustus for the registration of the whole Empire.

2. It was the first registration made during the governorship of Quirinius in Syria;

3. and all went to be registered–every one to the town to which he belonged.

4. So Joseph went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judaea, to David's town of Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,

5. to have himself registered together with Mary, who was betrothed to him and was with child.

6. But while they were there, her full time came,

7. and she gave birth to her first-born son, and wrapped Him round, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.

8. Now there were shepherds in the same part of the country, keeping watch over their sheep by night in the open fields,

9. when suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round them; and they were filled with terror.

10. But the angel said to them, »Put away all fear; for I am bringing you good news of great joy–joy for all the People.

11. For a Saviour who is the Anointed Lord is born to you to-day, in the town of David.

12. And this is the token for you: you will find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.«

13. And immediately there was with the angel a multitude of the army of Heaven praising God and saying,

14. »Glory be to God in the highest Heavens, And on earth peace among men who please Him!«

15. Then, as soon as the angels had left them and returned to Heaven, the shepherds said to one another, »Let us now go over as far as Bethlehem and see this that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.«

16. So they made haste and came and found Mary and Joseph, with the babe lying in the manger.

17. And when they saw the child, they told what had been said to them about Him;

18. and all who listened were astonished at what the shepherds told them.

19. But Mary treasured up all these things, often dwelling on them in her mind.

20. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen in accordance with the announcement made to them.

21. When eight days had passed and the time for circumcising Him had come, He was called JESUS, the name given Him by the angel before His conception in the womb.

22. And when the days for their purification appointed by the Law of Moses had passed, they took Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord–

23. as it is written in the Law of the Lord: »Every first-born male shall be called holy to the Lord.«

24. During the passage He fell asleep, and there came down a squall of wind on the Lake, so that the boat began to fill and they were in deadly peril.

25. And they also offered a sacrifice as commanded in the Law of the Lord, »a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons.«

26. Now there was a man in Jerusalem of the name of Symeon, an upright and God-fearing man, who was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.

27. To him it had been revealed by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death until he had seen the Lord's Anointed One.

28. Led by the Spirit he came to the Temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do with regard to Him according to the custom of the Law,

29. he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said,

30. »Now, O Sovereign Lord, Thou dost send Thy servant away in peace, in fulfilment of Thy word,

31. Because mine eyes have seen Thy salvation,

32. Which Thou hast made ready in the sight of all nations–

33. A light to shine upon the Gentiles, And the glory of Thy people Israel.«

34. And while the child's father and mother were wondering at the words of Symeon concerning Him,

35. Symeon blessed them and said to Mary the mother, »This child is appointed for the falling and the uprising of many in Israel and for a token to be spoken against;

36. and a sword will pierce through your own soul also; that the reasonings in many hearts may be revealed.«

37. There was also Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, belonging to the tribe of Asher. She was of a very great age, having had after her maidenhood seven years of married life,

38. and then being a widow of eighty-four years. She was never absent from the Temple, but worshipped, by day and by night, with fasting and prayer.

39. And coming up just at that moment, she gave thanks to God, and spoke about the child to all who were expecting the deliverance of Jerusalem.

40. Then, as soon as they had accomplished all that the Law required, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.

41. And the child grew and became strong and full of wisdom, and the favour of God rested upon Him.

42. Now His parents used to go up year by year to Jerusalem at the Feast of the Passover.

43. And when He was twelve years old they went up as was customary at the time of the Feast, and,

44. after staying the full number of days, when they started back home the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not discover this,

45. but supposing Him to be in the travelling company, they proceeded a day's journey. Then they searched up and down for Him among their relatives and acquaintances;

46. but being unable to find Him they returned to Jerusalem, making anxious inquiry for Him.

47. On the third day they found Him in the Temple sitting among the Rabbis, both listening to them and asking them questions,

48. while all who heard Him were astonished at His intelligence and at the answers He gave.

49. When they saw Him, they were smitten with amazement, and His mother said to Him, »My child, why have you behaved thus to us? Your father and I have been searching for you in anguish.«

50. »Why is it that you have been searching for me?« He replied; »did you not know that it is my duty to be engaged upon my Father's business?«

51. But they did not understand the significance of these words.

52. Then He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was always obedient to them; but His mother carefully treasured up all these incidents in her memory.

53. And as Jesus grew older He gained in both wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.

## Luke 3

1. Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being Governor of Judaea, Herod Tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip Tetrarch of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias Tetrarch of Abilene,

2. during the High-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, a message from God came to John, the son of Zechariah, in the Desert.

3. John went into all the district about the Jordan proclaiming a baptism of the penitent for the forgiveness of sins;

4. as it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah, »The voice of one crying aloud! `In the Desert prepare ye a road for the Lord: make His highway straight.

5. Every ravine shall be filled up, and every mountain and hill levelled down, the crooked places shall be turned into straight roads, and the rugged ways into smooth;

6. and then shall all mankind see God's salvation.'«

7. Accordingly John used to say to the crowds who came out to be baptized by him, `O vipers' brood, who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath?

8. Live lives which shall prove your change of heart; and do not begin to say to yourselves, `We have Abraham as our forefather,' for I tell you that God can raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones.

9. And even now the axe is lying at the root of the trees, so that every tree which fails to yield good fruit will quickly be hewn down and thrown into the fire.«

10. The crowds repeatedly asked him, »What then are we to do?«

11. »Let the man who has two coats,« he answered, »give one to the man who has none; and let the man who has food share it with others.«

12. There came also a party of tax-gatherers to be baptized, and they asked him, »Rabbi, what are we to do?«

13. »Do not exact more than the legal amount,« he replied.

14. The soldiers also once and again inquired of him, »And we, what are we to do?« His answer was, »Neither intimidate any one nor lay false charges; and be content with your pay.«

15. And while the people were in suspense and all were debating in their minds whether John might possibly be the Anointed One,

16. he answered the question by saying to them all, »As for me, I am baptizing you with water, but One mightier than I is coming, whose very sandal-strap I am not worthy to unfasten: He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and with fire.

17. His winnowing-shovel is in His hand to clear out His threshing-floor, and to gather the wheat into His storehouse; but the chaff He will burn up in fire unquenchable.«

18. With many exhortations besides these he declared the Good News to the people.

19. But Herod the Tetrarch, being repeatedly rebuked by him about Herodias his brother's wife, and about all the wicked deeds that he had done,

20. now added this to crown all the rest, that he threw John into prison.

21. Now when all the people had been baptized, and Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the sky opened,

22. and the Holy Spirit came down in bodily shape, like a dove, upon Him, and a voice came from Heaven, which said, »Thou art My Son, dearly loved: in Thee is My delight.«

23. And He –Jesus– when He began His ministry, was about thirty years old. He was the son (it was supposed) of Joseph, son of Heli,

24. son of Matthat, son of Levi, son of Melchi, son of Jannai, son of Joseph,

25. son of Mattathias, son of Amos, son of Nahum, son of Esli, son of Naggai,

26. son of Mahath, son of Mattathias, son of Semein, son of Josech, son of Joda,

27. son of Johanan, son of Resa, son of Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, son of Neri,

28. son of Melchi, son of Addi, son of Cosam, son of Elmadam, son of Er,

29. son of Joshua, son of Eliezar, son of Jorim, son of Maththat, son of Levi,

30. son of Symeon, son of Judah, son of Joseph, son of Jonam, son of Eliakim, son of

31. Melea, son of Menna, son of Mattatha, son of Nathan, son of David,

32. son of Jesse, son of Obed, son of Boaz, son of Salmon, son of Nahshon,

33. son of Amminadab, son of Admin, son of Arni, son of Hezron, son of Perez, son of Judah,

34. son of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham, son of Terah, son of Nahor,

35. son of Serug, son of Reu, son of Peleg, son of Eber, son of Shelah,

36. son of Cainan, son of Arpachshad, son of Shem, son of Noah, son of Lamech,

37. son of Methuselah, son of Enoch, son of Jared, son of Mahalalel, son of Kenan,

38. son of Enosh, son of Seth, son of Adam, son of God.

## Luke 4

1. Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led about by the Spirit in the Desert for forty days,

2. tempted all the while by the Devil. During those days He ate nothing, and at the close of them He suffered from hunger.

3. Then the Devil said to Him, »If you are God's Son, tell this stone to become bread.«

4. »It is written,« replied Jesus, »`It is not on bread alone that a man shall live.'«

5. The Devil next led Him up and caused Him to see at a glance all the kingdoms of the world.

6. And the Devil said to Him, »To you will I give all this authority and this splendour; for it has been handed over to me, and on whomsoever I will I bestow it.

7. If therefore you do homage to me, it shall all be yours.'

8. Jesus answered him, »It is written, `To the Lord thy God thou shalt do homage, and to Him alone shalt thou render worship.'«

9. Then he brought Him to Jerusalem and caused Him to stand on the roof of the Temple, and said to Him, »If you are God's Son, throw yourself down from here; for it is written,

10. `He will give orders to His angels concerning thee, to guard thee safely;'

11. and `On their hands they shall bear thee up, Lest at any moment thou shouldst strike thy foot against a stone.'«

12. The reply of Jesus was, »It is said, `Thou shalt not put the Lord they God to the proof.'«

13. So the Devil, having fully tried every kind of temptation on Him, left Him for a time.

14. Then Jesus returned in the Spirit's power to Galilee; and His fame spread through all the adjacent districts.

15. And He proceeded to teach in their synagogues, winning praise from all.

16. He came to Nazareth also, where He had been brought up; and, as was His custom, He went to the synagogue on the Sabbath, and stood up to read.

17. And there was handed to Him the book of the Prophet Isaiah, and, opening the book, He found the place where it was written,

18. »The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me to proclaim Good News to the poor; He has sent me to announce release to the prisoners of war and recovery of sight to the blind: to send away free those whom tyranny has crushed,

19. to proclaim the year of acceptance with the Lord.«

20. And rolling up the book, He returned it to the attendant, and sat down–to speak. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him.

21. Then He proceeded to say to them, »To-day is this Scripture fulfilled in your hearing.«

22. And they all spoke well of Him, wondering at the sweet words of kindness which fell from His lips, while they asked one another, »Is not this Joseph's son?«

23. »Doubtless,« said He, »you will quote to me the proverb, `Physician, cure yourself: all that we hear that you have done at Capernaum, do here also in your native place.'«

24. »I tell you in solemn truth,« He added, »that no Prophet is welcomed among his own people.

25. But I tell you in truth that there was many a widow in Israel in the time of Elijah, when there was no rain for three years and six months and there came a severe famine over all the land;

26. and yet to not one of them was Elijah sent: he was only sent to a widow at Zarephath in the Sidonian country.

27. And there was also many a leper in Israel in the time of the Prophet Elisha, and yet not one of them was cleansed, but Naaman the Syrian was.«

28. Then all in the synagogue, while listening to these words, were filled with fury.

29. They rose, hurried Him outside the town, and brought Him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, to throw Him down the cliff;

30. but He passed through the midst of them and went His way.

31. So He came down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, where He frequently taught the people on the Sabbath days.

32. And they were greatly impressed by His teaching, because He spoke with the language of authority.

33. But in the synagogue there was a man possessed by the spirit of a foul demon. In a loud voice he cried out,

34. »Ha! Jesus the Nazarene, what have you to do with us? I know who you are–God's Holy One!«

35. But Jesus rebuked the demon. »Silence!« He exclaimed; »come out of him.« Upon this, the demon hurled the man into the midst of them, and came out of him without doing him any harm.

36. All were astonished and awe-struck; and they asked one another, »What sort of language is this? For with authority and real power He gives orders to the foul spirits and they come out.«

37. And the talk about Him spread into every part of the neighbouring country.

38. Now when He rose and left the synagogue He went to Simon's house. Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from an acute attack of fever; and they consulted Him about her.

39. Then standing over her He rebuked the fever, and it left her; and she at once rose and waited on them.

40. At sunset all who had friends suffering from any illness brought them to Him, and He laid His hands on them all, one by one, and cured them.

41. Demons also came out of many, loudly calling out, »You are the Son of God.« But He rebuked them and forbad them to speak, because they knew Him to be the Christ.

42. Next morning, at daybreak, He left the town and went away to a solitary place; but the people flocked out to find Him, and, coming to the place where He was, they endeavoured to detain Him that He might not leave them.

43. But He said to them, »I have to tell the Good News of the Kingdom of God to the other towns also, because for this purpose I was sent.«

44. And for some time He preached in the synagogues in Galilee.

## Luke 5

1. On one occasion the crowd was pressing on Him and listening to God's Message, while He was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret.

2. He, however, saw two fishing-boats drawn up on the beach (for the men had gone away from them and were washing the nets),

3. and going on board one of them, which was Simon's He asked him to push out a little from land. Then He sat down and taught the crowd of people from the boat.

4. When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, »Push out into deep water, and let down your nets for a haul.«

5. »Rabbi,« replied Peter, »all night long we have worked hard and caught nothing; but at your command I will let down the nets.«

6. This they did, and enclosed a vast number of fish; and their nets began to break.

7. So they signalled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them; they came, and they filled both the boats so that they almost sank.

8. When Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at the knees of Jesus, and exclaimed, »Master, leave my boat, for I am a sinful man.«

9. (For he was astonished and terrified –he and all his companions– at the haul of fish which they had taken;

10. and so were Simon's partners James and John, the sons of Zabdi.) But Jesus replied to Simon, »Fear not: from this time you shall be a catcher of men.«

11. Then, after bringing their boats to land, they left everything and followed Him.

12. On another occasion, when He was in one of the towns, there was a man there covered with leprosy, who, seeing Jesus, threw himself at His feet and implored Him, saying, »Sir, if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean.«

13. Reaching out His hand and touching him, Jesus said, »I am willing; be cleansed!« And instantly the leprosy left him.

14. He ordered him to tell no one. »But go,« He said, »show yourself to the Priest, and make the offering for your purification which Moses appointed, as evidence for them.«

15. But all the more the report about Him spread abroad, and great multitudes crowded to hear Him and to be cured of their diseases;

16. but Jesus Himself constantly withdrew into the Desert and there prayed.

17. One day He was teaching, and there were Pharisees and teachers of the Law sitting there who had come from every village in Galilee and Judaea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present for Him to cure people.

18. And a party of men came carrying a palsied man on a bed, and they endeavoured to bring him in and lay him before Jesus.

19. But when they could find no way of doing so because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down through the tiling –bed and all– into the midst, in front of Jesus.

20. He saw their faith and said to him, »Friend, your sins are forgiven.«

21. Then the Scribes and Pharisees began to cavil, asking, »Who is this, uttering blasphemies? Who but God alone can forgive sins?«

22. Well aware of their reasonings, Jesus answered their questions by asking in turn, »What is this that you are debating in your hearts?

23. Which is easier? –to say, `Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, `Rise and walk'?

24. But to prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins« –Turning to the paralytic He said, »I bid you, Rise, take up your bed, and go home.«

25. Instantly he stood up in their presence, took up the mattress on which he had been lying, and went away to his home, giving glory to God.

26. Amazement seized them all. »Glory to God!« was the abiding feeling. Yet fear flashed through their minds and they said, »We have seen strange things to-day.«

27. After this He went out and noticed a tax-gatherer, Levi by name, sitting at the Toll office; and He said to him, »Follow me.«

28. He rose, left everything, and followed Him.

29. Levi also gave a great entertainment at his house in honour of Jesus, and there was a large party of tax-gatherers and others at table with them.

30. This led the Pharisees and Scribes of their party to expostulate with His disciples and ask, »Why are you eating and drinking with these tax-gatherers and notorious sinners?«

31. But Jesus replied to them, »It is not men in good health who require a physician, but the sick.

32. I have not come to call the righteous to repentance, but sinners.«

33. Again they said to Him, »John's disciples fast often and pray, as do also those of the pharisees; but yours eat and drink.«

34. »Can you compel the bridal party to fast,« replied Jesus, »so long as they have the bridegroom among them?

35. But a time for this will come, when the Bridegroom has been taken away from them: then, at that time, they will fast.«

36. He also spoke in figurative language to them. »No one,« He said, »tears a piece from a new garment to mend an old one. Otherwise he would not only spoil the new, but the patch from the new would not match the old.

37. Nor does any one pour new wine into old wine-skins. Otherwise the new wine would burst the skins, the wine itself would be spilt, and the skins be destroyed.

38. But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.

39. Nor does any one after drinking old wine wish for new; for he says, `The old is better.'«

## Luke 6

1. Now on the second-first Sabbath while He was passing through the wheatfields, His disciples were plucking the ears and rubbing them with their hands to eat the grain.

2. And some of the Pharisees asked, »Why are you doing what the Law forbids on the Sabbath?«

3. »Have you never read so much as this,« answered Jesus– »what David did when he and his followers were hungry;

4. how he entered the house of God and took and ate the Presented Loaves and gave some to his followers–loaves which none but the Priests are allowed to eat?«

5. »The Son of Man,« He added, »is Lord of the Sabbath also.«

6. On another Sabbath He had gone to the synagogue and was teaching there; and in the congregation was a man whose right arm was withered.

7. The Scribes and the Pharisees were on the watch to see whether He would cure him on the Sabbath that they might be able to bring an accusation against Him.

8. He knew their thoughts, and said to the man with the withered arm, »Rise, and stand there in the middle.« And he rose and stood there.

9. Then Jesus said to them, »I put it to you all whether we are allowed to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil; to save a life, or to destroy it.«

10. And looking round upon them all He said to the man, »Stretch out your arm.« He did so, and the arm was restored.

11. But they were filled with madness, and began to discuss with one another what they should do to Jesus.

12. About that time He went out on one occasion into the hill country to pray; and He remained all night in prayer to God.

13. When it was day, He called His disciples; and He selected from among them twelve, whom He also named Apostles.

14. These were Simon, to whom also He had given the name of Peter, and Andrew his brother; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew;

15. Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus and Simon called the Zealot;

16. James's relative Judas, and Judas Iscariot who proved to be a traitor.

17. With these He came down till He reached a level place, where there was a great crowd of His disciples, and a multitude of people from every part of Judaea, from Jerusalem, and from the sea-side district of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear Him and to be cured of their diseases;

18. and those who were tormented by foul spirits were cured.

19. The whole crowd were eager to touch Him, because power went forth from him and cured every one.

20. Then fixing His eyes upon His disciples, Jesus said to them, »Blessed are you poor, because the Kingdom of God is yours.

21. »Blessed are you who hunger now, because your hunger shall be satisfied.« Blessed are you who now weep aloud, because you shall laugh.

22. »Blessed are you when men shall hate you and exclude you from their society and insult you, and spurn your very names as evil things, for the Son of Man's sake.«

23. »Be glad at such a time, and dance for joy; for your reward is great in Heaven; for that is just the way their forefathers behaved to the Prophets!«

24. »But alas for you rich men, because you already have your consolation!«

25. »Alas for you who now have plenty to eat, because you will be hungry!« Alas for you who laugh now, because you will mourn and weep aloud!

26. »Alas for you when men shall all have spoken well of you; for that is just the way their forefathers behaved to the false Prophets!«

27. »But to you who are listening to me I say, Love your enemies; seek the welfare of those who hate you;«

28. bless those who curse you; pray for those who revile you.

29. To him who gives you a blow on one side of the face offer the other side also; and to him who is robbing you of your outer garment refuse not the under one also.

30. To every one who asks, give; and from him who takes away your property, do not demand it back.

31. And behave to your fellow men just as you would have them behave to you.

32. »If you love those who love you, what credit is it to you? Why, even bad men love those who love them.«

33. And if you are kind to those who are kind to you, what credit is it to you? Even bad men act thus.

34. And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is it to you? Even bad men lend to their fellows so as to receive back an equal amount.

35. Nevertheless love your enemies, be beneficent; and lend without hoping for any repayment. Then your recompense shall be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for He is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.

36. Be compassionate just as your Father is compassionate.

37. »Judge not, and you shall not be judged; condemn not, and you shall not be condemned; pardon, and you shall be pardoned;«

38. give, and gifts shall be bestowed on you. Full measure, pressed, shaken down, and running over, shall they pour into your laps; for with the same measure that you use they shall measure to you in return.«

39. He also spoke to them in figurative language. »Can a blind man lead a blind man?« He asked; »would not both fall into the ditch?

40. There is no disciple who is superior to his teacher; but every one whose instruction is complete will be like his teacher.

41. »And why look at the splinter in your brother's eye instead of giving careful attention to the beam in your own?«

42. How can you say to your brother, `Brother, let me take that splinter out of your eye,' when all the while you yourself do not see the beam in your own eye? Vain pretender! take the beam out of your own eye first, and then you will see clearly to take the splinter out of your brother's eye.

43. »There is no good tree that yields unsound fruit, nor again any unsound tree that yields good fruit.«

44. Every tree is known by its own fruit. It is not from thorns that men gather figs, nor from the bramble that they can get a bunch of grapes.

45. A good man from the good stored up in his heart brings out what is good; and an evil man from the evil stored up brings out what is evil; for from the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks.

46. »And why do you all call me `Master, Master' and yet not do what I tell you?«

47. Every one who comes to me and listens to my words and puts them in practice, I will show you whom he is like.

48. He is like a man building a house, who digs and goes deep, and lays the foundation on the rock; and when a flood comes, the torrent bursts upon that house, but is unable to shake it, because it is securely built.

49. But he who has heard and not practised is like a man who has built a house upon the soft soil without a foundation, against which the torrent bursts, and immediately it collapses, and terrible is the wreck and ruin of that house.«

## Luke 7

1. After He had finished teaching all these things in the hearing of the people, He went into Capernaum.

2. Here the servant of a certain Captain, a man dear to his master, was ill and at the point of death;

3. and the Captain, hearing about Jesus, sent to Him some of the Jewish Elders, begging Him to come and restore his servant to health.

4. And they, when they came to Jesus, earnestly entreated Him, pleading, »He deserves to have this favour granted him,

5. for he loves our nation, and at his own expense he built our synagogue for us.«

6. Then Jesus went with them. But when He was not far from the house, the Captain sent friends to Him with the message: »Sir, do not trouble to come. I am not worthy of having you come under my roof;

7. and therefore I did not deem myself worthy to come to you. Only speak the word, and let my young man be cured.

8. For I too am a man obedient to authority, and have soldiers under me; and I say to one, `Go,' and he goes; to another, `Come,' and he comes; and to my slave, `Do this or that,' and he does it.«

9. Jesus listened to the Captain's message and was astonished at him, and He turned and said to the crowd that followed Him, »I tell you that not even in Israel have I found faith like that.«

10. And the friends who had been sent, on returning to the house, found the servant in perfect health.

11. Shortly afterwards He went to a town called Nain, attended by His disciples and a great crowd of people.

12. And just as He reached the gate of the town, they happened to be bringing out for burial a dead man who was his mother's only son; and she was a widow; and a great number of the townspeople were with her.

13. The Lord saw her, was moved with pity for her, and said to her, »Do not weep.«

14. Then He went close and touched the bier, and the bearers halted. »Young man,« He said, »I command you, wake!«

15. The dead man sat up and began to speak; and He restored him to his mother.

16. All were awe-struck, and they gave glory to God–some saying, »A Prophet, a great Prophet, has risen up among us.« Others said, »God has not forgotten His People.«

17. And the report of what Jesus had done spread through the whole of Judaea and in all the surrounding districts.

18. John's disciples brought him an account of all these things;

19. so John called two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord. »Are you the Coming One?« he asked, »or is there another that we are to expect?«

20. The men came to Jesus and said, »John the Baptist has sent us to you with this question: `Are you the Coming One, or is there another that we are to expect?'«

21. He immediately cured many of diseases, severe pain, and evil spirits, and to many who were blind He gave the gift of sight.

22. Then He answered the messengers, »Go and report to John what you have seen and heard. Blind men receive sight, the lame walk, lepers are purified, deaf persons hear, the dead are raised to life, the poor have the Good News proclaimed to them.

23. And blessed is every one who does not stumble and fall because of my claims.«

24. When John's messengers were gone, He proceeded to say to the multitude concerning John, »What did you go out into the Desert to gaze at? A reed waving in the wind?

25. But what did you go out to see? A man wearing luxurious clothes? People who are gorgeously dressed and live in luxury are found in palaces.

26. But what did you go out to see? A Prophet? Aye, I tell you, and far more than a Prophet.

27. John is the man about whom it is written, `See, I am sending My messenger before thy face, and he shall make ready thy way before thee.'

28. »I tell you that among all of women born there is not one greater than John. Yet one who is of lower rank in the Kingdom of God is greater than he.«

29. And all the people, including the tax-gatherers, when they listened to him upheld the righteousness of God, by being baptized with John's baptism.

30. But the Pharisees and expounders of the Law have frustrated God's purpose as to their own lives, by refusing to be baptized.

31. »To what then shall I compare the men of the present generation, and what do they resemble?«

32. They are like children sitting in the public square and calling out to one another, `We have played the flute to you, and you have not danced: we have sung dirges, and you have not shown sorrow.'

33. For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, `He has a demon!'

34. The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, `Look, there is a man who is overfond of eating and drinking–he is a friend of tax-gatherers and notorious sinners!'

35. But wisdom is justified by all who are truly wise.«

36. Now one of the Pharisees repeatedly invited Him to a meal at his house; so He entered the house and reclined at the table.

37. And there was a woman in the town who was a notorious sinner. Having learnt that Jesus was at table in the Pharisee's house she brought a flask of perfume,

38. and, standing behind close to His feet, weeping, began to wet His feet with her tears; and with her hair she wiped the tears away again, while she lovingly kissed His feet and poured the perfume over them.

39. Noticing this, the Pharisee, His host, said to himself, »This man, if he were really a Prophet, would know who and what sort of person this woman is who is touching him–and would know that she is an immoral woman.«

40. In answer to his thoughts Jesus said to him, »Simon, I have a word to say to you.« »Rabbi, say on,« he replied.

41. »There were once two men in debt to one money-lender,« said Jesus; »one owed him five hundred shillings and the other fifty.

42. But neither of them could pay anything; so he freely forgave them both. Tell me, then, which of them will love him most?«

43. »I suppose,« replied Simon, »the one to whom he forgave most.«»You have judged rightly,« Jesus rejoined.

44. Then turning towards the woman He said to Simon, »Do you see this woman? I came into your house: you gave me no water for my feet; but she has made my feet wet with her tears, and then wiped the tears away with her hair.

45. No kiss did you give me; but she from the moment I came in has not left off tenderly kissing my feet.

46. No oil did you pour even on my head; but she has poured perfume upon my feet.

47. This is the reason why I tell you that her sins, her many sins, are forgiven–because she has loved much; but he who is forgiven little, loves little.«

48. And He said to her, »Your sins are forgiven.«

49. Then the other guests began to say to themselves, »Who can this man be who even forgives sins?«

50. But He said to the woman, »Your faith has cured you: go, and be at peace.«

## Luke 8

1. Shortly after this He visited town after town, and village after village, proclaiming His Message and telling the Good News of the Kingdom of God. The Twelve were with Him,

2. and certain women whom He had delivered from evil spirits and various diseases–Mary of Magdala, out of whom seven demons had come,

3. and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many other women, all of whom contributed to the support of Jesus and His Apostles.

4. And when a great crowd was assembling, and was receiving additions from one town after another, He spoke a parable to them.

5. »The sower,« He said, »goes out to sow his seed; and as he sows, some of the seed falls by the way-side, and is trodden upon, or the birds of the air come and peck it up.

6. Another part drops upon the rock, and after growing up it withers away for want of moisture.

7. Another part falls among the thorns, and the thorns grow up with it and stifle it.

8. But some of the seed falls into good ground, and grows up and yields a return of a hundred for one.« While thus speaking, He cried aloud and said, »Listen, every one who has ears to listen with!«

9. The disciples proceeded to ask Him what this parable meant.

10. »To you,« He replied, »it is granted to know the secrets of the Kingdom of God; but all others are taught by parables, in order that they may see and yet not see, and may hear and yet not understand.

11. The meaning of the parable is as follows. The seed is God's Message.

12. Those by the way-side are those who have heard, and then the Devil comes and carries away the Message from their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.

13. Those on the rock are the people who on hearing the Message receive it joyfully; but they have no root: for a time they believe, but when trial comes they fall away.

14. That which fell among the thorns means those who have heard, but as they go on their way, the Message is stifled by the anxieties, wealth and gaieties of time, and they yield nothing in perfection.

15. But as for that in the good ground, it means those who, having listened to the Message with open minds and in a right spirit, hold it fast, and patiently yield a return.

16. »When any one lights a lamp, he does not cover it with a vessel or hide it under a couch; he puts it on a lampstand, that people who enter the room may see the light.«

17. There is nothing hidden, which shall not be openly seen; nor anything secret, which shall not be known and come into the light of day.

18. Be careful, therefore, how you hear; for whoever has anything, to him more shall be given, and whoever has nothing, even that which he thinks he has shall be taken away from him.«

19. Then came to Him His mother and His brothers, but could not get near Him for the crowd.

20. But He was told, »Your mother and brothers are standing on the edge of the crowd, and want to see you.«

21. »My mother and my brothers,« He replied, »are these who hear God's Message and obey it.«

22. One day He went on board a boat–both He and his disciples; and He said to them, »Let us cross over to the other side of the Lake.« So they set sail.

23. dummy verses inserted by amos

24. So they came and woke Him, crying, »Rabbi, Rabbi, we are drowning.« Then He roused Himself and rebuked the wind and the surging of the water, and they ceased and there was a calm.

25. »Where is your faith?« He asked them. But they were filled with terror and amazement, and said to one another, »Who then is this? for He gives orders both to wind and waves, and they obey Him.«

26. Then they put in to shore in the country of the Gerasenes, which lies opposite to Galilee.

27. Here, on landing, He was met by one of the townsmen who was possessed by demons–for a long time he had not put on any garment, nor did he live in a house, but in the tombs.

28. When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before Him, and said in a loud voice, »What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of God Most High? Do not torture me, I beseech you.«

29. For already He had been commanding the foul spirit to come out of the man. For many a time it had seized and held him, and they had repeatedly put him in chains and fetters and kept guard over him, but he used to break the chains to pieces, and, impelled by the demon, to escape into the Desert.

30. »What is your name?« Jesus asked him. »Legion,« he replied–because a great number of demons had entered into him;

31. and they besought Him not to command them to be gone into the Bottomless Pit.

32. Now there was a great herd of swine there feeding on the hill-side; and the demons begged Him to give them leave to go into them, and He gave them leave.

33. The demons came out of the man and left him, and entered into the swine; and the herd rushed violently over the cliff into the Lake and were drowned.

34. The swineherds, seeing what had happened, fled and reported it both in town and country;

35. whereupon the people came out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and they found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they were terrified.

36. And those who had seen it told them how the demoniac was cured.

37. Then the whole population of the Gerasenes and of the adjacent districts begged Him to depart from them; for their terror was great. So He went on board and returned.

38. But the man from whom the demons had gone out earnestly asked permission to go with Him; but He sent him away.

39. »Return home,« He said, »and tell there all that God has done for you.« So he went and published through the whole town all that Jesus had done for him.

40. Now when Jesus was returning, the people gave Him a warm welcome; for they had all been looking out for Him.

41. Just then there came a man named Jair, a Warden of the Synagogue, who threw himself at the feet of Jesus, and entreated Him to come to his house;

42. for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. And as He went, the dense throng crowded on Him.

43. And a woman who for twelve years had been afflicted with haemorrhage –and had spent on doctors all she had, but none of them had been able to cure her–

44. came close behind Him and touched the tassel of His robe; and instantly her flow of blood stopped.

45. »Who is it touched me?« Jesus asked. And when all denied having done so, Peter and the rest said, »Rabbi, the crowds are hemming you in and pressing on you.«

46. »Some one has touched me,« Jesus replied, »for I feel that power has gone out from me.«

47. Then the woman, perceiving that she had not escaped notice, came trembling, and throwing herself down at His feet she stated before all the people the reason why she had touched Him and how she was instantly cured.

48. »Daughter,« said He, »your faith has cured you; go, and be at peace.«

49. While He was still speaking, some one came to the Warden of the Synagogue from his house and said, »Your daughter is dead; trouble the Rabbi no further.«

50. Jesus heard the words and said to him, »Have no fear. Only believe, and she shall be restored to life.«

51. So He came to the house, but allowed no one to go in with Him but Peter and John and James and the girl's father and mother.

52. The people were all weeping aloud and beating their breasts for her; but He said, »Leave off wailing; for she is not dead, but asleep.«

53. And they jeered at Him, knowing that she was dead.

54. He, however, took her by the hand and called aloud, »Child, awake!«

55. And her spirit returned, and instantly she stood up; and He directed them to give her some food.

56. Her parents were astounded; but He forbad them to mention the matter to any one.

## Luke 9

1. Then calling the Twelve together He conferred on them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases;

2. and sent them out to proclaim the Kingdom of God and to cure the sick.

3. And He commanded them, »Take nothing for your journey; neither stick nor bag nor bread nor money; and do not have an extra under garment.

4. Whatever house you enter, make that your home, and from it start afresh.

5. Wherever they refuse to receive you, as you leave that town shake off the very dust from your feet as a protest against them.«

6. So they departed and visited village after village, spreading the Good News and performing cures everywhere.

7. Now Herod the Tetrarch heard of all that was going on; and he was bewildered because of its being said by some that John had come back to life,

8. by others that Elijah had appeared, and by others that some one of the ancient Prophets had come back to life.

9. And Herod said, »John I have beheaded; but who is this, of whom I hear such reports?« And he sought for an opportunity of seeing Jesus.

10. The Apostles, on their return, related to Jesus all they had done. Then He took them and withdrew to a quiet retreat, to a town called Bethsaida.

11. But the immense crowd, aware of this, followed Him; and receiving them kindly He proceeded to speak to them of the Kingdom of God, and those who needed to be restored to health, He cured.

12. Now when the day began to decline, the Twelve came to Him and said, »Send the people away, that they may go to the villages and farms round about and find lodging and a supply of food; because here we are in an uninhabited district.«

13. »You yourselves,« He said, »must give them food.«»We have nothing,« they replied, »but five loaves and a couple of fish, unless indeed we were to go and buy provisions for all this host of people.«

14. (For there were about 5,000 adult men.) But He said to His disciples, »Make them sit down in parties of about fifty each.«

15. They did so, making them all, without exception, sit down.

16. Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to Heaven He blessed them and broke them into portions which He gave to the disciples to distribute to the people.

17. So they ate and were fully satisfied, all of them; and what they had remaining over was gathered up, twelve baskets of fragments.

18. One day when He was praying by Himself the disciples were present; and He asked them, »Who do the people say that I am?«

19. »John the Baptist,« they replied; »but others say Elijah; and others that some one of the ancient Prophets has come back to life.«

20. »But you,« He asked, »who do you say that I am?«»God's Anointed One,« replied Peter.

21. And Jesus strictly forbad them to tell this to any one;

22. and He said, »The Son of Man must suffer much cruelty, be rejected by the Elders and High Priests and Scribes, and be put to death, and on the third day be raised to life again.«

23. And He said to all, »If any one is desirous of following me, let him ignore self and take up his cross day by day, and so be my follower.

24. For whoever desires to save his life shall lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake shall save it.

25. Why, what benefit is it to a man to have gained the whole world, but to have lost or forfeited his own self.

26. For whoever shall have been ashamed of me and my teachings, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when He comes in His own and the Father's glory and in that of the holy angels.

27. I tell you truly that there are some of those who stand here who will certainly not taste death till they have seen the Kingdom of God.«

28. It was about eight days after this that Jesus, taking with Him Peter, John, and James, went up the mountain to pray.

29. And while He was praying the appearance of His face underwent a change, and His clothing became white and radiant.

30. And suddenly there were two men conversing with Him, who were Moses and Elijah.

31. They came in glory, and kept speaking about His death, which He was so soon to undergo in Jerusalem.

32. Now Peter and the others were weighed down with sleep; but, keeping themselves awake all through, they saw His glory, and the two men standing with Him.

33. And when they were preparing to depart from Him, Peter said to Jesus, »Rabbi, we are thankful to you that we are here. Let us put up three tents–one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.« He did not know what he was saying.

34. But while he was thus speaking, there came a cloud which spread over them; and they were awe-struck when they had entered into the cloud.

35. Then there came a voice from within the cloud:»This is My Son, My Chosen One: listen to Him.«

36. After this voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. They kept it to themselves, and said not a word to any one at that time about what they had seen.

37. On the following day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great crowd came to meet Him;

38. and a man from the crowd called out, »Rabbi, I beg you to pity my son, for he is my only child.

39. At times a spirit seizes him and he suddenly cries out. It convulses him, and makes him foam at the mouth, and does not leave him till it has well-nigh covered him with bruises.

40. I entreated your disciples to expel the spirit, but they could not.«

41. »O unbelieving and perverse generation!« replied Jesus; »how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here to me.«

42. Now while the youth was coming, the spirit dashed him to the ground and cruelly convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the foul spirit, and cured the youth and gave him back to his father.

43. And all were awe-struck at the mighty power of God. And while every one was expressing wonder at all that He was doing, He said to his disciples,

44. »As for you, store these my sayings in your memory; for, before long, the Son of Man will be betrayed into the hands of men.«

45. But they did not understand His meaning: it was veiled from them that they might not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask Him about it.

46. Now there arose a dispute among them, which of them was to be the greatest.

47. And Jesus, knowing the reasoning that was in their hearts, took a young child and made him stand by His side

48. and said to them, »Whoever for my sake receives this little child, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives Him who sent me. For the lowliest among you all–he is the greatest.«

49. »Rabbi,« replied John, »we have seen a man making use of your name to expel demons; and we forbad him, because he does not come with us.«

50. »Do not forbid him,« said Jesus, »for he who is not against you is on your side.«

51. Now when the time drew near for Him to be received up again into Heaven, He proceeded with fixed purpose towards Jerusalem, and sent messengers before Him.

52. They went and entered a village of the Samaritans to make ready for Him.

53. But the people there would not receive Him, because He was evidently going to Jerusalem.

54. When the disciples James and John saw this, they said, »Master, do you wish us to order fire to come down from Heaven and consume them?«

55. But He turned and rebuked them.

56. And they went to another village.

57. And, as they proceeded on their way, a man came to Him and said, »I will follow you wherever you go.«

58. »The foxes have holes,« said Jesus, »and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.«

59. »Follow me,« He said to another. »Master,« the man replied, »allow me first to go and bury my father.«

60. »Leave the dead,« Jesus rejoined, »to bury their own dead; but you must go and announce far and wide the coming of the Kingdom of God.«

61. »Master,« said yet another, »I will follow you; but allow me first to go and say good-bye to my friends at home.«

62. Jesus answered him, »No one who has put his hand to the plough, and then looks behind him, is fit for the Kingdom of God.

## Luke 10

1. After this the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them before Him, by twos, to go to every town or place which He Himself intended to visit.

2. And He addressed them thus: »The harvest is abundant, but the reapers are few: therefore entreat the Owner of the harvest to send out more reapers into His fields. And now go.

3. Remember that I am sending you out as lambs into the midst of wolves.

4. Carry no purse, bag, nor change of shoes; and salute no one on your way.«

5. »Whatever house you enter, first say, `Peace be to this house!'«

6. And if there is a lover of peace there, your peace shall rest upon it; otherwise come back upon you.

7. And in that same house stay, eating and drinking at their table; for the labourer deserves his wages. Do not move from one house to another.

8. »And whatever town you come to and they receive you, eat what they put before you.«

9. Cure the sick in that town, and tell them, »`The Kingdom of God is now at your door.'

10. »But whatever town you come to and they will not receive you, go out into the broader streets and say,«

11. »`The very dust of your town that hangs about us we wipe off as a protest. Only be sure of this, that the Kingdom of God is close at hand.'«

12. »I tell you that it will be more endurable for Sodom on the great day than for that town.«

13. »Alas for thee, Chorazin! Alas for thee, Bethsaida! For had the miracles been performed in Tyre and Sidon which have been performed in you, long ere now they would have repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.«

14. However, for Tyre and Sidon it will be more endurable at the Judgement than for you.

15. And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be lifted high as Heaven? Thou shalt be driven down as low as Hades.

16. »He who listens to you listens to me; and he who disregards you disregards me, and he who disregards me disregards Him who sent me.«

17. When the Seventy returned, they exclaimed joyfully, »Master, even the demons submit to us when we utter your name.«

18. »I saw Satan fall like a lightning-flash out of Heaven,« He replied.

19. »I have given you power to tread serpents and scorpions underfoot, and to trample on all the power of the Enemy; and in no case shall anything do you harm.

20. Nevertheless rejoice not at this, that the spirits submit to you; but rejoice that your names are registered in Heaven.«

21. On that same occasion Jesus was filled by the Holy Spirit with rapturous joy. »I give Thee fervent thanks,« He exclaimed, »O Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, that Thou hast hidden these things from sages and men of understanding, and hast revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for such has been Thy gracious will.

22. All things are delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is but the Father, nor who the Father is but the Son, and he to whom the Son may choose to reveal Him.«

23. And He turned towards His disciples and said to them apart, »Blessed are the eyes which see what you see!

24. For I tell you that many Prophets and kings have desired to see the things you see, and have not seen them, and to hear the things you hear, and have not heard them.«

25. Then an expounder of the Law stood up to test Him with a question. »Rabbi,« he asked, »what shall I do to inherit the Life of the Ages?«

26. »Go to the Law,« said Jesus; »what is written there? how does it read?«

27. »`Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,'« he replied, »`with thy whole heart, thy whole soul, thy whole strength, and thy whole mind; and thy fellow man as much as thyself.'«

28. »A right answer,« said Jesus; »do that, and you shall live.«

29. But he, desiring to justify himself, said, »But what is meant by my `fellow man'?«

30. Jesus replied, »A man was once on his way down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell among robbers, who after both stripping and beating him went away, leaving him half dead.

31. Now a priest happened to be going down that way, and on seeing him passed by on the other side.

32. In like manner a Levite also came to the place, and seeing him passed by on the other side.

33. But a certain Samaritan, being on a journey, came where he lay, and seeing him was moved with pity.

34. He went to him, and dressed his wounds with oil and wine and bound them up. Then placing him on his own mule he brought him to an inn, where he bestowed every care on him.

35. The next day he took out two shillings and gave them to the innkeeper. »`Take care of him,' he said, `and whatever further expense you are put to, I will repay it you at my next visit.'

36. »Which of those three seems to you to have acted like a fellow man to him who fell among the robbers?«

37. »The one who showed him pity,« he replied. »Go,« said Jesus, »and act in the same way.«

38. As they pursued their journey He came to a certain village, where a woman named Martha welcomed Him to her house.

39. She had a sister called Mary, who seated herself at the Lord's feet and listened to His teaching.

40. Martha meanwhile was busy and distracted in waiting at table, and she came and said, »Master, do you not care that my sister is leaving me to do all the waiting? Tell her to assist me.«

41. »Martha, Martha,« replied Jesus, »you are anxious and worried about a multitude of things;

42. and yet only one thing is really necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion and she shall not be deprived of it.«

## Luke 11

1. At one place where He was praying, when He rose from His knees one of His disciples said to Him, »Master, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.«

2. So He said to them, »When you pray, say, `Father may Thy name be kept holy; let Thy Kingdom come;

3. give us day after day our bread for the day;

4. and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive every one who fails in his duty to us; and bring us not into temptation.'«

5. And He said to them, »Which of you shall have a friend and shall go to him in the middle of the night and say, «`Friend, lend me three loaves of bread;

6. for a friend of mine has just come to my house from a distance, and I have nothing for him to eat'?

7. »And he from indoors shall answer,« `Do not pester me. The door is now barred, and I am here in bed with my children. I cannot get up and give you bread.'

8. »I tell you that even if he will not rise and give him the loaves because he is his friend, at any rate because of his persistency he will rouse himself and give him as many as he requires.«

9. »So I say to you, `Ask, and what you ask for shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and the door shall be opened to you.'«

10. For every one who asks, receives; and he who seeks, finds; and to him who knocks, the door shall be opened.

11. And what father is there among you, who, if his son asks for a slice of bread, will offer him a stone? or if he asks for a fish, will instead of a fish offer him a snake?

12. or if he asks for an egg, will offer him a scorpion?

13. If you then, with all your human frailty, know how to give your children gifts that are good for them, how much more certainly will your Father who is in Heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!«

14. On once occasion He was expelling a dumb demon; and when the demon was gone out the dumb man could speak, and the people were astonished.

15. But some among them said, »It is by the power of Baal-zebul, the Prince of the demons, that he expels the demons.«

16. Others, to put Him to the test, asked Him for a sign in the sky.

17. And, knowing their thoughts, He said to them, »Every kingdom in which civil war rages goes to ruin: family attacks family and is overthrown.

18. And if Satan really has engaged in fierce conflict with himself, how shall his kingdom stand?–because you say that I expel demons by the power of Baal-zebul.

19. And if it is by the power of Baal-zebul that I expel the demons, by whom do your disciples expel them? They therefore shall be your judges.

20. But if it is by the power of God that I drive out the demons, it is evident that the Kingdom of God has come upon you.

21. »Whenever a strong man, fully armed and equipped, is guarding his own castle, he enjoys peaceful possession of his property;«

22. but as soon as another stronger than he attacks him and overcomes him, he takes away that complete armour of his in which he trusted, and distributes the plunder he has collected.

23. Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever is not gathering with me is scattering abroad.

24. »When a foul spirit has left a man, it roams about in the Desert, seeking a resting-place; but, unable to find any, it says, `I will return to the house I have left;«

25. and when it comes, it finds the house swept clean and in good order.

26. Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more malignant than itself, and they enter and dwell there; and in the end that man's condition becomes worse than it was at first.

27. As He thus spoke a woman in the crowd called out in a loud voice, »Blessed is the mother who carried you, and the breasts that you have sucked.«

28. »Nay rather,« He replied, »they are blessed who hear God's Message and carefully keep it.«

29. Now when the crowds came thronging upon Him, He proceeded to say, »The present generation is a wicked generation: it requires some sign, but no sign shall be given to it except that of Jonah.

30. For just as Jonah became a sign to the men of Nineveh, so the Son of Man will be a token to the present generation.

31. The Queen of the South will awake at the Judgement together with the men of the present generation, and will condemn them; because she came from the extremity of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; but mark! One greater than Solomon is here.

32. There will stand up men of Nineveh at the Judgement together with the present generation, and will condemn it; because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and mark! One greater than Jonah is here.

33. »When any one lights a lamp, he never puts it in the cellar or under the bushel, but on the lampstand, that people who come in may see the light.

34. The lamp of the body is the eye. When your eyesight is good, your whole body also is lighted up; but when it is defective, your body is darkened.

35. Consider therefore whether the light that is in you is anything but mere darkness.

36. If, however, your whole body is penetrated with light, and has no part dark, it will be so lighted, all of it, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light.«

37. When He had thus spoken, a Pharisee invited Him to breakfast at his house; so He entered and took His place at table.

38. Now the Pharisee saw to his surprise that He did not wash His hands before breakfasting.

39. The Master however said to him, »Here we see how you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup or plate, while your secret hearts are full of greed and selfishness.

40. Foolish men! Did not He who made the outside make the inside also?

41. But as to what is within, give alms, and instantly all is clean in you.

42. »But alas for you Pharisees! for you pay tithes on your mint and rue and every kind of garden vegetable, and are indifferent to justice and the love of God. These are the things you ought to have attended to, while not neglecting the others.

43. Alas for you Pharisees! for you love the best seats in the synagogues, and you like to be bowed to in places of public resort.

44. Alas for you! for you are like the tombs which lie hidden, and the people who walk over them are not aware of their existence.«

45. Hereupon one of the expounders of the Law exclaimed, »Rabbi, in saying such things you reproach us also.«

46. »Alas too for you expounders of the Law!« replied Jesus, »for you load men with cumbrous burdens which you yourselves will not touch with one of your fingers.

47. Alas for you! for you repair the tombs of the Prophets, whom your forefathers killed.

48. It follows that you bear testimony to the actions of your forefathers and that you fully approve thereof. They slew, you build.

49. »For this reason also the Wisdom of God has said, `I will send Prophets and Apostles to them, of whom they will kill some and persecute others,'«

50. so that the blood of all the Prophets, that is being shed from the creation of the world onwards, may be required from the present generation.

51. Yes, I tell you that, from the blood of Abel down to the blood of Zechariah who perished between the altar and the House, it shall all be required from the present generation.

52. »Alas for you expounders of the Law! for you have taken away the key of knowledge: you yourselves have not entered, and those who wanted to enter you have hindered.«

53. After He had left the house, the Scribes and Pharisees commenced a vehement attempt to entangle Him and make Him give off-hand answers on numerous points,

54. lying in wait to catch some unguarded expression from His lips.

## Luke 12

1. Meanwhile the people had come streaming towards Him by tens of thousands, so that they were trampling one another under foot. And now He proceeded to say to His disciples first, »Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, that is to say, beware of hypocrisy.

2. There is nothing that is covered up which will not be uncovered, nor hidden which will not become known.

3. Whatever therefore you have said in the dark, will be heard in the light; and what you have whispered within closed doors will be proclaimed from the house-tops.

4. »But to you who are my friends I say,« `Be not afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do nothing further.

5. I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who after killing has power to throw into Gehenna: yes, I say to you, fear him.

6. Are not five sparrows sold for a penny? and yet not one of them is a thing forgotten in God's sight.

7. But the very hairs on your heads are all counted. Away with fear: you are more precious than a multitude of sparrows.'

8. »And I tell you that every man who shall have acknowledged me before men, the Son of Man will also acknowledge before the angels of God.«

9. But he who disowns me before men will be disowned before the angels of God.

10. »Moreover every one who shall speak against the Son of Man, may obtain forgiveness; but he who blasphemes the Holy Spirit will never obtain forgiveness.«

11. And when they are bringing you before synagogues and magistrates and governors, do not anxiously ponder the manner or matter of your defence, nor what you are to say;

12. for the Holy Spirit shall teach you at that very moment what you must say.«

13. Just then a man in the crowd appealed to Him. »Rabbi,« he said, »tell my brother to give me a share of the inheritance.«

14. »Man,« He replied, »who has constituted me a judge or arbitrator over you?«

15. And to the people He said, »Take care, be on your guard against all covetousness, for no one's life consists in the superabundance of his possessions.«

16. And He spoke a parable to them. »A certain rich man's lands,« He said, »yielded abundant crops,

17. and he debated within himself, saying, »`What am I to do? for I have no place in which to store my crops.'

18. »And he said to himself,« `This is what I will do: I will pull down my barns and build larger ones, and in them I will store up all my harvest and my wealth;

19. and I will say to my life, »`Life, you have ample possessions laid up for many years to come: take your ease, eat, drink, enjoy yourself.'

20. »But God said to him,« `Foolish man, this night your life is demanded from you; and these preparations–for whom shall they be?'

21. »So is it with him who amasses treasure for himself, but has no riches in God.«

22. Then turning to His disciples He said, »For this reason I say to you, `Dismiss all anxious care for your lives, inquiring what you are to eat, and for your bodies, what you are to put on.'

23. For life is a greater gift than food, and the body is a greater gift than clothing.

24. Observe the ravens. They neither sow nor reap, and have neither store-chamber nor barn. And yet God feeds them. How far more precious are you than the birds!

25. And which of you is able by anxious thought to add a moment to his life?

26. If then you are unable to do even a very little thing, why be over-anxious about other matters?

27. Observe the lilies, how they grow. They neither labour nor spin. And yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendour was as beautifully dressed as one of these.

28. But if God so clothes the vegetation in the fields, that blooms to-day and to-morrow will be thrown into the oven, how much more certainly will He clothe you, you men of feeble faith!

29. »Therefore, do not be asking what you are to eat nor what you are to drink; and do not waver between hope and fear.«

30. For though the nations of the world pursue these things, as for you, your Father knows that you need them.

31. But make His Kingdom the object of your pursuit, and these things shall be given you in addition.

32. »Dismiss your fears, little flock: your Father finds a pleasure in giving you the Kingdom.«

33. Sell your possessions and give alms. Provide yourselves with purses that will never wear out, a treasure inexhaustible in Heaven, where no thief can come nor moth consume.

34. For where your wealth is stored, there also will your heart be.

35. »Have your girdles on, and let your lamps be alight;

36. and be yourselves like men waiting for their master –on the look-out till he shall return from the wedding feast– that, when he comes and knocks, they may open the door instantly.

37. Blessed are those servants, whom their Master when He comes shall find on the watch. I tell you in solemn truth, that He will tie an apron round Him, and will bid them recline at table while He comes and waits on them.

38. And whether it be in the second watch or in the third that He comes and finds them so, blessed are they.

39. Of this be sure, that if the master of the house had known what time the robber was coming, he would have kept awake and not have allowed his house to be broken into.

40. Be you also ready, for at an hour when you are not expecting Him the Son of Man will come.«

41. »Master,« said Peter, »are you addressing this parable to us, or to all alike?«

42. »Who, then,« replied the Lord, »is the faithful and intelligent steward whom his Master will put in charge of His household to serve out their rations at the proper times?

43. Blessed is that servant whom his Master when He comes shall find so doing.

44. I tell you truly that He will put him in authority over all His possessions.

45. But if that servant should say in his heart, `My Master is a long time in coming,' and should begin to beat the menservants and the maids, and to eat and drink, drinking even to excess;

46. that servant's Master will come on a day when he is not expecting Him and at an hour that he knows not of, and will punish him severely, and make him share the lot of the unfaithful.

47. And that servant who has been told his Master's will and yet made no preparation and did not obey His will, will receive many lashes.

48. But he who had not been told it and yet did what deserved the scourge, will receive but few lashes. To whomsoever much has been given, from him much will be required; and to whom much has been entrusted, of him a larger amount will be demanded.

49. »I came to throw fire upon the earth, and what is my desire? Oh that it were even now kindled!

50. But I have a baptism to undergo; and how am I pent up till it is accomplished!

51. Do you suppose that I came to give peace on earth? No, I tell you that I came to bring dissension.

52. For from this time there will be in one house five persons split into parties. Three will form a party against two and two will form a party against three;

53. father against son and son against father; mother attacking daughter and daughter her mother, mother-in-law her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law her mother-in-law.«

54. Then He said to the people also, »When you see a cloud rising in the west, you immediately say, `There is to be a shower;' and it comes to pass.

55. And when you see a south wind blowing, you say, `It will be burning hot;' and it comes to pass.

56. Vain pretenders! You know how to read the aspect of earth and sky. How is it you cannot read this present time?

57. »Why, too, do you not of yourselves arrive at just conclusions?

58. For when, with your opponent, you are going before the magistrate, on the way take pains to get out of his power; for fear that, if he should drag you before the judge, the judge may hand you over to the officer of the court, and the officer lodge you in prison.

59. Never, I tell you, will you get free till you have paid the last farthing.«

## Luke 13

1. Just at that time people came to tell Him about the Galilaeans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.

2. »Do you suppose,« He asked in reply, »that those Galilaeans were worse sinners than the mass of the Galilaeans, because this happened to them?

3. I tell you, certainly not. On the contrary, if you are not penitent you will all perish as they did.

4. Or those eighteen on whom the tower at Siloam fell, do you suppose they had failed in their duty more than all the rest of the people who live in Jerusalem?

5. I tell you, certainly not. On the contrary, if you do not repent you will all perish just as they did.«

6. And He gave them the following parable. »A man,« He said, »who had a fig-tree growing in his garden came to look for fruit on it and could find none.

7. So he said to the gardener, »`See, this is the third year I have come to look for fruit on this fig-tree and cannot find any. Cut it down. Why should so much ground be actually wasted?'

8. »But the gardener pleaded,« `Leave it, Sir, this year also, till I have dug round it and manured it.

9. If after that it bears fruit, well and good; if it does not, then you shall cut it down.'«

10. Once He was teaching on the Sabbath in one of the synagogues

11. where a woman was present who for eighteen years had been a confirmed invalid: she was bent double, and was unable to lift herself to her full height.

12. But Jesus saw her, and calling to her, He said to her, »Woman, you are free from your weakness.«

13. And He put His hands on her, and she immediately stood upright and began to give glory to God.

14. Then the Warden of the Synagogue, indignant that Jesus had cured her on a Sabbath, said to the crowd, »There are six days in the week on which people ought to work. On those days therefore come and get yourselves cured, and not on the Sabbath day.«

15. But the Lord's reply to him was, »Hypocrites, does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his bullock or his ass from the stall and lead him to water?

16. And this woman, daughter of Abraham as she is, whom Satan had bound for no less than eighteen years, was she not to be loosed from this chain because it is the Sabbath day?«

17. When He had said this, all His opponents were ashamed, while the whole multitude was delighted at the many glorious things continually done by Him.

18. This prompted Him to say, »What is the Kingdom of God like? and to what shall I compare it?

19. It is like a mustard seed which a man drops into the soil in his garden, and it grows and becomes a tree in whose branches the birds roost.«

20. And again He said, »To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God?

21. It is like yeast which a woman takes and buries in a bushel of flour, to work there till the whole is leavened.«

22. He was passing through town after town and village after village, steadily proceeding towards Jerusalem,

23. when some one asked Him, »Sir, are there but few who are to be saved?«

24. »Strain every nerve to force your way in through the narrow gate,« He answered; »for multitudes, I tell you, will endeavour to find a way in and will not succeed.

25. As soon as the Master of the house shall have risen and shut the door, and you have begun to stand outside and knock at the door and say, »`Sir, open the door for us' –«`I do not know you,' He answers; `you are no friends of mine.'

26. »Then you will plead,« `We have eaten and drunk in your company and you have taught in our streets.'

27. »But He will reply,« `I tell you that you are no friends of mine. Begone from me, all of you, wrongdoers that you are.'

28. »There will be the weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and yourselves being driven far away.

29. They will come from east and west, from north and south, and will sit down at the banquet in the Kingdom of God.

30. And I tell you that some now last will then be first, and some now first will then be last.«

31. Just at that time there came some Pharisees who warned Him, saying, »Leave this place and continue your journey; Herod means to kill you.«

32. »Go,« He replied, »and take this message to that fox: «`See, to-day and to-morrow I am driving out demons and effecting cures, and on the third day I finish my course.'

33. »Yet I must continue my journey to-day and to-morrow and the day following; for it is not conceivable that a Prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem.

34. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou who murderest the Prophets and stonest those who have been sent to thee, how often have I desired to gather thy children just as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not come!

35. See, your house is left to you. But I tell you that you will never see me again until you say, `Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!'«

## Luke 14

1. One day –it was a Sabbath– He was taking a meal at the house of one of the Rulers of the Pharisee party, while they were closely watching Him.

2. In front of Him was a man suffering from dropsy.

3. This led Jesus to ask the lawyers and Pharisees, »Is it allowable to cure people on the Sabbath?«

4. They gave Him no answer; so He took hold of the man, cured him, and sent him away.

5. Then He turned to them and said, »Which of you shall have a child or an ox fall into a well on the Sabbath day, and will not immediately lift him out?«

6. To this they could make no reply.

7. Then, when He noticed that the invited guests chose the best seats, He used this as an illustration and said to them,

8. »When any one invites you to a wedding banquet, do not take the best seat, lest perhaps some more honoured guest than you may have been asked,

9. and the man who invited you both will come and will say to you, `Make room for this guest,' and then you, ashamed, will move to the lowest place.«

10. On the contrary, when you are invited go and take the lowest place, that when your host comes round he may say to you, `My friend, come up higher.' This will be doing you honour in the presence of all the other guests.

11. For whoever uplifts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be uplifted.

12. Also to His host, who had invited Him, He said, »When you give a breakfast or a dinner, do not invite your friends or brothers or relatives or rich neighbours, lest perhaps they should invite you in return and a requital be made you.

13. But when you entertain, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind;

14. and you will be blessed, because they have no means of requiting you, but there will be requital for you at the Resurrection of the righteous.«

15. After listening to this teaching, one of His fellow guests said to Him, »Blessed is he who shall feast in God's Kingdom.«

16. »A man once gave a great dinner,« replied Jesus, »to which he invited a large number of guests.

17. At dinner-time he sent his servant to announce to those who had been invited, »`Come, for things are now ready.'

18. »But they all without exception began to excuse themselves. The first told him,« `I have purchased a piece of land, and must of necessity go and look at it. Pray hold me excused.'

19. »A second pleaded,« `I have bought five yoke of oxen, and am on my way to try them. Pray hold me excused.'

20. »Another said,« `I am just married. It is impossible for me to come.'

21. »So the servant came and brought these answers to his master, and they stirred his anger.« `Go out quickly,' he said, `into the streets of the city–the wide ones and the narrow. You will see poor men, and crippled, blind, lame: fetch them all in here.'

22. »Soon the servant reported the result, saying,« `Sir, what you ordered is done, and there is room still.'

23. »`Go out,' replied the master, `to the high roads and hedge-rows, and compel the people to come in, so that my house may be filled.

24. For I tell you that not one of those who were invited shall taste my dinner.'«

25. On His journey vast crowds attended Him, towards whom He turned and said,

26. »If any one is coming to me who does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes and his own life also, he cannot be a disciple of mine.«

27. No one who does not carry his own cross and come after me can be a disciple of mine.

28. »Which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not sit down first and calculate the cost, asking if he has the means to finish it?« –

29. lest perhaps, when he has laid the foundation and is unable to finish, all who see it shall begin to jeer at him,

30. saying, `This man began to build, but could not finish.'

31. Or what king, marching to encounter another king in war, does not first sit down and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand men to meet the one who is advancing against him with twenty thousand?

32. If not, while the other is still a long way off, he sends messengers and sues for peace.

33. Just as no one of you who does not detach himself from all that belongs to him can be a disciple of mine.

34. »Salt is good: but if even the salt has become tasteless, what will you use to season it?

35. Neither for land nor dunghill is it of any use; they throw it away. Listen, every one who has ears to listen with!«

## Luke 15

1. Now the tax-gatherers and the notorious sinners were everywhere in the habit of coming close to Him to listen to Him;

2. and this led the Pharisees and the Scribes indignantly to complain, saying, »He gives a welcome to notorious sinners, and joins them at their meals!«

3. So in figurative language He asked them,

4. »Which of you men, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in their pasture and go in search of the lost one till he finds it?«

5. And when he has found it, he lifts it on his shoulder, glad at heart.

6. Then coming home he calls his friends and neighbours together, and says, `Congratulate me, for I have found my sheep–the one I had lost.'

7. I tell you that in the same way there will be rejoicing in Heaven over one repentant sinner–more rejoicing than over ninety-nine blameless persons who have no need of repentance.

8. »Or what woman who has ten silver coins, if she loses one of them, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully till she finds it?«

9. And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbours, and says, »`Congratulate me, for I have found the coin which I had lost.'

10. »I tell you that in the same way there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one repentant sinner.«

11. He went on to say, »There was a man who had two sons.

12. The younger of them said to his father, »`Father, give me the share of the property that comes to me.' «So he divided his wealth between them.

13. No long time afterwards the younger son got all together and travelled to a distant country, where he wasted his money in debauchery and excess.

14. At last, when he had spent everything, there came a terrible famine throughout that country, and he began to feel the pinch of want.

15. So he went and hired himself to one of the inhabitants of that country, who sent him on to his farm to tend swine;

16. and he longed to make a hearty meal of the pods the swine were eating, but no one gave him any.

17. »But on coming to himself he said,« `How many of my father's hired men have more bread than they want, while I here am dying of hunger!

18. I will rise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before you:

19. I no longer deserve to be called a son of yours: treat me as one of your hired men.'

20. »So he rose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and pitied him, and ran and threw his arms round his neck and kissed him tenderly.«

21. »`Father,' cried the son, `I have sinned against Heaven and before you: no longer do I deserve to be called a son of yours.'«

22. »But the father said to his servants,« `Fetch a good coat quickly –the best one– and put it on him; and bring a ring for his finger and shoes for his feet.

23. Fetch the fat calf and kill it, and let us feast and enjoy ourselves;

24. for my son here was dead and has come to life again: he was lost and has been found.' »And they began to be merry.

25. »Now his elder son was out on the farm; and when he returned and came near home, he heard music and dancing.«

26. Then he called one of the lads to him and asked what all this meant.

27. »`Your brother has come,' he replied; `and your father has had the fat calf killed, because he has got him home safe and sound.'«

28. »Then he was angry and would not go in. But his father came out and entreated him.«

29. »`All these years,' replied the son, `I have been slaving for you, and I have never at any time disobeyed any of your orders, and yet you have never given me so much as a kid, for me to enjoy myself with my friends;«

30. but now that this son of yours is come who has eaten up your property among his bad women, you have killed the fat calf for him.'

31. »`You my dear son,' said the father, `are always with me, and all that is mine is also yours.«

32. We are bound to make merry and rejoice, for this brother of yours was dead and has come back to life, he was lost and has been found.'«

## Luke 16

1. He said also to His disciples: »There was a rich man who had a steward, about whom a report was brought to him, that he was wasting his property.

2. He called him and said, »`What is this I hear about you? Render an account of your stewardship, for I cannot let you hold it any longer.'

3. »Then the steward said within himself,« `What am I to do? For my master is taking away the stewardship from me. I am not strong enough for field labour: to beg, I should be ashamed.

4. I see what to do, in order that when I am discharged from the stewardship they may give me a home in their own houses.'

5. »So he called all his master's debtors, one by one, and asked the first, `How much are you in debt to my master?'«

6. »`A hundred firkins of oil,' he replied.« `Here is your account,' said the steward: `sit down quickly and change it into fifty firkins.'

7. »To a second he said,« `And how much do you owe?' »`A hundred quarters of wheat,' was the answer.« »`Here is your account,' said he: `change it into eighty quarters.'«

8. »And the master praised the dishonest steward for his shrewdness; for, in relation to their own contemporaries, the men of this age are shrewder than the sons of Light.«

9. »But I charge you, so to use the wealth which is ever tempting to dishonesty as to win friends who, when it fails, shall welcome you to the tents that never perish.«

10. The man who is honest in a very small matter is honest in a great one also; and he who is dishonest in a very small matter is dishonest in a great one also.

11. If therefore you have not proved yourselves faithful in dealing with the wealth that is tainted with fraud, who will entrust to you the true good?

12. And if you have not been faithful in dealing with that which is not your own, who will give you that which is your own?

13. »No servant can be in bondage to two masters. For either he will hate one and love the other, or else he will cling fast to one and scorn the other. You cannot be bondservants both of God and of gold.«

14. To all this the Pharisees listened, bitterly jeering at Him; for they were lovers of money.

15. »You are they,« He said to them, »who boast of their own goodness before men, but God sees your hearts; for that which holds a proud position among men is detestable in God's sight.

16. The Law and the Prophets continued until John came: from that time the Good News of the Kingdom of God has been spreading, and all classes have been forcing their way into it.

17. But it is easier for earth and sky to pass away than for one smallest detail of the Law to fall to the ground.

18. Every man who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery; and he who marries her when so divorced from her husband commits adultery.

19. »There was once a rich man who habitually arrayed himself in purple and fine linen, and enjoyed a splendid banquet every day,

20. while at his outer door there lay a beggar, Lazarus by name,

21. covered with sores and longing to make a full meal off the scraps flung on the floor from the rich man's table. Nay, the dogs, too, used to come and lick his sores.«

22. »But in course of time the beggar died; and he was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died, and had a funeral.«

23. And in Hades, being in torment, he looked and saw Abraham in the far distance, and Lazarus resting in his arms.

24. So he cried aloud, and said, »`Father Abraham, take pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame.'

25. »`Remember, my child,' said Abraham, `that you had all your good things during your lifetime, and that Lazarus in like manner had his bad things. But, now and here, he is receiving consolation and you are in agony.«

26. And, besides all this, a vast chasm is immovably fixed between us and you, put there in order that those who desire to cross from this side to you may not be able, nor any be able to cross over from your side to us.'

27. »`I entreat you then, father,' said he, `to send him to my father's house.«

28. For I have five brothers. Let him earnestly warn them, lest they also come to this place of torment.'

29. »`They have Moses and the Prophets,' replied Abraham; `let them hear them.'«

30. »`No, father Abraham,' he pleaded; `but if some one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'«

31. »`If they are deaf to Moses and the Prophets,' replied Abraham, `they would not be led to believe even if some one should rise from the dead.'«

## Luke 17

1. Jesus said to His disciples, »It is inevitable that causes of stumbling should come; but alas for him through whom they come!

2. It would be well for him if, with a millstone round his neck, he were lying at the bottom of the sea, rather than that he should cause even one of these little ones to fall.

3. Be on your guard. »If your brother acts wrongly, reprove him; and if he is sorry, forgive him;

4. and if seven times in a day he acts wrongly towards you, and seven times turns again to you and says, `I am sorry,' you must forgive him.«

5. And the Apostles said to the Lord, »Give us faith.«

6. »If your faith,« replied the Lord, »is like a mustard seed, you might command this black-mulberry-tree, `Tear up your roots and plant yourself in the sea,' and instantly it would obey you.

7. But which of you who has a servant ploughing, or tending sheep, will say to him when he comes in from the farm, `Come at once and take your place at table,'

8. and will not rather say to him, `Get my dinner ready, make yourself tidy, and wait upon me till I have finished my dinner, and then you shall have yours'?

9. Does he thank the servant for obeying his orders?

10. So you also, when you have obeyed all the orders given you, must say, »`There is no merit in our service: what we have done is only what we were in duty bound to do.'«

11. As they pursued their journey to Jerusalem, He passed through Samaria and Galilee.

12. And as He entered a certain village, ten men met Him who were lepers and stood at a distance.

13. In loud voices they cried out, »Jesus, Rabbi, take pity on us.«

14. Perceiving this, He said to them, »Go and show yourselves to the Priests.« And while on their way to do this they were made clean.

15. One of them, seeing that he was cured, came back, adoring and praising God in a loud voice,

16. and he threw himself at the feet of Jesus, thanking Him. He was a Samaritan.

17. »Were not all ten made clean?« Jesus asked; »but where are the nine?

18. Have none been found to come back and give glory to God except this foreigner?«

19. And He said to him, »Rise and go: your faith has cured you.«

20. Being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God was coming, He answered, »The Kingdom of God does not so come that you can stealthily watch for it.

21. Nor will they say, `See here!' or `See there!' –for the Kingdom of God is within you.«

22. Then, turning to His disciples, He said, »There will come a time when you will wish you could see a single one of the days of the Son of Man, but will not see one.

23. And they will say to you, `See there!' `See here!' Do not start off and go in pursuit.

24. For just as the lightning, when it flashes, shines from one part of the horizon to the opposite part, so will the Son of Man be on His day.

25. But first He must endure much suffering, and be rejected by the present generation.

26. »And as it was in the time of Noah, so will it also be in the time of the Son of Man.«

27. Men were eating and drinking, taking wives and giving wives, up to the very day on which Noah entered the Ark, and the Deluge came and destroyed them all.

28. The same was true in the time of Lot: they were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building;

29. but on the day that Lot left Sodom, God rained fire and brimstone from the sky and destroyed them all.

30. Exactly so will it be on the day that the veil is lifted from the Son of Man.

31. »On that day, if a man is on the roof and his property indoors, let him not go down to fetch it; and, in the same way, he who is in the field, let him not turn back.«

32. Remember Lot's wife.

33. Any man who makes it his object to keep his own life safe, will lose it; but whoever loses his life will preserve it.

34. On that night, I tell you, there will be two men in one bed: one will be taken away and the other left behind.

35. There will be two women turning the mill together: one will be taken away and the other left behind.«

36. []

37. »Where, Master?« they inquired. »Where the dead body is,« He replied, »there also will the vultures flock together.«

## Luke 18

1. He also taught them by a parable that they must always pray and never lose heart.

2. »In a certain town,« He said, »there was a judge who had no fear of God and no respect for man.

3. And in the same town was a widow who repeatedly came and entreated him, saying, »`Give me justice and stop my oppressor.'

4. »For a time he would not, but afterwards he said to himself,« `Though I have neither reverence for God nor respect for man,

5. yet because she annoys me I will give her justice, to prevent her from constantly coming to pester me.'«

6. And the Lord said, »Hear those words of the unjust judge.

7. And will not God avenge the wrongs of His own People who cry aloud to Him day and night, although He seems slow in taking action on their behalf?

8. Yes, He will soon avenge their wrongs. Yet, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on earth?«

9. And to some who relied on themselves as being righteous men, and looked down upon all others, He addressed this parable.

10. »Two men went up to the Temple to pray,« He said; »one being a Pharisee and the other a tax-gatherer.

11. The Pharisee, standing erect, prayed as follows by himself: »`O God, I thank Thee that I am not like other people–I am not a thief nor a cheat nor an adulterer, nor do I even resemble this tax-gatherer.

12. I fast twice a week. I pay the tithe on all my gains.'

13. »But the tax-gatherer, standing far back, would not so much as lift his eyes to Heaven, but kept beating his breast and saying,« `O God, be reconciled to me, sinner that I am.'

14. »I tell you that this man went home more thoroughly absolved from guilt than the other; for every one who uplifts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be uplifted.«

15. On one occasion people also brought with them their infants, for Him to touch them; but the disciples, noticing this, proceeded to find fault with them.

16. Jesus however called the infants to Him. »Let the little children come to me,« He said; »do not hinder them; for it is to those who are childlike that the Kingdom of God belongs.

17. I tell you in solemn truth that, whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child will certainly not enter it.«

18. The question was put to Him by a Ruler:»Good Rabbi, what shall I do to inherit the Life of the Ages?«

19. »Why do you call me good?« replied Jesus; »there is no one good but One, namely God.

20. You know the Commandments: `Do not commit adultery;' `Do not murder;' `Do not steal;' `Do not lie in giving evidence;' `Honour thy father and thy mother.'«

21. »All of those,« he replied, »I have kept from my youth.«

22. On receiving this answer Jesus said to him, »There is still one thing wanting in you. Sell everything you possess and give the money to the poor, and you shall have wealth in Heaven; and then come, follow me.«

23. But on hearing these words he was deeply sorrowful, for he was exceedingly rich.

24. Jesus saw his sorrow, and said, »With how hard a struggle do the possessors of riches ever enter the Kingdom of God!

25. Why, it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.«

26. »Who then can be saved?« exclaimed the hearers.

27. »Things impossible with man,« He replied, »are possible with God.«

28. Then Peter said, »See, we have given up our homes and have followed you.«

29. »I solemnly tell you,« replied Jesus, »that there is no one who has left house or wife, or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of God's Kingdom,

30. who shall not certainly receive many times as much in this life, and in the age that is coming the Life of the Ages.«

31. Then He drew the Twelve to Him and said, »See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything written in the Prophets which refers to the Son of Man will be fulfilled.

32. For He will be given up to the Gentiles, and be mocked, outraged and spit upon.

33. They will scourge Him and put Him to death, and on the third day He will rise to life again.«

34. Nothing of this did they understand. The words were a mystery to them, nor could they see what He meant.

35. As Jesus came near to Jericho, there was a blind man sitting by the way-side begging.

36. He heard a crowd of people going past, and inquired what it all meant.

37. »Jesus the Nazarene is passing by,« they told him.

38. Then, at the top of his voice, he cried out, »Jesus, son of David, take pity on me.«

39. Those in front reproved him and tried to silence him; but he continued shouting, louder than ever, »Son of David, take pity on me.«

40. At length Jesus stopped and desired them to bring the man to Him; and when he had come close to Him He asked him,

41. »What shall I do for you?« »Sir,« he replied, »let me recover my sight.«

42. »Recover your sight,« said Jesus:»your faith has cured you.«

43. No sooner were the words spoken than the man regained his sight and followed Jesus, giving glory to God; and all the people, seeing it, gave praise to God.

## Luke 19

1. So He entered Jericho and was passing through the town.

2. There was a man there called Zacchaeus, who was the local surveyor of taxes, and was wealthy.

3. He was anxious to see what sort of man Jesus was; but he could not because of the crowd, for he was short in stature.

4. So he ran on in front and climbed up a mulberry tree to see Him; for He was about to pass that way.

5. As soon as Jesus came to the place, He looked up and said to him, »Zacchaeus, come down quickly, for I must stay at your house to-day.«

6. So he came down in haste, and welcomed Him joyfully.

7. When they all saw this, they began to complain with indignation. »He has gone in to be the guest of a notorious sinner!« they said.

8. Zacchaeus however stood up, and addressing the Lord said, »Here and now, Master, I give half my property to the poor, and if I have unjustly exacted money from any man, I pledge myself to repay to him four times the amount.«

9. Turning towards him, Jesus replied, »To-day salvation has come to this house, seeing that he too is a son of Abraham.

10. For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.«

11. As they were listening to His words, He went on to teach them by a parable, because He was near to Jerusalem and they supposed that the Kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.

12. So He said to them, »A man of noble family travelled to a distant country to obtain the rank of king, and to return.

13. And he called ten of his servants and gave each of them a pound, instructing them to trade with the money during his absence.

14. »Now his countrymen hated him, and sent a deputation after him to say, `We are not willing that he should become our king.'«

15. And upon his return, after he had obtained the sovereignty, he ordered those servants to whom he had given the money to be summoned before him, that he might learn their success in trading.

16. »So the first came and said,« `Sir, your pound has produced ten pounds more.'

17. »`Well done, good servant,' he replied; `because you have been faithful in a very small matter, be in authority over ten towns.'«

18. »The second came, and said,« `Your pound, Sir, has produced five pounds.'

19. »So he said to this one also,« `And you, be the governor of five towns.'

20. »The next came.« `Sir,' he said, `here is your pound, which I have kept wrapt up in a cloth.

21. For I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man: you take up what you did not lay down, and you reap what you did not sow.'

22. »`By your own words,' he replied, `I will judge you, you bad servant. You knew me to be a severe man, taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow:«

23. why then did you not put my money into a bank, that when I came I might have received it back with interest?

24. »And he said to those who stood by,« `Take the pound from him and give it to him who has the ten pounds.'

25. (They said to him, »`Sir, he already has ten pounds.')

26. »`I tell you that to every one who has anything, more shall be given; and from him who has not anything, even what he has shall be taken away.

27. But as for those enemies of mine who were unwilling that I should become their king, bring them here, and cut them to pieces in my presence.'«

28. After thus speaking, He journeyed onward, proceeding up to Jerusalem.

29. And when he was come near Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount called the Oliveyard, He sent two of the disciples on in front,

30. saying to them, »Go into the village facing you. On entering it you will find an ass's foal tied up which no one has ever yet ridden: untie it, and bring it here.

31. And if any one asks you, `Why are you untying the colt?' simply say, `The Master needs it.'«

32. So those who were sent went and found things as He had told them.

33. And while they were untying the colt the owners called out, »Why are you untying the colt?«

34. and they replied, »The Master needs it.«

35. Then they brought it to Jesus, and after throwing their outer garments on the colt they placed Jesus on it.

36. So He rode on, while they carpeted the road with their garments.

37. And when He was now getting near Jerusalem, and descending the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began in their joy to praise God in loud voices for all the mighty deeds they had witnessed.

38. »Blessed is the King,« they cried, »who comes in the name of the Lord: in Heaven peace, and glory in the highest realms.«

39. Thereupon some of the Pharisees in the crowd appealed to Him, saying, »Rabbi, reprove your disciples.«

40. »I tell you,« He replied, »that if they became silent, the very stones would cry out.«

41. When He came into full view of the city, He wept aloud over it, and exclaimed,

42. »O that at this time thou hadst known –yes even thou– what makes peace possible! But now it is hid from thine eyes.

43. For the time is coming upon thee when thy foes will throw up around thee earthworks and a wall, investing thee and hemming thee in on every side.

44. And they will dash thee to the ground and thy children within thee, and will not leave one stone upon another within thee; because thou hast not recognized the time of thy visitation.«

45. Then Jesus entered the Temple and proceeded to drive out the dealers.

46. »It is written,« He said, »`And My house shall be the House of Prayer,' but you have made it a robbers' cave.«

47. And day after day He taught in the Temple, while the High Priests and the Scribes were devising some means of destroying Him, as were also the leading men of the people.

48. But they could not find any way of doing it, for the people all hung upon His lips.

## Luke 20

1. On one of those days while He was teaching the people in the Temple and proclaiming the Good News, the High Priests came upon Him, and the Scribes,

2. together with the Elders, and they asked Him, »Tell us, By what authority are you doing these things? And who is it that gave you this authority?«

3. »I also will put a question to you,« He said;

4. »was John's baptism of Heavenly or of human origin?«

5. So they debated the matter with one another. »If we say `Heavenly,'« they argued, »he will say, `Why did you not believe him?'

6. And if we say, `human,' the people will all stone us; for they are thoroughly convinced that John was a Prophet.«

7. And they answered that they did not know the origin of it.

8. »Nor will I tell you,« said Jesus, »by what authority I do these things.«

9. Then He proceeded to speak a parable to the people. »There was a man,« He said, »who planted a vineyard, let it out to vine-dressers, and went abroad for a considerable time.

10. At vintage-time he sent a servant to the vine-dressers, for them to give him a share of the crop; but the vine-dressers beat him cruelly and sent him away empty-handed.

11. Then he sent a second servant; and him too they beat and ill treated and sent away empty-handed.

12. Then again he sent a third; and this one also they wounded and drove away.

13. Then the owner of the vineyard said, »`What am I to do? I will send my son–my dearly-loved son: they will probably respect him.'

14. »But when the vine-dressers saw him, they discussed the matter with one another, and said,« `This is the heir: let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.'

15. »So they turned him out of the vineyard and murdered him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?«

16. He will come and put these vine-dressers to death, and give the vineyard to others.« »God forbid!« exclaimed the hearers.

17. He looked at them and said, »What then does that mean which is written, »`The Stone which the builders rejected has been made the cornerstone'?

18. Every one who falls on that stone will be severely hurt, but on whomsoever it falls, he will be utterly crushed.«

19. At this the Scribes and the High Priests wanted to lay hands on Him, then and there; only they were afraid of the people. For they saw that in this parable He had referred to them.

20. So, after impatiently watching their opportunity, they sent spies who were to act the part of good and honest men, that they might fasten on some expression of His, so as to hand Him over to the ruling power and the Governor's authority.

21. So they put a question to Him. »Rabbi,« they said, »we know that you say and teach what is right and that you make no distinctions between one man and another, but teach God's way truly.

22. Is it allowable to pay a tax to Caesar, or not?«

23. But He saw through their knavery and replied,

24. »Show me a shilling; whose likeness and inscription does it bear?« »Caesar's,« they said.

25. »Pay therefore,« He replied, »what is Caesar's to Caesar–and what is God's to God.«

26. There was nothing here that they could lay hold of before the people, and marvelling at His answer they said no more.

27. Next some of the Sadducees came forward (who deny that there is a Resurrection), and they asked Him,

28. »Rabbi, Moses made it a law for us that if a man's brother should die, leaving a wife but no children, the man shall marry the widow and raise up a family for his brother.«

29. Now there were seven brothers. The first of them took a wife and died childless.

30. The second and the third also took her;

31. and all seven, having done the same, left no children when they died.

32. Finally the woman also died.

33. The woman, then –at the Resurrection– whose wife shall she be? for they all seven married her.«

34. »The men of this age,« replied Jesus, »marry, and the women are given in marriage.

35. But as for those who shall have been deemed worthy to find a place in that other age and in the Resurrection from among the dead, the men do not marry and the women are not given in marriage.

36. For indeed they cannot die again; they are like angels, and are sons of God through being sons of the Resurrection.

37. But that the dead rise to life even Moses clearly implies in the passage about the Bush, where he calls the Lord `The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'

38. He is not a God of dead, but of living men, for to Him are all living.«

39. Then some of the Scribes replied, »Rabbi, you have spoken well.«

40. From that time, however, no one ventured to challenge Him with a single question.

41. But He asked them, »How is it they say that the Christ is a son of David?

42. Why, David himself says in the Book of Psalms, »`The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand

43. Until I have made thy foes a footstool under they feet.'

44. »David himself therefore calls Him Lord, and how can He be his son?«

45. Then, in the hearing of all the people, He said to the disciples,

46. »Beware of the Scribes, who like to walk about in long robes, and love to be bowed to in places of public resort and to occupy the best seats in the synagogues or at a dinner party;

47. who swallow up the property of widows and mask their wickedness by making long prayers. They will be punished far more severely than others.«

## Luke 21

1. Looking up He saw the people throwing their gifts into the Treasury–the rich people.

2. He also saw a poor widow dropping in two farthings,

3. and He said, »In truth I tell you that this widow, so poor, has thrown in more than any of them.

4. For from what they could well spare they have all of them contributed to the offerings, but she in her need has thrown in all she had to live on.«

5. When some were remarking about the Temple, how it was embellished with beautiful stones and dedicated gifts, He said,

6. »As to these things which you now admire, the time is coming when there will not be one stone left here upon another which will not be pulled down.«

7. »Rabbi, when will this be?« they asked Him, »and what will be the token given when these things are about to take place?«

8. »See to it,« He replied, »that you are not misled; for many will come assuming my name and professing, `I am He,' or saying, `The time is close at hand.' Do not go and follow them.

9. But when you hear of wars and turmoils, be not afraid; for these things must happen first, but the end does not come immediately.«

10. Then He said to them, »Nation will rise in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.

11. And there will be great earthquakes, and in places famines and pestilence; and there will be terrible sights and wonderful tokens from Heaven.

12. »But before all these things happen they will lay hands on you and persecute you. They will deliver you up to synagogues and to prison, and you will be brought before kings and governors for my sake.«

13. In the end all this will be evidence of your fidelity.

14. »Make up your minds, however, not to prepare a defence beforehand,

15. for I will give you utterance and wisdom which none of your opponents will be able to withstand or reply to.«

16. You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers, relatives, friends; and some of you they will put to death.

17. You will be the objects of universal hatred because you are called by my name;

18. and yet not a hair of your heads shall perish.

19. By your patient endurance you will purchase your lives.

20. »But when you see Jerusalem with armies encamping round her on every side, then be certain that her overthrow is close at hand.«

21. Then let those who shall be in Judaea escape to the hills; let those who are in the city leave it, and those who are in the country not enter in.

22. For those are the days of vengeance and of fulfilling all that is written.

23. »Alas for the women who at that time are with child or who have infants; for there will be great distress in the land, and anger towards this People.«

24. They will fall by the sword, or be carried off into slavery among all the Gentiles. And Jerusalem will be trampled under foot by the Gentiles, till the appointed times of the Gentiles have expired.

25. »There will be signs in sun, moon, and stars; and on earth anguish among the nations in their bewilderment at the roaring of the sea and its billows;«

26. while men's hearts are fainting for fear, and for anxious expectation of what is coming on the world. For the forces which control the heavens will be disordered and disturbed.

27. And then will they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great power and glory.

28. But when all this is beginning to take place, grieve no longer. Lift up your heads, because your deliverance is drawing near.«

29. And He spoke a parable to them. »See,« He said, »the fig-tree and all the trees.

30. As soon as they have shot out their leaves, you know at a glance that summer is now near.

31. So also, when you see these things happening, you may be sure that the Kingdom of God is near.

32. I tell you in solemn truth that the present generation will certainly not pass away without all these things having first taken place.

33. Earth and sky will pass away, but it is certain that my words will not pass away.

34. »But take heed to yourselves, lest your souls be weighed down with self-indulgence and drunkenness or the anxieties of this life, and that day come upon you, suddenly, like a falling trap;

35. for it will come on all dwellers on the face of the whole earth.

36. But beware of slumbering; and every moment pray that you may be fully strengthened to escape from all these coming evils, and to take your stand in the presence of the Son of Man.«

37. His habit at this time was to teach in the Temple by day, but to go out and spend the night on the Mount called the Oliveyard.

38. And all the people came to Him in the Temple, early in the morning, to listen to Him.

## Luke 22

1. Meanwhile the Festival of the Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching,

2. and the High Priests and the Scribes were contriving how to destroy Him. But they feared the people.

3. Satan, however, entered into Judas (the man called Iscariot) who was one of the Twelve.

4. He went and conferred with the High Priests and Commanders as to how he should deliver Him up to them.

5. This gave them great pleasure, and they agreed to pay him.

6. He accepted their offer, and then looked out for an opportunity to betray Him when the people were not there.

7. When the day of the Unleavened Bread came –the day for the Passover lamb to be sacrificed–

8. Jesus sent Peter and John with instructions. »Go,« He said, »and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat it.«

9. »Where shall we prepare it?« they asked.

10. »You will no sooner have entered the city,« He replied, »than you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him into the house to which he goes,

11. and say to the master of the house, »`The Rabbi asks you, Where is the room where I can eat the Passover with my disciples?'

12. »And he will show you a large furnished room upstairs. There make your preparations.«

13. So they went and found all as He had told them; and they got the Passover ready.

14. When the time was come, and He had taken His place at table, and the Apostles with Him,

15. He said to them, »Earnestly have I longed to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;

16. for I tell you that I certainly shall not eat one again till its full meaning has been brought out in the Kingdom of God.«

17. Then, having received the cup and given thanks, He said, »Take this and share it among yourselves;

18. for I tell you that from this time I will never drink the produce of the vine till the Kingdom of God has come.«

19. Then, taking a Passover biscuit, He gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, »This is my body which is being given on your behalf: this do in remembrance of me.«

20. He gave them the cup in like manner, when the meal was over. »This cup,« He said, »is the new Covenant ratified by my blood which is to be poured out on your behalf.

21. Yet the hand of him who is betraying me is at the table with me.

22. For indeed the Son of Man goes on His way–His pre-destined way; yet alas for that man who is betraying Him!«

23. Thereupon they began to discuss with one another which of them it could possibly be who was about to do this.

24. There arose also a dispute among them which of them should be regarded as greatest.

25. But He said to them, »The kings of the Gentiles are their masters, and those who exercise authority over them are called Benefactors.

26. With you it is not so; but let the greatest among you be as the younger, and the leader be like him who serves.

27. For which is the greater–he who sits at table, or he who waits on him? Is it not he who sits at table? But my position among you is that of one who waits on others.

28. You however have remained with me amid my trials;

29. and I covenant to give you, as my Father has covenanted to give me, a Kingdom–

30. so that you shall eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom, and sit on thrones as judges over the twelve tribes of Israel.

31. »Simon, Simon, I tell you that Satan has obtained permission to have all of you to sift as wheat is sifted.

32. But I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail, and you, when at last you have come back to your true self, must strengthen your brethren.«

33. »Master,« replied Peter, »with you I am ready to go both to prison and to death.«

34. »I tell you, Peter,« said Jesus, »that the cock will not crow to-day till you have three times denied that you know me.«

35. Then He asked them, »When I sent you out without purse or bag or shoes, was there anything you needed?«»No, nothing,« they replied.

36. »But now,« said He, »let the one who has a purse take it, and he who has a bag must do the same. And let him who has no sword sell his outer garment and buy one.

37. For I tell you that those words of Scripture must yet find their fulfilment in me: `And He was reckoned among the lawless'; for indeed that saying about me has its accomplishment.«

38. »Master, here are two swords,« they exclaimed. »That is enough,« He replied.

39. On going out, He proceeded as usual to the Mount of Olives, and His disciples followed Him.

40. But when He arrived at the place, He said to them, »Pray that you may not come into temptation.«

41. But He Himself withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and knelt down and prayed repeatedly, saying,

42. »Father, if it be Thy will, take this cup away from me; yet not my will but Thine be done!«

43. And there appeared to Him an angel from Heaven, strengthening Him;

44. while He –an agony of distress having come upon Him– prayed all the more with intense earnestness, and His sweat became like clots of blood dropping on the ground.

45. When He rose from his prayer and came to His disciples, He found them sleeping for sorrow.

46. »Why are you sleeping?« He said; »stand up; and pray that you may not come into temptation.«

47. While He was still speaking there came a crowd with Judas, already mentioned as one of the Twelve, at their head. He went up to Jesus to kiss Him.

48. »Judas,« said Jesus, »are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?«

49. Those who were about Him, seeing what was likely to happen, asked Him, »Master, shall we strike with the sword?«

50. And one of them struck a blow at the High Priest's servant and cut off his right ear.

51. »Permit me thus far,« said Jesus. And He touched the ear and healed it.

52. Then Jesus said to the High Priests and Commanders of the Temple and Elders, who had come to arrest Him, »Have you come out as if to fight with a robber, with swords and cudgels?

53. While day after day I was with you in the Temple, you did not lay hands upon me; but to you belongs this hour–and the power of darkness.«

54. And they arrested Him and led Him away, and brought Him to the High Priest's house, while Peter followed a good way behind.

55. And when they had lighted a fire in the middle of the court and had seated themselves in a group round it, Peter was sitting among them,

56. when a maidservant saw him sitting by the fire, and, looking fixedly at him, she said, »This man also was with him.«

57. But he denied it, and declared, »Woman, I do not know him.«

58. Shortly afterwards a man saw him and said, »You, too, are one of them.«»No, man, I am not,« said Peter.

59. After an interval of about an hour some one else stoutly maintained:»Certainly this fellow also was with him, for in fact he is a Galilaean.«

60. »Man, I don't know what you mean,« replied Peter. No sooner had he spoken than a cock crowed.

61. The Master turned and looked on Peter; and Peter recollected the Master's words, how He had said to him, »This very day, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times.«

62. And he went out and wept aloud bitterly.

63. Meanwhile the men who held Jesus in custody repeatedly beat Him in cruel sport,

64. or blindfolded Him, and then challenged Him. »Prove to us,« they said, »that you are a prophet, by telling us who it was that struck you.«

65. And they said many other insulting things to Him.

66. As soon as it was day, the whole body of the Elders, both High Priests and Scribes, assembled. Then He was brought into their Sanhedrin, and they asked Him,

67. »Are you the Christ? Tell us.« »If I tell you,« He replied, »you will certainly not believe;

68. and if I ask you questions, you will certainly not answer.

69. But from this time forward the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of God's omnipotence.«

70. Thereupon they cried out with one voice, »You, then, are the Son of God?«»It is as you say,« He answered; »I am He.«

71. »What need have we of further evidence?« they said; »for we ourselves have heard it from his own lips.«

## Luke 23

1. Then the whole assembly rose and brought Him to Pilate, and began to accuse Him.

2. »We have found this man,« they said, »an agitator among our nation, forbidding the payment of tribute to Caesar, and claiming to be himself an anointed king.«

3. Then Pilate asked Him, »You, then, are the King of the Jews?«»It is as you say,« He replied.

4. Pilate said to the High Priests and to the crowd, »I can find no crime in this man.«

5. But they violently insisted. »He stirs up the people,« they said, »throughout all Judaea with His teaching–even from Galilee (where He first started) to this city.«

6. On hearing this, Pilate inquired, »Is this man a Galilaean?«

7. And learning that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction he sent Him to Herod, for he too was in Jerusalem at that time.

8. To Herod the sight of Jesus was a great gratification, for, for a long time, he had been wanting to see Him, because he had heard so much about Him. He hoped also to see some miracle performed by Him.

9. So he put a number of questions to Him, but Jesus gave him no reply.

10. Meanwhile the High Priests and the Scribes were standing there and vehemently accusing Him.

11. Then, laughing to scorn the claims of Jesus, Herod (and his soldiers with him) made sport of Him, dressed Him in a gorgeous costume, and sent Him back to Pilate.

12. And on that very day Herod and Pilate became friends again, for they had been for some time at enmity.

13. Then calling together the High Priests and the Rulers and the people, Pilate said,

14. »You have brought this man to me on a charge of corrupting the loyalty of the people. But, you see, I have examined him in your presence and have discovered in the man no ground for the accusations which you bring against him.

15. No, nor does Herod; for he has sent him back to us; and, you see, there is nothing he has done that deserves death.

16. I will therefore give him a light punishment and release him.«

17. []

18. Then the whole multitude burst out into a shout. »Away with this man,« they said, »and release Barabbas to us«

19. –Barabbas! who had been lodged in jail for some time in connexion with a riot which had occurred in the city, and for murder.

20. But Pilate once more addressed them, wishing to set Jesus free.

21. They, however, persistently shouted, »Crucify, crucify him!«

22. A third time he appealed to them: »Why, what crime has the man committed? I have discovered in him nothing that deserves death. I will therefore give him a light punishment and release him.«

23. But they urgently insisted, demanding with frantic outcries that He should be crucified; and their clamour prevailed.

24. So Pilate gave judgement, yielding to their demand.

25. The man who was lying in prison charged with riot and murder and for whom they clamoured he set free, but Jesus he gave up to be dealt with as they desired.

26. As soon as they led Him away, they laid hold on one Simon, a Cyrenaean, who was coming in from the country, and on his shoulders they put the cross, for him to carry it behind Jesus.

27. A vast crowd of the people also followed Him, and of women who were beating their breasts and wailing for Him.

28. But Jesus turned towards them and said, »Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.

29. For a time is coming when they will say, `Blessed are the women who never bore children, and the breasts which have never given nourishment.'

30. Then will they begin to say to the mountains, `Fall on us;' and to the hills, `Cover us.'

31. For if they are doing these things in the case of the green tree, what will be done in that of the dry?«

32. They brought also two others, criminals, to put them to death with Him.

33. When they reached the place called `The Skull,' there they nailed Him to the cross, and the criminals also, one at His right hand and one at His left.

34. Jesus prayed, »Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing.« And they divided His garments among them, drawing lots for them;

35. and the people stood looking on. The Rulers, too, repeatedly uttered their bitter taunts. »This fellow,« they said, »saved others: let him save himself, if he is God's Anointed, the Chosen One.«

36. And the soldiers also made sport of Him, coming and offering Him sour wine and saying,

37. »Are you the King of the Jews? Save yourself, then!«

38. There was moreover a writing over His head: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

39. Now one of the criminals who had been crucified insulted Him, saying, »Are not you the Christ? Save yourself and us.«

40. But the other, answering, reproved him. »Do you also not fear God,« he said, »when you are actually suffering the same punishment?

41. And we indeed are suffering justly, for we are receiving due requital for what we have done. But He has done nothing amiss.«

42. And he said, »Jesus, remember me when you come in your Kingdom.«

43. »I tell you in solemn truth,« replied Jesus, »that this very day you shall be with me in Paradise.«

44. It was now about noon, and a darkness came over the whole country till three o'clock in the afternoon.

45. The sun was darkened, and the curtain of the Sanctuary was torn down the middle,

46. and Jesus cried out in a loud voice, and said, »Father, to Thy hands I entrust my spirit.« And after uttering these words He yielded up His spirit.

47. The Captain, seeing what had happened, gave glory to God, saying, »Beyond question this man was innocent.«

48. And all the crowds that had come together to this sight, after seeing all that had occurred, returned to the city beating their breasts.

49. But all His acquaintances, and the women who had been His followers after leaving Galilee, continued standing at a distance and looking on.

50. There was a member of the Council of the name of Joseph, a kind-hearted and upright man,

51. who came from the Jewish town of Arimathaea and was awaiting the coming of the Kingdom of God. He had not concurred in the design or action of the Council,

52. and now he went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.

53. Then, taking it down, he wrapped it in a linen sheet and laid it in a tomb in the rock, where no one else had yet been put.

54. It was the Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was near at hand.

55. The women –those who had come with Jesus from Galilee– followed close behind, and saw the tomb and how His body was placed.

56. Then they returned, and prepared spices and perfumes. On the Sabbath they rested in obedience to the Commandment.

## Luke 24

1. And, on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb bringing the spices they had prepared.

2. But they found the stone rolled back from the tomb,

3. and on entering they found that the body of the Lord Jesus was not there.

4. At this they were in great perplexity, when suddenly there stood by them two men whose raiment flashed like lightning.

5. The women were terrified; but, as they stood with their faces bowed to the ground, the men said to them, »Why do you search among the dead for Him who is living?

6. He is not here. He has come back to life. Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee,

7. when He told you that the Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.«

8. Then they remembered His words,

9. and returning from the tomb they reported all this to the Eleven and to all the rest.

10. The women were Mary of Magdala, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James; and they and the rest of the women related all this to the Apostles.

11. But the whole story seemed to them an idle tale; they could not believe the women.

12. Peter, however, rose and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw nothing but the linen cloths: so he went away to his own home, wondering at what had happened.

13. On that same day two of the disciples were walking to Emmaus, a village seven or eight miles from Jerusalem,

14. and were conversing about all these recent events;

15. and, in the midst of their conversation and discussion, Jesus Himself came and joined them,

16. though they were prevented from recognizing Him.

17. »What is the subject,« He asked them, »on which you are talking so earnestly, as you walk?« And they stood still, looking full of sorrow.

18. Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered, »Are you a stranger lodging alone in Jerusalem, that you have known nothing of the things that have lately happened in the city?«

19. »What things?« He asked. »The things about Jesus the Nazarene,« they said, »who was a Prophet powerful in work and word before God and all the people;

20. and how our High Priests and Rulers delivered Him up to be sentenced to death, and crucified Him.

21. But we were hoping that it was He who was about to ransom Israel. Yes, and moreover it was the day before yesterday that these things happened.

22. And, besides, some of the women of our company have amazed us. They went to the tomb at daybreak,

23. and, finding that His body was not there, they came and declared to us that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive.

24. Thereupon some of our party went to the tomb and found things just as the women had said; but Jesus Himself they did not see.«

25. »O dull-witted men,« He replied, »with minds so slow to believe all that the Prophets have spoken!

26. Was there not a necessity for the Christ thus to suffer, and then enter into His glory?«

27. And, beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them the passages in Scripture which refer to Himself.

28. When they had come near the village to which they were going, He appeared to be going further.

29. But they pressed Him to remain with them. »Because,« said they, »it is getting towards evening, and the day is nearly over.« So He went in to stay with them.

30. But as soon as He had sat down with them, and had taken the bread and had blessed and broken it, and was handing it to them,

31. their eyes were opened and they recognized Him. But He vanished from them.

32. »Were not our hearts,« they said to one another, »burning within us while He talked to us on the way and explained the Scriptures to us?«

33. So they rose and without an hour's delay returned to Jerusalem, and found the Eleven and the rest met together, who said to them,

34. »Yes, it is true: the Master has come back to life. He has been seen by Simon.«

35. Then they related what had happened on the way, and how He had been recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.

36. While they were thus talking, He Himself stood in their midst and said, »Peace be to you!«

37. Startled, and in the utmost alarm, they thought they were looking at a spirit;

38. but He said to them, »Why such alarm? And why are there such questionings in your minds?

39. See my hands and my feet–it is my very self. Feel me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see I have.«

40. And then He showed them His hands and His feet.

41. But, while they still could not believe it for joy and were full of astonishment, He asked them, »Have you any food here?«

42. And they gave Him a piece of roasted fish,

43. and He took it and ate it in their presence.

44. And He said to them, »This is what I told you while I was still with you–that everything must be fulfilled that is written in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets and the Psalms concerning me.«

45. Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,

46. and He said, »Thus it is written that the Christ would suffer and on the third day rise again from among the dead;

47. and that proclamation would be made, in His name, of repentance and forgiveness of sins to all the nations, beginning in Jerusalem.

48. You are witnesses as to these things.

49. And remember that I am about to send out my Father's promised gift to rest upon you. But, as for you, wait patiently in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.«

50. And He brought them out to within view of Bethany, and then lifted up His hands and blessed them.

51. And while He was blessing them, He parted from them and was carried up into Heaven.

52. They worshipped Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.

53. Afterwards they were continually in attendance at the Temple, blessing God.
