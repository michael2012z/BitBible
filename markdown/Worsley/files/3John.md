# 3 John

## 3 John 1

1. The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.

2. Beloved, I earnestly pray, that thou mayst prosper and be in health, as thy soul prospereth.

3. For I greatly rejoiced, when the brethren came, and bore testimony to thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth.

4. And I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in the truth.

5. Beloved, thou actest faithfully in whatsoever service thou dost to the brethren, and to strangers too;

6. who have borne witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well in forwarding, as is worthy of God.

7. For they went forth for his name's sake, taking nothing of the gentiles.

8. We ought therefore to receive such, that we may become fellow-laborers in the truth.

9. I wrote to the church: but Diotrephes, who affects the pre-eminence among them, doth not receive us.

10. Therefore when I come, I will remember his deeds, prating against us with wicked words: and not content with these, he neither receiveth the brethren himself, nor suffers those that would; and casteth them out of the church.

11. Beloved, do not thou follow that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doth good is of God: but he, that doth evil, hath not seen God.

12. A good testimony is borne to Demetrius by all men, and by the truth itself: yea, and we also bear him like witness, and ye know that our testimony is true.

13. I had many things to write: but I would not write to thee with pen and ink;

14. for I hope to see thee soon, and we shall speak mouth to mouth.

15. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.
