# Titus

## Titus 1

1. Paul a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for promoting the faith of God's chosen people, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness:

2. in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before all ages;

3. and hath in his own times manifested his word, by the preaching, with which I was intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour:

4. to Titus my son in the common faith, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.

5. For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou mightest set in order what remained, and ordain elders in every city as I directed thee:

6. to wit, if any one be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of debauchery, or unruly.

7. For a bishop must be blameless as the steward of God, not self-willed, not passionate, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of sordid gain:

8. but hospitable, benevolent, sober, just, holy, temperate;

9. holding fast the faithful word, according as he hath been taught, that he may be able both to instruct in sound doctrine, and to convince gainsayers.

10. For there are many disorderly persons, vain-talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision; whose mouths must be stopped:

11. who subvert whole families, teaching what they ought not, for shameful gain:

12. as said one of themselves, a prophet of their own, "The Cretans are always liars, mischievous beasts, sluggish gluttons."

13. This testimony is true: for which cause rebuke them sharply, that they may be found in the faith;

14. not attending to Jewish fables, and the precepts of men who turn away from the truth.

15. To the pure indeed all things are pure; but to the polluted and unbelieving nothing is pure; even their mind and conscience is polluted.

16. They profess to know God, but in works deny Him, being abominable and disobedient, and to every thing that is good void of understanding. 

## Titus 2

1. But do thou speak the things which become sound doctrine:

2. that aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in the faith, in love, in patience:

3. the aged women likewise in behaviour as becometh saints, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of that which is good;

4. that they may instruct the young women to be temperate, to love their husbands, to love their children, to be prudent,

5. chaste, keepers at home, good, submissive to their husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of.

6. Exhort the young men in like manner to be temperate:

7. in all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works, with uncorruptness in teaching, gravity, sound doctrine that cannot be condemned;

8. that he who opposeth it may be ashamed, having no evil to say of you.

9. Exhort servants to submit to their masters, to be obsequious in all things,

10. not answering frowardly, not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.

11. For the grace of God, that bringeth salvation, hath appeared to all men;

12. teaching us that denying ungodliness, and worldly desires, we should live soberly, and righteously, and piously in this present world;

13. looking for the blessed hope, and glorious appearance of the great God, and our Saviour, Jesus Christ:

14. who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.

15. These things speak, and exhort; and reprove offenders with all authority: that none may despise thee. 

## Titus 3

1. Admonish them to be submissive to governors and magistrates, to obey their orders, and to be ready to every good work;

2. to slander no man, to avoid contention, to be gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.

3. For we also were formerly foolish, disobedient, going astray, enslaved to various disorderly appetites and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.

4. But when the kindness and love of God our Saviour towards man appeared,

5. not for works of righteousness which we had done, but according to his own mercy He saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Spirit;

6. which He hath plentifully shed upon us, through Jesus Christ our Saviour:

7. that being justified by his grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

8. This is a word which ought to believed and observed, and concerning these things I would have thee stedfastly affirm, that they who have believed in God be careful to excel in good works: for these things are good and profitable to men.

9. But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and strifes and contentions about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain:

10. reject therefore such an heretical man, after the first and second admonition; knowing that such a one is perverted,

11. and sinneth as being self-condemned.

12. When I shall send Artemas to thee, or Tychicus, endeavour to come to me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter.

13. Forward Zenas the lawyer, and Apollos, on their journey carefully, that nothing may be wanting to them.

14. And let our brethren-also learn to excel in good works for necessary exigencies, that they may not be unfruitful.

15. All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
