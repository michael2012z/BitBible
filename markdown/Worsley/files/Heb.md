## Hebrews 1

1. God, who at sundry times, and various ways, spake of old unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken to us by his Son,

2. whom He hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds.

3. Who being the refulgence of his glory and the imprest image of his person, and sustaining all things by his powerful word, having by Himself performed the purging away of our sins, sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high.

4. Being as much superior to the angels, as He inheriteth a name more excellent than they.

5. For to which of the angels did He ever say, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?" and again, "I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to me a Son?"

6. and when He again introduceth the First-born into the world, he saith, "And let all the angels of God worship Him."

7. And as to the angels He saith, "Who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire:"

8. but to the Son, "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; the sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of righteousness:

9. thou lovest righteousness and hatest iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thine associates."

10. And in another place, "Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of thy hands:

11. they shall perish, but thou remainest; and they shall all grow old as a garment,

12. and as a mantle wilt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed; but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail."

13. But to which of the angels hath He ever said, "Sit thou at my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?"

14. Are they not all ministring spirits, sent forth to attend on those who shall be heirs of salvation? 

## Hebrews 2

1. For this reason we ought the more earnestly to attend to what we have heard, least by any means we should be found deficient.

2. For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received it's just recompence;

3. how shall we escape, if we neglect so great a salvation? which began to be declared by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard Him;

4. God also testifying together with them by signs, and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the holy Spirit, according to his own will.

5. For He hath not subjected to angels the world to come, of which we speak.

6. But one in a certain place hath testified, saying, "What is man that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest Him?

7. Thou madest Him for a little while inferior to the angels; with glory and honor hast thou crowned Him, and hast set Him over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet,"

8. For in putting all things under Him, He left nothing which was not to be in subjection to Him: though we do not yet see all things subjected to Him.

9. But we see Jesus, who was made for a little while lower than the angels, in order to suffer death, that by the grace of God He might taste death for every man, crowned with glory and honor.

10. For it became Him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect by sufferings:

11. since He that sanctifieth, and they that are sanctified, are all of one. For which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren,

12. saying, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the congregation will I praise Thee."

13. And again, "I will trust in Him:" and again, "Behold, I, and the children which God hath given me."

14. Seeing then the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also himself in like manner partook of them; that by death He might destroy him that had the empire of death, that is, the devil:

15. and deliver those who through fear of death were all their life-time subject to bondage.

16. For indeed He taketh not hold of angels to save them, but of the seed of Abraham.

17. Whence it behoved Him to be made in all things like unto his brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful high-priest in the things concerning God, to make atonement for the sins of the people:

18. for as He himself hath suffered, in being tempted, He is able to succour those that are tempted. 

## Hebrews 3

1. Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the apostle and high-priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;

2. who was faithful to Him that appointed Him, as Moses also was in all his house.

3. For He was accounted worthy of more honor than Moses, as he who hath built it, hath more honor than the house.

4. For every house is built by some one: and He who built all things is God.

5. Now Moses was indeed faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of the things which were to be spoken:

6. but Christ as a Son over his own house; whose house we are, if we maintain the free profession and exultation of hope firm unto the end.

7. Therefore, as the holy Ghost saith, "To-day if ye will hear his voice,

8. harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness, when your fathers tempted me,

9. proved me, and saw my works forty years:

10. wherefore I was provoked with that generation, and said, They are always erring in their heart, and they have not known my ways:

11. so I sware in my wrath, they shall not enter into my rest."

12. Take heed, my brethren, least there be in any of you a wicked heart of unbelief in departing from the living God:

13. but exhort one another daily, while it is called to-day; that none of you may be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin:

14. for we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold fast our first confidence firm unto the end; inasmuch as it is said,

15. "To-day if ye will hear his voice,

16. harden not your hearts, as in the provocation." For some that heard did provoke; but not all that came out of Egypt with Moses.

17. But with whom was He provoked forty years? was it not with those that sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?

18. and to whom did He swear that they should not enter into his rest, but to those that were disobedient?

19. and so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief. 

## Hebrews 4

1. Let us therefore fear least a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of us should seem to fall short of it:

2. for we are graciously offered it, as they also were. But the word, which they heard, did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.

3. For we who believe shall enter into rest, as He said above, "So I sware in my wrath, they shall not enter into my rest:" though the works of creation were finished from the foundation of the world:

4. for it is thus said concerning the seventh day, "And God rested the seventh day from all his works."

5. And yet in this place, "They shall not enter into my rest."

6. Seeing therefore it remaineth that some are to enter into it, and they to whom it was at first offered did not enter because of their unbelief,

7. He appoints a certain day, called To-day, saying by David so long after, (as it is recorded) "To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts."

8. For if Joshua had given them the rest, He would not afterwards have spoken of another day.

9. There remaineth therefore a rest for the people of God:

10. for he that is entered into his rest, hath also himself ceased from his works, as God did from his.

11. Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, least any one fall after the same example of unbelief.

12. For the word of God is lively and efficacious, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of the very joints and marrow, and judging the thoughts and intentions of the heart.

13. And there is no creature concealed from his sight: but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him, to whom we are to give an account.

14. Having therefore a great high-priest, that is passed into the heavens, even Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession:

15. for we have not an high-priest who cannot sympathize with our infirmities, but was in all respects tempted in like manner with us, yet without sin.

16. Let us therefore come with freedom to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace for our seasonable help. 

## Hebrews 5

1. For every high-priest taken from among men, is appointed for the sake of men in things relating to God, that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins:

2. who can have due compassion on the ignorant and those that are going astray; seeing he himself also is surrounded with infirmity:

3. and for this reason he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer sacrifice for sins.

4. And no one taketh this honor to himself, but he that is called by God, as Aaron was.

5. So also Christ did not glorify himself to be made an high-priest; but He that said unto Him, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee."

6. As He saith also in another place, "Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."

7. Who in the days of his flesh, offered prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears, to Him that was able to save Him from death, and was heard in what He feared;

8. but though He was a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered: and being thus perfected,

9. He became the author of eternal salvation to all that obey Him:

10. having been declared by God an high-priest after the order of Melchisedec.

11. Concerning whom we have much to say and difficult to be explained, since ye are become dull of hearing.

12. For whereas ye ought for the time to be teachers of others, ye have need again of some one to teach you the first rudiments of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk and not of solid food.

13. For every one that wanteth milk, is unacquainted with the doctrine of justification; for he is an infant:

14. but firm food is for persons come to age, who by habit have their senses exercised to a discernment both of good and evil. 

## Hebrews 6

1. Wherefore omitting the discourse about the first principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us proceed to perfection: not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works,

2. and of faith in God, of the doctrine of baptisms, and laying on of hands, and of the resurrection from the dead, and of eternal judgement: (tho' we will do this also, if God permit:)

3. for it is impossible that those,

4. who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Spirit,

5. and of the good word of God,

6. and the powers of the gospel-age, and yet fall away, should be renewed again to repentance: since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God, and make an open example of Him.

7. For as the earth, which imbibeth the rain that is frequently coming upon it, and produceth herbs fit for those by whom it is cultivated, receiveth a blessing from God:

8. but that which bringeth forth thorns and briars, is rejected and near to a curse, (whose end is burning) so are they.

9. But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak for your caution.

10. For God is not unjust to forget your work and labor of love, which ye have shewn to his name, by having ministred to the saints, and yet ministring.

11. And we desire that every one of you would shew the same diligence to acquire the full assurance of hope even unto the end:

12. that ye would not be sluggish, but imitators of them who through faith and patience are inheriting the promises.

13. For when God made the promise to Abraham, because He could swear by no greater, He sware by Himself, saying,

14. "Verily blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee."

15. And thus waiting patiently he obtained the promise.

16. For men swear by a greater Being, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all controversy.

17. Wherefore God being willing more abundantly to manifest unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it with an oath:

18. that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to fail, we might have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us;

19. which we have as an anchor of the soul safe and stedfast, and which entereth within the veil.

20. Whither Jesus our fore-runner is entered for us, being made an high-priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec. 

## Hebrews 7

1. For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings,

2. and blessed him, to whom also Abraham divided the tenth of all his spoils; being in the first place, by interpretation of his name, king of righteousness, and moreover king of Salem, which is king of peace;

3. without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days recorded, nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God, remaineth a priest continually.

4. Now consider how great a man this was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.

5. And those indeed of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment according to the law to take tithes of the people, that is, of their brethren, though they came out of the loins of Abraham:

6. but he, whose pedigree is not reckoned among them, took tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.

7. Now without all contradiction the inferior is blessed by the superior:

8. besides, here men that die receive tithes; but there he of whom it is testified that he liveth.

9. And (as one may say) even Levi, who receiveth tithes, paid tithes in Abraham:

10. for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.

11. Now if perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law) what farther need was there that another priest should arise after the order of Melchisedec, and not after the order of Aaron?

12. For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change also of the law.

13. Now He, of whom these things are said, is of another tribe, of which none ever attended at the altar..

14. For it is evident that our Lord sprang from Judah, as to which tribe Moses spake nothing about the priesthood.

15. And it is yet more abundantly evident, that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,

16. who is made not according to the law of a temporary command, but according to the power of an endless life.

17. For He testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.

18. For there is indeed a disannulling of the preceding command, on account of it's weakness and unprofitableness;

19. for the law made nothing perfect, but the introducing of a better hope did, by which we draw near to God.

20. Moreover inasmuch as He was not made priest without an oath,

21. (for they indeed are become priests without the solemnity of an oath; but He with an oath, by Him who said unto Him, "The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:")

22. by so much is Jesus become the surety of a better covenant.

23. And they were many priests, because they were by death hindered from continuing in their office;

24. but He, because He abideth for ever, hath a priesthood that passeth not to any other:

25. wherefore also He is able to save to the uttermost, those that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them.

26. For such an high-priest was meet for us, who was holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and higher than the heavens;

27. who hath no need, as the Levitical high-priests had, daily to offer sacrifices first for his own sins, and then for those of the people: for this He did once for all, in offering up Himself.

28. For the law appointeth men high-priests, who have infirmity; but the oath, recorded since the law, appointeth the Son to be priest for ever, being fully perfected for it. 

## Hebrews 8

1. Now the sum of the things that have been said is this, that we have such an high-priest, who is sat down at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens;

2. a minister of holy things, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord hath raised, and not man.

3. For every high-priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; wherefore it was necessary that He also should have something to offer.

4. For if He were on earth, He could not be a priest, seeing there are priests already that offer gifts according to the law:

5. who worship under the representation and shadow of heavenly things; as Moses was ordered by God, when he was about to finish the tabernacle. For see, saith He, that thou make all according to the model shewn thee in the mount.

6. But now He hath obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which is established upon better promises.

7. For if the first covenant had been unexceptionable, there had been no room for a second:

8. as we see there was, for after complaining of them, He adds, "Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:

9. not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.

10. But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their mind, and I will inscribe them on their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.

11. And they shall not teach every one his neighbour, and every one his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the lest even to the greatest of them.

12. For I will forgive their crimes, and their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more."

13. Now by saying, a new covenant, He hath antiquated the first: and what is antiquated, and groweth old, is near it's exit. 

## Hebrews 9

1. Therefore the first covenant had also rites of worship and a worldly sanctuary.

2. For there was a tabernacle prepared; the first part, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the loaves set on it, which is called the sanctuary.

3. And beyond the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies, having the golden censer,

4. and the ark of the covenant which was overlaid all round with gold, and in which was the golden pot with the manna in it, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;

5. and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat: of which it is not necessary now to speak particularly.

6. Now these things being thus disposed, the priests always went into the first part of the tabernacle to perform their daily services:

7. but into the second only the high-priest went once a year; and that not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the sins of the people committed through ignorance.

8. The Holy Ghost shewing by this, that the way into the Holy of holies was not yet manifested, the first tabernacle being yet standing.

9. Which figure remains to the present time, wherein gifts and sacrifices are offered, that cannot perfect the worshipper as to his conscience,

10. relating only to meats and drinks, and different washings, and such carnal ordinances as were required till the time of reformation.

11. But Christ being come an high-priest of the good things to come, hath entered once for all into the holy places, through a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is, not of this building,

12. nor by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption for us.

13. For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purification of the flesh;

14. how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God, purify your conscience from dead works, that ye may serve the living God?

15. And on this account He is the mediator of a new covenant, that undergoing death for the redemption of transgressions against the first covenant, they that are called might receive the promise of an eternal inheritance.

16. For where a testament is, there is a necessity of proving the death of the testator.

17. For a testament is valid after men are dead, but is of no force while the testator is living.

18. Whence neither was the first covenant entered into without blood:

19. for when every command was spoken according to the law, by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled the book and all the people,

20. saying, this is the blood of the covenant, which God hath enjoined you.

21. And the tabernacle, and all the vessels of public worship he likewise sprinkled with blood.

22. And according to the law almost all things are purified with blood; and without shedding of blood there is no remission.

23. It was therefore necessary that the representations of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with more excellent sacrifices than these.

24. For Christ is not entered into holy places made with hands, which were but types of the true ones; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:

25. nor to offer Himself often, as the high-priest entereth into the holy of holies every year with the blood of others;

26. (for then He must indeed have suffered often since the foundation of the world) but now once at the conclusion of the ages He hath been made manifest for the abolishing of sin by the sacrifice of himself.

27. And as it is appointed to men once to die, and after this the judgement;

28. so Christ, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear the second time without sin, to those who are waiting for Him, unto salvation. 

## Hebrews 10

1. For the law having but a faint shadow of good things to come, and not the full image of the things, can never, even by the great annual sacrifices which they offer statedly, make the comers thereunto perfect.

2. For then they would have ceased to be offered, because the sacrificers, being once purified, would no longer retain any consciousness of sins.

3. Whereas in these very sacrifices there is a recalling of sins to mind every year.

4. For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.

5. Wherefore upon his coming into the world He saith, "Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire, but a body hast thou prepared me:

6. in whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hadst no pleasure:

7. then said I, Lo I come, as in the volume of the book it is written of me, to do thy will, O God."

8. Having said before, "Thou didst not desire, nor hadst pleasure in, sacrifice and offering, and whole burnt-offerings, and sacrifices for sin," (which are offered by the law) then He adds,

9. "Lo I come to do thy will, O God." (He taketh away the first, that He may establish the second.)

10. By which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

11. And indeed every priest under the law standeth daily ministring, and frequently offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:

12. but He having offered one sacrifice for sins, is for ever sat down at the right hand of God;

13. waiting for the future, till his enemies be put under his feet.

14. For by one offering He hath perfected for ever those that are sanctified.

15. And of this the holy Ghost also beareth witness with us:

16. for after He had said, "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and on their minds will I inscribe them;

17. He adds, and their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more."

18. Now where there is such a remission of these, there needs no more offering for sin.

19. Having therefore, brethren, free admission into the holy places by the blood of Jesus,

20. the new and living way which He hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say,

21. his flesh, and having a great high-priest over the house of God,

22. let us draw near with sincerity, in the full assurance of faith, having our hearts cleansed from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.

23. Let us inflexibly retain the profession of our hope,

24. (for He is faithful who hath promised) and let us observe each other to the incitement of love and good works:

25. not forsaking our assemblies, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more as ye see the day approaching.

26. For if we sin wilfully after having received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins;

27. but a dreadful expectation of judgement, and a fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.

28. If any one that violateth the law of Moses, dieth without mercy under two or three witnesses,

29. of how much greater punishment, think ye, shall he be counted worthy, who hath trampled under foot the Son of God, and accounted the blood of the covenant, by which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and abused the Spirit of grace?

30. For we know who hath said, "To me belongeth vengeance, I will recompense, saith the Lord:" and again, "The Lord will judge his people."

31. It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

32. But call to remembrance the former days, in which after being enlightened, ye sustained a great conflict of sufferings;

33. partly, being made a public spectacle by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, as ye became associates of those who were so treated:

34. for ye sympathized with me in my bonds, and ye took joyfully the plundering of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.

35. Cast not away therefore your couragious profession, which hath a great recompence of reward.

36. For ye have need of patience, that having done the will of God ye may receive the promise.

37. For yet a little while, and He, that is coming, will come, and will not delay:

38. and the just shall live by faith, but if any draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.

39. But we are not of those who withdraw to perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul. 

## Hebrews 11

1. Now faith is the confident expectation of things hoped for, and a conviction of things not seen:

2. for by it the ancients obtained an honorable testimony.

3. By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, for the things which are seen were not made of things which appear.

4. By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God bearing witness to his gifts: and by it, though dead, he yet speaketh.

5. By faith Enoch was translated, that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him; for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God:

6. whereas without faith it is impossible to please Him; for he that cometh to God must believe, that He is, and is the rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.

7. By faith Noah being warned by God of things which were not yet seen, moved with pious fear, prepared an ark for the safety of his family; whereby he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.

8. By faith Abraham when called to go out to a place which he was afterwards to receive for an inheritance obeyed: and went out, though he knew not whither he was going.

9. By faith he sojourned in the land promised him, as in a foreign country, dwelling in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob the heirs with him of the same promise.

10. For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose maker and founder is God.

11. By faith also Sarah received strength to conceive seed, and brought forth a son when she was past age, because she accounted Him faithful who had promised.

12. So that there descended even from one, and him in a manner dead, a posterity like the stars of heaven for multitude, and as the sand on the sea shore, innumerable.

13. These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but seen them from afar, and been persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth.

14. Now they that say such things shew plainly that they are seeking their own country:

15. and if they had been mindful of that from which they came, they might have had opportunity to have returned.

16. But they desire a better, that is, an heavenly one; wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He hath prepared for them a city.

17. By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he who had received the promises, offered up his only son;

18. of whom it was told him, that in Isaac shall thy seed be called:

19. concluding that God was able to raise him even from the dead; from whence indeed he had in a manner received him.

20. By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things future.

21. By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph; and worshipped leaning on the top of his staff.

22. By faith Joseph when he died, mentioned the departure of the children of Israel and gave a charge concerning his bones.

23. By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw he was a fine child, and they were not afraid of the king's edict.

24. By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;

25. chusing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin:

26. esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt, for he looked to the recompence of reward.

27. By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he continued firm as seeing Him who is invisible.

28. By faith he observed the passover and sprinkling of the blood, that he, who destroyed the first-born of the Egyptians, might not touch them.

29. By faith they passed through the Red-sea, as by dry land, which the Egyptians attempting to do were drowned.

30. By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been encompassed seven days.

31. By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with the unbelievers, having received the spies with peace.

32. And what need I say more? for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and Barak, and Sampson, and Jephthah, and David, and Samuel, and of the prophets:

33. who by faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,

34. quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made powerful, became strong in battle, and turned to flight the armies of their enemies.

35. Women received their dead raised to life again; and others were tortured to death, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.

36. And others had the trial of mockings and scourgings, and of bonds too and imprisonment.

37. They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain by the sword: they went about in sheep-skins, and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted,

38. distressed, (of whom the world was not worthy) wandering in deserts, and mountains, and dens, and caves of the earth.

39. And these all, though they obtained an honorable testimony by faith, yet received not the promise;

40. God having provided something better concerning us, that without us they might not be made perfect. 

## Hebrews 12

1. Having therefore so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us lay aside every incumbrance, and the sin that easily besets us, and run with patience the race that is set before us,

2. looking unto Jesus the leader and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.

3. Wherefore consider Him who endured such contradiction of sinners against Himself, that ye may not give out, fainting in your minds:

4. for ye have not resisted unto blood in striving against sin.

5. Have ye forgotten the exhortation, which speaketh to you as to sons, saying, "My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord, nor saint when rebuked by Him?

6. for whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth."

7. If ye endure chastening, God treateth you as sons; for what son is there, whom the father doth not chastise?

8. But if ye be without chastisement, of which all are partakers, then are ye bastards and not sons.

9. Now if we had fathers of our flesh, who corrected us, and we gave them reverence; shall we not much more be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?

10. For they indeed corrected us for a while, as seemed good to them; but He for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.

11. Now no chastening seems for the present to be matter of joy but of grief: and yet afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those that are exercised thereby.

12. Lift up therefore the hands that hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees.

13. And make strait paths for your feet, that what is lame may not be turned out of the way, but rather be healed.

14. Follow peace with all men; and holiness, without which none shall see the Lord:

15. looking to it, least there be any one falling short of the grace of God, least any root of bitterness springing up should be troublesome, and by it many be defiled:

16. least there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one repast gave away his birthright.

17. For ye know that, when he would afterwards have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no room for repentance, though he sought it earnestly even with tears.

18. Ye are not come to a tangible mountain, and burning fire, and a thick cloud, and darkness, and tempest,

19. and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words, which they that heard, intreated that the word might not any more be thus delivered to them:

20. (for they could not bear the strict command, if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or shot through with a dart;

21. and so terrible was the appearance that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and tremble:)

22. but ye are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels,

23. to the general assembly and church of the first-born who are written in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of the just made perfect,

24. and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than Abel.

25. See that ye reject not Him that speaketh; for if they escaped not, who rejected him that gave forth divine oracles on earth, much less shall we, if we turn away from Him that speaketh from heaven:

26. whose voice then shook the earth; but now He hath promised, saying, "Yet once more I shake not only the earth, but also the heaven."

27. Now this expression "yet once more" signifieth the removing of the things that are shaken, as of things which had been appointed only for a season, that those which cannot be shaken may remain.

28. Wherefore since we receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and holy fear:

29. for our God is a consuming fire. 

## Hebrews 13

1. Let brotherly love continue.

2. Be not forgetful of hospitality; for thereby some have entertained angels, not knowing it.

3. Remember those that are in bonds, as if bound with them: and those that suffer evil as being yourselves also in the body.

4. Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed is not defiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.

5. Let your conversation be free from covetousness, and be contented with what ye have: for He hath said, I will not leave thee; I will never, never forsake thee.

6. So that we may say with courage, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

7. Remember your guides, who spake the word of God to you; whose faith imitate, considering the happy end of their conversation.

8. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, to day, and for ever:

9. be not then carried about by various and strange doctrines; for it is good that the heart be established by grace, and not in meats, in which those that have been most exact, have not profited by them.

10. We have an altar, of which those who perform service in the tabernacle have no right to eat.

11. As the bodies of those animals, whose blood being offered for sin is brought into the holy place by the high-priest, are not eaten, but are burnt without the camp.

12. Wherefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate.

13. Let us then go out unto Him without the camp, bearing his reproach: for we have here no continuing city,

14. but are seeking that which is to come.

15. By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.

16. But to do good and to communicate forget not; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.

17. Be ruled by those that are your guides, and submit to them: for they watch for your souls; (as those that must give an account) that they may do it with joy and not with uneasiness: for this were unprofitable for you.

18. Pray for us; for we are confident that we have a good conscience, desiring in all things to behave well.

19. And I the more earnestly intreat you to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.

20. Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the everlasting covenant,

21. make you perfect in every good work, to do his will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

22. I beseech you, brethren, bear with this word of exhortation: as I have written to you in brief.

23. Know that our brother Timothy is set at liberty, with whom (if he come soon) I will see you.

24. Salute all that preside over you, yea and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.

25. Grace be with you all. Amen.
