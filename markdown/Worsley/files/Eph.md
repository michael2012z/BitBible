# Ephesians

## Ephesians 1

1. Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, to the saints, who are at Ephesus, even the faithful in Christ Jesus;

2. grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly things by Christ;

4. according as he hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and unblameable before Him in love:

5. having before appointed us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ unto Himself, according to the good pleasure of his will;

6. to the praise of his glorious grace, whereby He hath made us acceptable in the Beloved:

7. in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the remission of sins, according to the riches of his grace;

8. wherein He hath abounded towards us with the highest wisdom and prudence;

9. having made known to us the secret of his will, according to his good pleasure, which He had before purposed in Himself:

10. that in the dispensation of the fulness of times, He might reduce all things, both in heaven and on earth, under one head in Christ:

11. even in Him, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated to it according to the purpose of Him who effecteth all things after the counsel of His own will:

12. that we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.

13. In whom ye also trusted, when ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also when ye believed, ye were sealed with the holy Spirit of promise,

14. who is the pledge of our inheritance, till the redemption of his purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.

15. Wherefore I also, having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus,

16. and your love to all the saints, cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;

17. that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation to the knowledge of Him,

18. and enlighten the eyes of your understanding; that ye may know, what is the hope of his calling, and how rich the glory of his inheritance in the saints;

19. and what the exceeding greatness of his power towards us who believe, according to the energy of his mighty strength;

20. which He exerted in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead, and set Him at his own right hand in heavenly places,

21. far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:

22. and hath put all things under his feet, and given Him to be head over all things to the church;

23. which is his body, the complete work of Him, who filleth all in all. 

## Ephesians 2

1. And you hath he made alive who were dead in trespasses and sins,

2. in which ye formerly walked after the manner of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that still operates in the children of disobedience:

3. among whom also we were all conversant heretofore in our carnal desires, indulging the appetites of the flesh and of our imaginations; and were by nature children of wrath, even as others.

4. But God being rich in mercy, through his great love wherewith He loved us,

5. hath made us alive in Christ, even when we were dead in trespasses, (for by grace ye are saved) and hath raised us up together,

6. and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.

7. That in the ages to come He might shew the superabundant riches of his grace, in his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus.

8. For by grace ye are saved, through faith: and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God: not by works, that no one may boast:

9. for we are his workmanship,

10. created in Christ Jesus unto good works, for which God before prepared us, that we might walk in them.

11. Wherefore remember that ye were formerly Gentiles in the flesh, called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision made by hands in the flesh;

12. and ye were at that time without Christ, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world: but now in Christ Jesus,

13. ye, who were formerly afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ.

14. For He is our peace, who hath made both one, and removed the wall of partition from between us;

15. having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances, that He might form the two into one new man, in Himself, so making peace;

16. and that He might reconcile both in one body unto God, by the cross, having thereby slain the enmity:

17. and He came and preached peace to you that were afar off, and to them that were nigh.

18. For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.

19. Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the houshold of God;

20. being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone:

21. in whom the whole building fitly joined together increaseth to an holy temple in the Lord:

22. in whom ye also are built up together for an habitation of God by the Spirit. 

## Ephesians 3

1. For this cause I Paul am the prisoner of Jesus Christ for the sake of you Gentiles:

2. as ye have heard the dispensation of the grace of God, which was given me to preach unto you:

3. that by immediate revelation He made known to me the mystery, (as I wrote before in brief, by which,

4. when ye read it, ye may perceive my knowledge in the mystery of Christ,)

5. which in other generations was not made known to men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; that the Gentiles should be co-heirs,

6. and of the same body, and joint-partakers of his promise in Christ, by the gospel:

7. of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God conferred on me by the effectual operation of his power.

8. On me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace bestowed, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,

9. and make all men to see the communication of the mystery, which from the ages past hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ;

10. that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known by the church to the principalities and powers in the heavenly regions;

11. according to the ancient purpose, which He executed in Christ Jesus our Lord:

12. by whom we have freedom and access with confidence through faith in Him.

13. Wherefore I desire that ye would not be discouraged at my afflictions on your account, which is your glory.

14. For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

15. from whom the whole family in heaven and on earth is named,

16. that He would grant you, according to his glorious riches, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit, as to the inner man;

17. that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith: and be ye rooted and grounded in love,

18. that ye may be able, with all the saints, to comprehend what is the breadth, and length, and depth,

19. and height, and to know the love of Christ, which surpasseth knowledge; that ye may be filled according to the abundant fulness of God.

20. Now to Him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think, according to the power operating in us,

21. to Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus, throughout all the generations of eternal ages. Amen. 

## Ephesians 4

1. I therefore, a prisoner for the sake of the Lord, exhort you to walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all humility and meekness;

2. and with long-suffering forbear one another in love,

3. endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace: for there is but one body and one Spirit,

4. even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;

5. one Lord, one faith, one baptism,

6. one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in all.

7. But grace is given to each of us, according to the measure of the gift of Christ.

8. Wherefore it is said, "When he ascended on high, He led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men."

9. Now this expression "He ascended" what does it mean, but that He descended first into the lower parts of the earth?

10. He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.

11. And therefore He gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers; to qualify holy men for the work of the ministry,

12. to the edifying of the body of Christ:

13. till we all arrive in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at perfect maturity, even to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.

14. That we may be no longer children fluctuating and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the artful insinuations of men, and their crafty methods of deceiving;

15. but holding the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him, who is the head, even Christ:

16. from whom the whole body being fitly joined together and compacted by the aid of every joint, according to the operation proportioned to every part, maketh an increase to the edification of itself in love.

17. This I say therefore, and charge you in the name of the Lord, that ye no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk,

18. in the vanity of their mind, darkened in their understanding, and alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, by reason of the hardness of their heart:

19. who, being past feeling, have given themselves up to lasciviousness, to commit all uncleanness with greediness.

20. But ye have not so learned Christ;

21. if ye have indeed hearkened to Him, and been instructed in Him, as the truth is in Jesus; to put off the old man,

22. which according to your former conversation was corrupted with deceitful lusts,

23. and be renewed in the spirit of your mind;

24. and to put on the new man, which according to the image of God is created in righteousness, and true holiness.

25. Wherefore putting away lying, speak ye every one truth to his neighbor; for we are all members of one society.

26. Be angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath;

27. and give not the devil room to ensnare you.

28. Let him that stole steal no more; but rather let him labour, doing some good with his hands, that he may have something to bestow on him that hath need of it.

29. Let no corrupt word come out of your mouth; but what is good to useful edification, that it may benefit the hearers.

30. And grieve not the holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed to the day of redemption.

31. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and fury, and clamor, and calumny, be put away from you, with all malice: and be kind one to another,

32. tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgiveth you. 

## Ephesians 5

1. Be ye therefore imitators of God as his dear children; and walk in love,

2. even as Christ hath loved us, and given Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of sweet perfume.

3. But fornication, and all uncleanness, or inordinate desire, let it not be even named among you; for so it becometh saints:

4. nor ribaldry, nor buffoonery, nor wanton jesting, which are not meet: but rather giving of thanks.

5. For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, (who is an idolater,) hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.

6. Let no one deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.

7. Therefore be not partners with them.

8. For ye were heretofore darkness, but now ye are light in the Lord:

9. walk therefore as children of light, (for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,)

10. approving what is well-pleasing to the Lord.

11. And have no communion with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.

12. For it is a shame even to relate the things that are done by them in secret.

13. But all things to be reproved: are made manifest by the light: for whatever doth make manifest, is light.

14. Wherefore He saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.

15. See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise men:

16. redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

17. Wherefore be not thoughtless, but consider what is the will of the Lord.

18. And be not drunk with wine, in which there is riotous excess; but be filled with the Spirit:

19. speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord:

20. always giving thanks for all to God even the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ:

21. submitting yourselves to each other in the fear of God.

22. Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord:

23. for the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and the saviour of that body.

24. As the church then is subject to Christ, so also should wives be to their own husbands in every thing.

25. Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave up Himself for it:

26. to sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,

27. that He might prepare it for Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing: but that it should be holy and unblameable.

28. Men ought so to love their wives, as their own bodies: he that loveth his wife, loveth himself.

29. For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord also doth the church:

30. for we are members of his body, as if taken out of his flesh, and of his bones, as Eve was out of Adam's.

31. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.

32. This mystery is great: but I speak concerning Christ and the Church.

33. Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and let the wife reverence her husband. 

## Ephesians 6

1. Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.

2. Honour thy father and thy mother, (which is the first commandment with promise,)

3. that it may be well with thee, and thou shalt be long-lived upon the earth.

4. And ye fathers, do not exasperate your children: but educate them in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

5. Servants, obey them that are your masters according to the flesh, with reverential fear, in the simplicity of your heart, as unto Christ:

6. not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;

7. with good-will, as serving the Lord rather than men:

8. knowing that whatever good any one doth, he shall receive the reward of it from the Lord, whether He be a slave or free.

9. And ye masters, do the same to them, forbearing threatening: knowing that ye yourselves also have a Master in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with Him.

10. Moreover, my brethren, strengthen yourselves in the Lord, and in his mighty power.

11. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the Devil.

12. For our conflict is not with flesh and blood only, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the world and of the darkness of this age, against wicked spirits in heavenly places.

13. Take therefore the complete armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all to stand.

14. Stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth, and putting on the breast-plate of righteousness:

15. and having your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace:

16. over all taking the shield of faith, whereby ye will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one:

17. take also the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:

18. praying at all seasons with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance, and intercession for all the saints;

19. and for me particularly, that utterance may be given me, that I may open my mouth with freedom, to make known the mystery of the gospel:

20. for which I am an ambassador though in chains: that I may speak boldly in behalf of it, as I ought to speak.

21. But that ye also may know my affairs, and what I am doing here, Tychicus a beloved brother, and a faithful minister in the Lord, shall make all known to you: whom I have sent to you,

22. for this very end, that ye might know our concerns, and that he may comfort your hearts.

23. Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

24. Grace be with all that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.
