# Luke

## Luke 1

1. Whereas many have undertaken to compose a narrative of the things, which have been fully certified among us;

2. as they delivered them to us, who were from the beginning eye-witnesses of them, and ministers of the word;

3. it seemed good to me also, having thoroughly traced them all from the very first, to write an account of them in order to thee,

4. most excellent Theophilus, that thou mayst know the certainty of the things wherein thou hast been instructed.

5. There was in the days of Herod king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia; and his wife was of the family of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.

6. And they were both righteous in the sight of God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.

7. And they had no child, for Elisabeth was barren; and they were both far advanced in years.

8. And it came to pass, while he was in the order of his course performing the priest's office before God,

9. according to the custom of dividing the office of the priests, that it fell to his lot to burn incense, entring into the temple of the Lord:

10. and all the people were praying without at the time of offering incense.

11. And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right hand of the altar of incense.

12. And when Zacharias saw him, he was startled and struck with fear:

13. but the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias; for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John:

14. and he shall be a joy and transport to thee, yea, many shall rejoice on account of his birth; for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord,

15. and he shall drink neither wine nor any other strong liquor; and he shall be filled with the holy Spirit even from his birth;

16. and many of the children of Israel shall he convert unto the Lord their God.

17. And he shall go before Him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to prepare for the Lord a people well-disposed.

18. And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife far advanced in years.

19. And the angel answering said to him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God, and I am sent to speak to thee, and to tell thee this good news:

20. and now shalt thou be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall come to pass; because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled at their season.

21. And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and wondered at his staying so long in the temple:

22. but when he came out he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he made signs to them, and continued speechless:

23. and as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.

24. And after these days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and retired five months,

25. saying, the Lord hath thus dealt with me in the days wherein he looked upon me to take away my reproach among men.

26. But in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee called Nazareth,

27. to a virgin who was betrothed to a man, whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the name of the virgin was Mary.

28. And when the angel came in to the room to her, he said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured; the Lord is with thee;

29. blessed art thou among women! and when she saw him, she was confused at what he said, and pondered in her mind what sort of salutation this could be.

30. And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary; for thou hast found favor with God:

31. and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS:

32. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God shall give Him the throne of David his father,

33. and He shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.

34. Then said Mary to the angel, How can this be, since I am a virgin?

35. And the angel answered and said unto her, The holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee, and therefore thine holy offspring shall be called the Son of God: and lo,

36. thy cousin Elisabeth also hath conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month with her that was called barren;

37. for nothing is impossible with God.

38. Then Mary said, Behold the servant of the Lord, may it be unto me according to thy word. So the angel departed from her.

39. Then Mary arose and went with speed into the hill-country, to a city of Juda,

40. and came into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.

41. And as soon as Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the child leaped in her womb, and Elisabeth was filled with the holy Spirit:

42. and she cried out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb:

43. and whence is this honor to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

44. for behold, as soon as the voice of thy salutation reached my ears, the child in my womb leaped for joy:

45. and blessed is she that believed; for there shall be a performance of the things that were told her from the Lord.

46. And Mary said, "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour;

47. for He hath regarded the low estate of his handmaid:

48. for behold, from henceforth shall all generations call me blessed:

49. for He that is mighty hath done great things for me,

50. and his name is holy, and his mercy is on them that fear Him, unto all generations.

51. He hath wrought powerfully with his arm; He hath confounded those that were proud in the imagination of their heart.

52. He hath cast down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted the humble.

53. He hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He hath sent away empty.

54. He hath supported Israel his servant,

55. in remembrance of his mercy (even as He promised to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed,) for ever."

56. And Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned to her own house.

57. Now when Elisabeth's time for her delivery was fully come, she brought forth a son:

58. and her neighbours and kindred heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her, and they congratulated her;

59. and on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child: and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of his father:

60. but his mother said, No, but he shall be called John:

61. and they said to her, There is none of thy relations of this name.

62. And they made signs to his father, what name he would have him called by.

63. And he called for a writing-tablet, and wrote upon it, His name is John: and they all wondered.

64. And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake and praised God.

65. And an awe fell upon all that dwelt round about them; and all these things were divulged through the whole hill-country of Judea.

66. And all that heard them, laid them up in their hearts, saying, What a child will this be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.

67. And his father Zacharias was filled with the holy Spirit,

68. and prophesied, saying, "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for He hath visited and wrought redemption for his people,

69. and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us,

70. in the house of his servant David, as He spake by the mouth of his holy prophets from the beginning,

71. even salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us,

72. to display his mercy towards our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant,

73. according to the oath which He sware to Abraham our father,

74. to grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before Him,

75. all the days of our life.

76. And thou, my child, shalt be called the prophet of the most High; for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord,

77. to make known salvation to his people,

78. in the remission of their sins, through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the day-spring hath visited us from on high,

79. to enlighten them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to direct our feet into the way of peace."

80. And the child grew, and became strong in spirit: and he was in the deserts till the time of his being manifested to Israel. 

## Luke 2

1. Now in those days an edict was published by Augustus Cesar, that all the world should be enrolled or taxed,

2. (this tax was first levied when Cyrenius was governor of Syria) and they all went to be enrolled,

3. every one to his own city:

4. so Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem (because he

5. was of the house and line of David) to be enrolled with Mary his espoused wife, who was big with child.

6. And while they were there, the days of her delivery were fulfilled,

7. and she brought forth her son, the first-born, and wrapped him in swaddling cloths, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.

8. And there were in the same country shepherds out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night: and lo,

9. an angel of the Lord stood over them, and the glory of the Lord shone round them, and they were greatly terrified:

10. and the angel said to them, Be not affrighted; for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people,

11. that this day is born, in the city of David, your Saviour Christ the Lord.

12. And this shall be a sign to you, Ye shall find the child wrapped in swaddling bands lying in a manger.

13. And on a sudden there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host,

14. praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards men.

15. And when the angels went from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, Let us go to Bethlehem, and see this which hath been told us, which the Lord hath made known unto us.

16. And they came with speed, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger:

17. and when they had seen it, they divulged what had been told them concerning this child:

18. and all that heard it, were amazed at the things which were related to them by the shepherds.

19. But Mary treasured up all these words, pondering them in her heart.

20. And the shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things which they had heard and seen, according as it had been told unto them.

21. And when eight days were fulfilled for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, having been so called by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.

22. And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought Him to Jerusalem to present Him before the Lord:

23. (as it is written in the law of the Lord, That every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord:) and to offer a sacrifice,

24. according to what is required in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons.

25. And there was a man at Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and he was a just and a religious man, who expected the consolation of Israel; and the holy Spirit was upon him.

26. And it was revealed to him by the holy Spirit, that he should not die before he had seen the Anointed of the Lord.

27. And he came by the influence of the Spirit into the temple, as his parents brought in the child Jesus to do concerning Him according to the custom of the law:

28. and he took Him into his arms,

29. and blessed God, and said, "Now, Lord, thou dismissest thy servant in peace, according to thy word;

30. for mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast provided in the sight of all people,

31. a light for the enlightening of the Gentiles,

32. and the glory of thy people Israel."

33. And Joseph and his mother were amazed at the things that were spoken concerning Him.

34. And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be spoken against,

35. (and a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also) that the thoughts of many hearts may be discovered.

36. And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser; who was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her first marrying,

37. and had been a widow about eighty four years; who departed not from the temple; serving God with fastings and prayers night and day.

38. And coming in at the very same time, gave thanks unto the Lord, and spake of Him to all that were looking for redemption in Jerusalem.

39. And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.

40. And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.

41. Now his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover:

42. and when He was twelve years old, going up to Jerusalem, as usual at the feast, and having finished the time,

43. when they returned, the child Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem: and Joseph and his mother did not know it;

44. but supposing Him to be in the company, went a day's journey, and then sought for Him among their kindred and acquaintance:

45. and not finding Him they returned to Jerusalem seeking for Him:

46. and after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, attending to them and asking them questions.

47. And all that heard Him were astonished at his understanding and his answers.

48. And when they saw Him, they were amazed. And his mother said to Him, Son, why didst thou deal thus with us? behold, thy father and I with grief have been seeking for thee.

49. And He said to them, Why did ye so seek me? Did not ye know that I ought to be in my Father's house?

50. but they did not understand the word which He spake to them.

51. Then He went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.

52. And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men. 

## Luke 3

1. Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Trachonitis,

2. and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, Annas and Caiaphas being high priests, the word of God came unto John the Son of Zacharias in the wilderness:

3. and he went into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance in order to the remission of sins;

4. as it is written in the book of Esaias the prophet, saying, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight:

5. every valley shall be raised, and every mountain and hill shall be lowered, and the crooked ways shall be made straight, and the rough ways smooth:

6. and all men shall see the salvation of God."

7. Therefore said he to the multitudes that came to be baptised by him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

8. Bring forth therefore fruits becoming penitents, and do not say within yourselves, "We have Abraham for our father," for I tell you that God can of these stones raise up children to Abraham.

9. And now the ax is laid to the root of the trees: every tree therefore which doth not yield good fruit, is cut down and cast into the fire.

10. And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?

11. And he saith unto them, Let him that hath two coats, give one to him that hath none, and let him that hath food do the like.

12. And there came publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do?

13. And He said unto them, Exact no more than what is appointed you.

14. And the soldiers also asked him, saying, And what shall we do? and He said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely, and be content with your pay.

15. Now as the people were in suspense, and were all thinking in their hearts concerning John, whether he were the Christ or not,

16. John answered and said to them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but a mightier than I is coming, whose shoes I am not worthy to untie: He will baptize you with the holy Spirit, and with fire;

17. whose fan is in his hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and will gather the wheat into his granary, but will burn up the chaff in unquenchable fire.

18. And many other things by way of exhortation did he preach unto the people.

19. But Herod the tetrarch being reproved by him on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, and for all the wicked things which Herod did,

20. added this likewise to all the rest, that he shut up John in prison.

21. Now, when all the people were baptized, and Jesus was baptized and praying,

22. the heaven was opened, and the holy Spirit descended in a corporeal form, like a dove upon Him, and there came a voice from heaven saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.

23. And Jesus was then about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, the son of Heli,

24. the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi,

25. the son of Janna, the son of Joseph, the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Naum, the son of Esli,

26. the son of Naggai, the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semei, the son of Joseph, the son of Juda,

27. the son of Joanna, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zorobabel, the son of Salathiel, the son of Neri, the son of Melchi,

28. the son of Addi, the son of Kosam, the son of Elmodam,

29. the son of Er, the son of Joses, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,

30. the son of Simeon, the son of Juda, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonan, the son of Eliakim,

31. the son of Melea, the son of Menan, the son of Mattatha,

32. the son of Nathan, the son of David, the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Booz, the son of Salmon,

33. the son of Naasson, the son of Aminadab, the son of Aram, the son of Esrom, the son of Phares,

34. the son of Juda, the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Thara, the son of Nachor,

35. the son of Saruch, the son of Ragau, the son of Phalec, the son of Heber, the son of Sala, the son of Cainan,

36. the son of Arphaxad, the son of Sem, the son of Noe,

37. the son of Lamech, the son of Mathusala, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Maleleel, the son of Cainan,

38. the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of GOD. 

## Luke 4

1. Now Jesus being full of the holy Spirit, returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, being forty days tempted by the devil;

2. and He did eat nothing in all those days: and when they were ended, at last He was hungry.

3. And the devil said to Him, If thou art the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.

4. And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, that man shall not live by bread only, but on every word of God.

5. And the devil taking Him up into an high mountain, shewed Him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant,

6. and said to Him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for it is committed to me, and I give it to whomsoever I will.

7. Therefore, if thou wilt but worship me, they all shall be thine.

8. And Jesus answering him said with indignation, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.

9. And he brought Him to Jerusalem, and set him on a battlement of the temple, and said to Him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence;

10. for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee,

11. to keep thee, and they shall bear thee up in their hands, least thou dash thy foot against a stone.

12. And Jesus answered him, it is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.

13. And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from Him for a time.

14. And Jesus returned by the influence of the Spirit into Galilee: and a fame was spread through all the country round about concerning Him:

15. and He taught in their synagogues with universal applause.

16. And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up: and according to his custom He went into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, and stood up to read.

17. And there was delivered to Him the book of the prophet Esaias; and opening the book, He found the place where it was written,

18. "The spirit of the Lord is upon me to the end, for which He hath anointed me: He hath sent me to publish good tidings to the poor, to heal the broken-hearted, to proclaim deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to release them that are bruised,

19. and to preach the acceptable year of the Lord."

20. And He folded up the book, and gave it again to the minister, and sat down: and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon Him.

21. And He said unto them, this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.

22. And they all bare witness to Him, and wondered at the gracefulness of the words, which proceeded from his mouth, and said, Is not this the son of Joseph?

23. And He said unto them, No doubt ye will apply to me this proverb, "Physician, cure thyself, and do here in thy own country what we have heard were done at Capernaum."

24. But, said He, indeed I must tell you, that no prophet is well received in his own country.

25. And I assure you, there were many widows in Israel, in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months, and there was a great famine through all the land;

26. but Elias was sent to none of those widows, but to a widow-woman at Sarepta in the territory of Sidon.

27. There were also many lepers in Israel, in the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed; but Naaman the Syrian was.

28. And all the synagogue were filled with rage, when they heard these things,

29. and they rose up and drove Him out of the city, and dragged Him to the brow of the hill, on which their city was built, in order to throw Him down the precipice.

30. But He passed through the midst of them, and went away.

31. And He came down to Capernaum a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath-days,

32. and they were astonished at his doctrine; for He spake with authority.

33. And there was a man in the synagogue possessed by the spirit of an impure demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,

34. saying, Let us alone, what hast thou to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art, the holy one of God:

35. but Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him. And the demon threw him down in the midst of the assembly, and came out of him, having done him no hurt.

36. And they were all amazed, and said one to another, What a speech is this? for with authority and power He commandeth the impure spirits, and they come out!

37. And his fame spread all over the country round about.

38. And He rose up and went out of the synagogue, and came into the house of Simon: now Simon's wife's mother had a violent fever, and they intreated Him on her behalf.

39. And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever, and it left her: and immediately she arose and waited upon them.

40. And at sun-set all that had any persons sick of any diseases, brought them to Him: and He laid his hands on every one of them and healed them.

41. And demons also came out from many, crying out, Thou art the Messiah the Son of God. And He rebuked them, and suffered them not to say, that they knew Him to be the Christ.

42. And when the day was coming on, He went out and retired into a solitary place; and the people sought for Him, and came to Him, and would fain have detained Him, that He might not go from them.

43. But He said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.

44. So He went on preaching in the synagogues of Galilee. 

## Luke 5

1. And when the people were pressing on Him to hear the word of God, as He stood by the lake of Gennesareth, seeing two vessels at the edge of the lake,

2. (but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets:)

3. He went into one of them, which was Simon's, and desired him to put off a little way from the shore: and He sat down and taught the multitudes from the ship.

4. And when He had done speaking, He said to Simon, Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.

5. And Simon answered and said unto Him, Master, we have been toiling all the night, and have caught nothing; however at thy word I will cast the net.

6. And when they had done this, they inclosed a multitude of fishes; and their net was breaking.

7. And they beckoned to their partners that were in the other ship, to come and help them; and they came, and filled both the ships, so that they were even sinking: and when Simon Peter saw it,

8. he fell at the knees of Jesus, saying, Lord, depart from me, for I am a sinful man;

9. for he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of fishes which they had taken;

10. as were also James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Be not afraid, from henceforth thou shalt be a captor of men.

11. And when they had brought their ships to land, they left all and followed Him.

12. And when He was in one of the cities of that country, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus, fell prostrate to Him, and besought Him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me.

13. And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, I will; be thou cleansed: and immediately the leprosy departed from him.

14. And He charged him to tell no one: but go, said He, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.

15. But the fame of Him spread more and more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by Him of their infirmities.

16. But He frequently retired into solitary places, and prayed.

17. And one day, as He was teaching, there were pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judea, and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was present to heal the people:

18. and behold, some men bringing on a couch a man that was paralytic; and they endeavoured to bring him in, and lay him before Him:

19. but when they could not find what way to bring him in because of the croud, they went up on the battlements of the house, and let him down from the roof with his couch, into the midst before Jesus,

20. who seeing their faith said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.

21. And the scribes and pharisees began to cavil, saying, Who is this that talketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God?

22. but Jesus knowing their thoughts, answered and said unto them, What are ye disputing in your hearts?

23. Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Rise up and walk?

24. but that ye may know, that the Son of man hath power even on earth to forgive sins, (He spake to the paralytic) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go to thine house.

25. And immediately he rose up before them, took up the bed on which he lay, and went away to his house, glorifying God.

26. And they were all amazed and glorified God, and were filled with awe, saying, we have seen wonderful things to-day.

27. After these things He went out and saw a publican named Levi, sitting at the custom-house, and said to him, Follow me:

28. and he left all, rose up, and followed Him.

29. And Levi made Him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great number of publicans, and others at table with them.

30. And their scribes and pharisees murmured at his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?

31. And Jesus answered and said unto them, They that are in health have no need of a physician, but they that are sick: I am not come to call the righteous,

32. but sinners to repentance.

33. And they said unto Him, Why do the disciples of John frequently fast and pray, and likewise those of the pharisees; but thine eat and drink?

34. And He said unto them, Can ye make those of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?

35. but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, then they will fast.

36. Then He spake a parable to them, That no one putteth a piece of new cloth upon an old garment: otherwise, the new maketh a rent, and doth not match the old:

37. nor doth any one put new wine in to old vessels; otherwise, the new wine will burst the casks, and be spilled, and the vessels will be destroyed:

38. but new wine must be put into new vessels, and then both are saved.

39. And no one that has been drinking old wine, immediately desireth new; for he saith, the old is better. 

## Luke 6

1. And it came to pass on the second-sabbath after the first, that as He was passing through the corn-fields, his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and rubbed them in their hands and ate them.

2. And some of the pharisees said to them, Why do ye do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath-days?

3. And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read what David did, when he himself was hungry and those that were with him? how he went into the house of God,

4. and did take and eat the shew-bread, and gave also to his attendants, which it is not lawful for any to eat but the priests.

5. And He said unto them, the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath.

6. And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that He went into a synagogue and taught; and there was a man there, whose right hand was withered.

7. And the scribes and pharisees watched Him to see if He would work a cure on the sabbath: that they might find an accusation against Him.

8. But He knew their thoughts, and said to the man that had the withered hand, Rise, and stand in the midst: and he rose up and stood forth.

9. Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing, Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to let it be lost?

10. And looking round upon them all, He said to the man, Stretch out thine hand: and he did so, and his hand was made as sound as the other.

11. And they were filled with confusion: and consulted together, what they might do to Jesus.

12. And in those days He went out to a mountain to pray, and He continued all night in prayer to God.

13. And when it was day, He called his disciples to Him: and chose out twelve from among them, whom He also named his apostles:

14. (to wit, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,

15. Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon called Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James,

16. and Judas Iscariot, who was the traitor:)

17. and He came down the hill with them, and stood in the plain; with the rest of his disciples, and a great multitude of people from all the parts of Judea, and from Jerusalem, and from the coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases,

18. even those that were tormented by impure spirits: and they were healed.

19. And all the people endeavoured to touch Him, for there went a divine virtue out of Him, and healed them all.

20. And lifting up his eyes on his disciples He said, Blessed are ye though poor; for the kingdom of God is yours.

21. Blessed are ye that hunger now; for ye shall be satisfied. Blessed are ye that weep now; for ye shall laugh.

22. Blessed are ye when men shall hate you, and reject you, and reproach you, and cast out your name as infamous on account of the Son of man.

23. Rejoice in that day, and be exceeding glad; for behold, your reward is great in heaven: for thus did their fathers to the prophets.

24. But wo unto you that are rich; for ye have received your consolation.

25. Wo unto you that are full; for ye shall be hungry. Wo unto you that laugh now: for ye shall mourn and weep.

26. Wo unto you when all men speak well of you; for their fathers did the same to the false prophets.

27. But I say unto you my hearers, Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you,

28. bless them that curse you, and pray for them that abuse you;

29. to him that smiteth thee on the one cheek, offer also the other; and let him that taketh away thy cloke, have thy coat too rather than strive with him:

30. give to him that asketh thee, and from him that taketh thy goods on loan demand nothing.

31. And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them in like manner.

32. If ye love only them that love you, what thanks are due to you? for even the wicked love those that love them:

33. and if ye do good offices to them that do good to you, what thanks are due to you? for even wicked men do the same.

34. And if ye lend to those from whom ye expect to receive, what thanks are due to you? for sinners also lend to sinners that they may receive an equivalent.

35. But do ye love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing from it: and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the sons of the most High; for He is kind even to the ungrateful and the wicked:

36. be ye therefore merciful as your heavenly Father also is merciful.

37. Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:

38. give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed and shaken down and running over, shall they give into your bosom: for by the same measure, which ye measure with, shall it be measured back again to you.

39. And He said to them by way of parable, Can a blind man guide a blind man? will they not both fall into a ditch?

40. the learner is not above his teacher, tho' every complete scholar will become as learned as his master.

41. But why dost thou look at the chaff in thy brother's eye, and takest no notice of the beam that is in thine own?

42. or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother let me take out the splinter that is in thine eye, when thou thyself seest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, first take out the beam from thine own eye, and then thou wilt see distinctly how to take out the chaff that is in thy brother's eye.

43. For that is not a good tree which produceth bad fruit, nor is the tree bad, which produceth good fruit:

44. for every tree is known by it's fruit; for men do not gather figs from thorns, nor grapes from a bramble.

45. A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man, out of the evil treasure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is evil: for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.

46. But why do ye call me, Lord, Lord, and do not practise what I teach you?

47. Whosoever cometh unto me, and heareth my instructions, and observeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:

48. he is like a man who in building an house digged deep, and laid the foundation upon a rock; and when a flood came, the torrent beat violently against that house, but could not shake it, for it was founded upon a rock.

49. But he that heareth and observeth not, is like a man that built an house upon the ground without any foundation, which the flood beat violently upon, and immediately it fell down, and the ruin of that house was great. 

## Luke 7

1. Now when He had finished his discourse in the audience of the people, He entered into Capernaum: and a certain centurion's servant,

2. whom he had a great value for, was ill and ready to die;

3. and having heard of Jesus, he sent unto Him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that He would come and heal his servant.

4. And when they came to Jesus, they intreated Him earnestly, saying, he is worthy of this favor:

5. for he loveth our nation, and hath built us a synagogue.

6. So Jesus went with them. And when He was now not far from the house, the centurion sent some of his friends to Him, saying Lord, trouble not thyself, for I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter under my roof:

7. neither did I think myself worthy to come unto thee. But speak the word, and my servant will be recovered.

8. For I also am a man placed under the authority of others, and have soldiers under me; and I say to one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doth it.

9. And when Jesus heard these things, He marvelled, and turning about, said to the multitude that followed Him, I declare unto you, I have not found so great faith, no not in Israel.

10. And when they that were sent, returned to the house, they found the servant well, that had been sick.

11. And the day after He went to a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with Him, and a great multitude besides:

12. and as He came near to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carrying out to be buried, his mother's only son, and she was a widow: and many of the people of the city were with her.

13. And when the Lord saw her, He was moved with compassion for her, and said to her, Do not weep.

14. And He came up and touched the bier, (and the bearers stopped,) and He said, Young man, I say unto thee, arise.

15. And the dead person sat up, and began to speak: and He delivered him to his mother.

16. And an awe seized them all, and they glorified God, saying, a great prophet is risen up among us, and God hath visited his people.

17. And this report of Him was spread through all Judea, and in all the country round about.

18. And the disciples of John told him of all these things: so John called two of his disciples to him,

19. and sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou He that was to come, or are we to expect another?

20. And the men came to Him, and said, John the baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou He that was to come, or are we to expect another?

21. (Now at that very time He cured many of their diseases and plagues, and of evil spirits, and gave sight to many that were blind.)

22. And Jesus answering said unto them, Go and tell John what ye have seen and heard: that the blind recover sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the gospel preached to them,

23. and happy is he who shall not be offended at any thing in me.

24. When the messengers of John were departed, He began to speak unto the people concerning John, what went ye out into the wilderness to see?

25. a reed shaken by the wind? but what did ye go out to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that are dressed in fine clothes and live delicately, are in palaces, not in deserts: but what went ye out to see?

26. a prophet? yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.

27. This is he of whom it is written, "Behold I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee:"

28. for I tell you that among the sons of men there is not a greater prophet than John the baptist: (though the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he:)

29. ---and all the people that heard him, even the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John;

30. but the pharisees indeed and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God within themselves, and were not baptized by him.---

31. Whereunto therefore shall I compare the men of this generation?

32. and to what are they like? they are like children sitting in the market-place, and calling to one another, and saying, "We have played pleasant tunes to you, and ye have not danced; we have sung mournful ones and ye have not wept:"

33. for John the baptist came neither eating bread, nor drinking wine, and ye say, he hath a demon:

34. the Son of man is come eating and drinking like other men, and ye call Him a gluttonous man and a wine bibber, and a friend of publicans and sinners.

35. But wisdom is justified by all her children.

36. And one of the pharisees asked Him to eat with him: and He went into the pharisee's house, and sat down.

37. And behold a woman in the city, that was a sinner, when she knew that He was at table in the pharisee's house,

38. brought an alabaster-box of ointment, and stood at his feet behind Him, weeping, and washed his feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.

39. But when the pharisee that invited Him saw it, he said within himself, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what sort of a woman this is that toucheth Him; for she is a notorious sinner.

40. And Jesus said unto him, Simon, I have something to say to thee: (and he replied, Master, say on.)

41. A certain creditor had two debtors, the one owed him five hundred denaries, and the other fifty:

42. and they not being able to pay him, he freely forgave them both: tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?

43. And Simon answered, I suppose he to whom he forgave most. And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged:

44. and turning to the woman, He said to Simon, Dost thou see this woman? I came into thine house, and thou gavest me no water for my feet; but she has bathed my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.

45. Thou gavest me not the respect of a kiss; but this woman, ever since she came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.

46. Thou didst not anoint my head with common oil, but she hath anointed even my feet with sweet ointment.

47. Wherefore, I tell thee, her sins though many are forgiven, for she loved much: but he to whom little is forgiven, loveth but little.

48. And He said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.

49. And they that sat at table with Him, said within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?

50. But He said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee, go in peace. 

## Luke 8

1. And it came to pass afterwards that He went through every city and village, preaching and declaring the good tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with Him;

2. and some women that had been cured of evil spirits and other infirmities, as Mary Magdalene, out of whom were cast seven demons,

3. and Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who assisted Him with their substance.

4. And when a great multitude was gathered together, of those that came to Him out of every city, He spake a parable saying,

5. A sower went out to sow his seed, and as he was sowing, some fell by the way-side, and was trodden down, and the birds of the air devoured it.

6. And some fell upon stony ground, and as soon as it sprung up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.

7. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it.

8. But some fell on good ground, and sprang up and yielded fruit an hundred-fold. And as He said these things He cried out, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."

9. And his disciples asked Him, what might be the meaning of this parable.

10. And He said, To you it is granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but I speak to others in parables, that in seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.

11. Now this is the meaning of the parable, The seed is the word of God:

12. and those by the way-side, are such as hear indeed; but then the devil cometh and taketh away the word from their hearts, least they should believe and be saved.

13. And those on stony-ground are such as when they hear, receive the word with joy; but have no root, and so believe only for a while, and in the time of trial fall away.

14. And that which fell among thorns, are those who when they have heard the word go away and are choked with the cares and riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to perfection.

15. But that on the good ground, are those who having heard the word, retain it in a good and honest heart, and bring forth fruit with patience.

16. No man when he hath lighted a candle covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a couch; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they who come in may see the light.

17. (For there is nothing secret, that shall not be made manifest: nor any thing concealed, which shall not be made known and come to light.)

18. Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever improveth what he hath, to him shall more be given; and whosoever hath not, even what he seemeth to have shall be taken from him.

19. Now his mother and his brethren came to Him, and could not come at Him for the croud:

20. and it was told Him, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without desiring to see thee.

21. And He answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of God and do it.

22. And it came to pass on one of the days that He went into a ship, Himself and his disciples, and He said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake.

23. And they launched forth: but as they were failing, He fell asleep: and a storm of wind came down upon the lake, and they were filled with water, and were in great danger.

24. And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying, Master, master, we are perishing. Then He arose and rebuked the wind, and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm.

25. And He said unto them, Where is your faith? But they were struck with awe and amazement, and said one to another, who is this? for He commandeth even the winds and the sea, and they obey Him.

26. And they sailed to the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.

27. And when He was landed, there met Him a man out of the city, who had been possessed by demons a long while, and wore no clothes, and abode in no dwelling but the tombs.

28. But when he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down to Him, and said with a loud voice, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I beseech thee, do not torment me.

29. (For He commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man; which had oftentimes seized him so violently, that tho' he was bound with chains and fetters, yet he broke the bands asunder, and was driven by the demon into those lonely places.)

30. And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? and he said, Legion: because many demons were entred into him.

31. And they besought Him that He would not command them to go into the abyss:

32. but as there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain, they intreated Him that He would suffer them to enter into them, and He permitted them.

33. So the demons went out of the man and entred into the swine: and the herd ran violently down the hill into the lake and were drowned.

34. And when those that looked after them saw what was done they fled; and went and told it in city and country:

35. and the people went out to see what was done, and came to Jesus; and found the man, from whom the demons were gone out, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind:

36. and they were afraid, for those that saw it told them how the demoniac was healed.

37. And all the people of the country round about the Gadarenes desired Him to depart from them; for they were seized with great fear: and He went into the ship and returned.

38. Now the man from whom the demons were gone out, prayed Him to let him be with Him: but Jesus sent him away,

39. saying, Return home, and relate what God hath done for thee. So he went away publishing through the whole city what great things Jesus had done to him.

40. And when Jesus returned, a great multitude of people received Him; for they were all waiting for Him.

41. And behold there came a man whose name was Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, and he fell at the feet of Jesus, and intreated Him to come into his house:

42. for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. (But as He was going, the people crouded Him:

43. and a woman who had been in a flux twelve years, and had spent her whole livelyhood upon physicians,

44. but could not be healed by any, came close behind Him and touched the hem of his garment, and immediately her flux was stopt.

45. And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied it, Peter, and those that were with him, said, Sir, the multitudes throng and press thee, and dost thou ask, Who was it that touched me?

46. And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive a peculiar virtue is gone out of me.

47. And when the woman saw that she was not concealed, she came trembling, and fell down to Him, and declared before all the people, for what reason she had touched Him, and how she was healed immediately.

48. And He said unto her, Daughter, be comforted, thy faith has healed thee, go in peace.)

49. While He was yet speaking, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's, and said to Him, Thy daughter is dead, trouble not the Master.

50. But Jesus hearing it, answered saying, Fear not, only believe, and she shall be recovered.

51. And when He came to the house, He suffered none to go in but Peter, and James, and John, and the father and mother of the child.

52. And they were all weeping and bewailing her: but He said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.

53. And they laughed at Him, knowing that she was dead.

54. But He turned them all out, and taking hold of her hand, called to her, saying, Child, arise.

55. And her spirit returned, and immediately she stood up: and He ordered something to be given her to eat.

56. And her parents were exceedingly astonished: but He charged them to tell no one what was done. 

## Luke 9

1. And He called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases:

2. and He sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.

3. And He said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; nor two coats a piece.

4. And into whatever house ye enter, continue there, till ye leave that place.

5. And whosoever will not receive you, when ye depart from that city, shake off the very dust from your feet, for a testimony against them.

6. And they went from town to town, preaching the gospel and healing every where.

7. Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things that were done by Him; and was perplexed, because it was said by some that John was risen from the dead;

8. and by some that Elias had appeared; and by others, that one of the ancient prophets was risen again.

9. And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? and he wanted to see Him.

10. And the apostles; when they were returned, told Him all that they had done: and He took them and retired privately into a desert place belonging to the city Bethsaida.

11. But when the people knew it they followed Him; and He received them, and spake to them concerning the kingdom of God, and healed those that had need of a cure.

12. And when the day began to decline, the twelve came and said to Him, Dismiss the people, that they may go into the villages and country-places round about, and bait, and get food: for here we are in a desert place.

13. But He said unto them, Do ye give them food. And they said, We have but five loaves and two fishes: unless we should go and buy provisions for all this people:

14. for they were about five thousand men. And He said to his disciples, Make them sit down in companies by fifty.

15. And they did so, and caused them all to sit down.

16. And He took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven He blessed them; and brake and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.

17. And they did eat, and were all satisfied: and there was taken up what remained even of fragments twelve baskets.

18. And it came to pass, as He was praying in private, his disciples were with Him: and He asked them saying, Whom say the people that I am?

19. They answering said, John the baptist: but others say Elias: and others, that some ancient prophet is risen again.

20. And He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answered and said, The Christ the Son of God.

21. But He strictly charged and commanded them to tell this to no one,

22. saying, the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and scribes, and be put to death, and be raised again the third day.

23. And He said unto them all, if any one is willing to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me:

24. for he that would save his life shall lose it, but he that would lose his life for my sake shall save it.

25. For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be destroyed?

26. For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when He comes in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.

27. And I assure you, there be some of those who stand here, that shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God.

28. About eight days after these discourses, He took Peter, and John, and James, and went up to a mountain to pray.

29. And as He was praying the form of his countenance was altered, and his raiment white and glistering:

30. and behold two men talked with Him, which were Moses and Elias;

31. who appeared in glory, and spake of his exit, which He was to make at Jerusalem.

32. Now Peter and they that were with Him were heavy with sleep; but being awakened they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with Him.

33. And as they were departing from Him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here, let us make three tabernacles, one for Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.

34. And as he was saying this, there came a cloud and overshadowed them; and they were afraid, when they went up into the cloud and disappeared.

35. And there came a voice out of the cloud saying, This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him.

36. And when the voice was uttered, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it to themselves, and told no one at that time any of the things which they had seen.

37. And the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a great multitude met Him:

38. and one of the people cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee look upon my son, for he is my only child;

39. and lo, a spirit seizeth him, and all on a sudden he screameth, and it convulses him with foaming; and bruising him, with much ado departs from him.

40. And I prayed thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not.

41. Then Jesus answered and said, O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? Bring thy son hither.

42. And as he was coming along, the devil bruised and convulsed him: but Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him to his father.

43. And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God: but while they were all wondering at the things which Jesus did, He said to his disciples,

44. Receive these words into your ears; for the Son of man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.

45. But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, so that they perceived it not, and they were afraid to ask Him concerning it.

46. Then a dispute rose among them, which of them should be greatest.

47. And Jesus knowing the thought of their heart, took a child and set him by Him, and said unto them,

48. Whosoever shall receive this little child for my sake, receiveth me: and he that receiveth me, receiveth Him that sent me. For he that is lest among you all, shall be great.

49. And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name, and we forbad him, because he followeth not thee with us.

50. And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not; for he, that is not against us, is for us.

51. And it came to pass, as the days were almost fulfilled of his being received up again into heaven, that He set his face to go to Jerusalem,

52. and sent messengers before Him: who went into a village of the Samaritans to get a place ready for Him.

53. But they would not entertain Him, because his face was towards Jerusalem.

54. And when his disciples James and John saw it, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them, as Elias did?

55. But He turned and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what spirit ye are of:

56. for the Son of man came not to destroy mens lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.

57. And as they were going by the way, there was one said to Him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest:

58. and Jesus answered him, The foxes have holes, and the fowls of heaven their nests, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.

59. And He said to another, Follow me: but he said, Lord, permit me to go first and bury my father:

60. but Jesus said unto him, Leave the dead to bury their dead; but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.

61. And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee, but allow me first to go and take my leave of my family.

62. But Jesus said unto him, No one, that hath put his hand to the plough and looketh back, is fit for the kingdom of God. 

## Luke 10

1. After these things the Lord appointed also seventy others, and sent them two and two before Him, into every city and place, whither He himself was about to come.

2. And He said unto them, The harvest indeed is great, but the laborers are few: pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that He would send out workmen to his harvest.

3. Go your ways: behold I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves.

4. Carry neither purse, nor bag, nor shoes; and salute no one by the way.

5. But whatever house ye come into, first say, Peace be to this house:

6. and if there be a child of peace there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall return upon yourselves.

7. But remain in the same house, eating and drinking such as they have; for the laborer is worthy of his hire.

8. Go not from house to house. And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you;

9. and heal those in it that are sick, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come unto you.

10. But into whatever city ye come, and they receive you not, go out into the streets of it and say,

11. even the dust that cleaveth to us out of your city we wipe off against you: but know this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.

12. And I tell you, it shall be more tolerable in that day even for Sodom than for that city.

13. Wo unto thee, Chorazin, wo unto thee, Bethsaida, for if the miracles wrought among you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would long ago have repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.

14. But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgement than for you.

15. And thou Capernaum, which art exalted even to heaven, shalt be cast down to hell.

16. ---He, that heareth you, heareth me; and he, that rejecteth you, rejecteth me; and he, that rejecteth me, rejecteth Him that sent me.

17. And the seventy returned with joy saying, Lord, even the devils are subject to us through thy name.

18. And He said unto them, I beheld Satan, as lightning, falling from heaven.

19. Behold I give you power to trample upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the might of the enemy; and nothing shall at all hurt you.

20. However rejoice not in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice that your names are written in heaven.

21. At this time Jesus was transported with joy in his spirit and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and knowing, and hast revealed them to babes: even so, Father, for such was thy good pleasure.

22. All things are delivered to me by my Father: and none knoweth who the Son is, but the Father: and who the Father is, but the Son; and he to whom the Son pleaseth to reveal Him.

23. And turning to the disciples, He said to them in particular, Blessed are the eyes that see what ye see:

24. for many prophets and kings desired to see the things which ye see, and did not see them; and to hear what ye hear, but did not hear them.

25. And behold, a lawyer stood up to try Him, and said, Master, what must I do to inherit eternal life?

26. He said to him, What is written in the law? How readest thou there?

27. And he answered, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind: and thy neighbor as thyself.

28. And He said unto him, Thou hast answered right; do this and thou shalt live.

29. But he willing to justify himself said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor?

30. And Jesus replying said, There was a certain man going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among thieves, who after they had stripped and beaten him, went away, leaving him half dead.

31. And by chance a certain priest came down that way, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.

32. Likewise a Levite also, when he came to the place, went and looked at him, and then crossed the way and passed by.

33. But a certain Samaritan, as he was travelling, came up to him, and when He saw him,

34. he was moved with compassion, and went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine; and setting him upon his own beast, brought him to an inn and took care of him.

35. And on the morrow, when he went away he took out two denaries, and gave them to the inn-keeper, and said to him, Take care of him, and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again I will repay thee.

36. Which now of these three dost thou think was neighbor to him that fell among the thieves?

37. And he said, He that took pity on him. Therefore said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou in like manner.

38. And as they were journeying, He entered into a certain village; and a woman named Martha received Him into her house.

39. And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the feet of Jesus, attending to his discourse.

40. But Martha, being perplexed about much serving, came to Him and said, Lord, dost thou not regard it, that my sister has left me to serve alone? speak to her therefore that she may help me.

41. And Jesus said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and in a hurry about many things: but one thing is necessary.

42. And Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her. 

## Luke 11

1. And as He was praying in a certain retired place, as soon as He had done, one of his disciples said to Him, Lord, teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples.

2. And He said unto them, when ye pray, say, "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done as in heaven so also upon earth;

3. give us day by day our daily bread; and forgive us our sins,

4. for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one."

5. And He said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves; for a friend of mine on his journey is come to me,

6. and I have nothing to set before him:

7. and he from within shall answer and say, Do not be troublesome; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed, I cannot rise to give thee.

8. I tell you, tho' he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend: yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he wants.

9. And so I tell you, Ask and it shall be given you, seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you.

10. For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

11. If a son ask bread of any father among you, will he give him a stone? and if he ask for a fish, will he instead of a fish give him a serpent? or if he ask for an egg,

12. will he give him a scorpion?

13. If ye then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask Him?

14. And He was casting out a demon, and it was dumb: and when the demon was gone out, the dumb man spake; and the people wondered.

15. But some of them said, He casteth out demons by Beelzebub the prince of demons:

16. and others, to try Him, desired of Him a sign from heaven.

17. But He who well knew their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself becomes desolate, and a house against a house falleth: if Satan also be divided against himself,

18. how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say, that I cast out demons by Beelzebub.

19. And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your own people cast them out? wherefore they shall be your judges.

20. But if I cast out demons by the power of God, you may be sure the kingdom of God is come unto you:

21. for when a strong man well-armed defends his palace, his substance is secure:

22. but when a stronger than he cometh upon him and conquers him, he taketh away his armour, wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.

23. He, that is not with me, is against me; and he, that gathereth not with me, scattereth.

24. When an impure spirit is gone out of a man, he wanders through dry desert places, seeking rest: and finding none he saith, I will return into my house, that I came out of;

25. and when he cometh he findeth it swept and set in order.

26. Then he goeth and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and so the last state of that man is worse than the first.

27. As He was speaking these things, a certain woman lifted up her voice from amidst the croud, and said, Happy is the womb that bare thee, and the breasts which thou didst suck!

28. but He replied, Yea rather happy are they, that hear the word of God and keep it.

29. And when the multitudes were gathering thick together He began to say, This is a wicked generation: they demand a sign, but no sign shall be given them, except that of the prophet Jonah:

30. for as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.

31. The queen of the south shall rise up in the day of judgement against the men of this generation and condemn them: for she came from the remote parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold a greater than Solomon is here.

32. And the men of Nineveh shall rise up in the judgement against this generation, and condemn it; for they repented upon the preaching of Jonas, and behold a greater than Jonas is here.

33. But yet no one having lighted a candle putteth it into a secret place, nor under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they who come in may see the light.

34. The eye is the candle of the body: therefore when thine eye is clear, thy whole body also is light; but when it is bad, thy body also is dark.

35. Take heed therefore least the light which is in thee be darkness.

36. For if thy whole body be light, having no part dark, it will be (when all enlightened) as when a candle giveth thee light by its brightness.

37. And as He spake, a certain pharisee asked Him to dine with him: and He went in and sat down at table.

38. And when the pharisee saw it he wondered that He did not wash first, before dinner.

39. But the Lord said unto him, ye pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of rapine and wickedness.

40. Senseless creatures! Did not He who made the outside, make also that which is within? give alms rather according to your ability:

41. and behold all things are clean to you.

42. But wo unto you pharisees, who tithe even your mint, and rue, and all your herbs, and pass by judgement and the love of God: these ought ye to practise and not to omit the others.

43. Wo unto you pharisees; for ye love the chief seat in synagogues, and salutations in public places.

44. Wo unto you scribes and pharisees, hypocrites; for ye are like graves that do not appear, and those that walk over them are not aware of them.

45. And one of the doctors of the law answered and said unto Him, Master, in saying these things thou reproachest us also.

46. And He said, Wo unto you also, ye interpreters of the law, for ye load men with insupportable burthens, and ye yourselves touch not the burthens with one of your fingers.

47. Wo unto you; who build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.

48. Thus ye testify that ye approve of the deeds of your fathers; for they put them to death, and ye build their sepulchres.

49. And therefore the wisdom of God hath said, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and persecute:

50. that the blood of all the prophets which has been shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation, from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah,

51. who perished between the altar and the temple. Verily I tell you, it shall be required of this generation.

52. Wo unto you interpreters of the law; for ye have taken away the key of knowledge, ye entered not in yourselves, and those that were entering in, ye hindered.

53. As He was saying these things unto them the scribes and pharisees began vehemently to attack Him, and urge Him to speak of many things,

54. laying snares for Him, and endeavouring to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse Him. 

## Luke 12

1. In the mean time great multitudes of people being gathered together about Him, so that they trode upon one another, He began to say to his disciples, Beware of the leaven of the pharisees, which is hypocrisy: for there is nothing concealed,

2. which shall not be discovered; nor hidden which shall not be known.

3. Therefore whatsoever ye have said in darkness shall be heard in the light: and what ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed on the house-tops.

4. Now I say unto you, my friends, Be not afraid of them, that can only kill the body, and after that have nothing more that they can do.

5. But I will shew you whom ye should fear,---Fear Him, who after He hath killed, hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, fear Him.

6. Are not five sparrows sold for two assaries, and not one of them is forgotten before God.

7. Nay the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Be not therefore afraid; ye are of more worth than many sparrows.

8. But I say unto you, Whosoever shall own me before men, the Son of man will also own him before the angels of God.

9. But he, that disowneth me before men, shall be disowned before the angels of God.

10. And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it may be forgiven him; but unto him, that blasphemeth the holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven.

11. And when they bring you before the synagogues, and magistrates, and powers, be not solicitous how or what defence to make, or what to say:

12. for the holy Spirit shall teach you at that very time what ye ought to say.

13. And one among the multitude said to Him, Master, speak to my brother to divide the inheritance with me: but He said unto him,

14. Man, who set me over you as a judge or divider?

15. And He said unto them, See to it that ye beware of covetousness; for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of his possessions.

16. And He spake a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:

17. and he reasoned within himself, saying, What shall I do? for I have not room to lay up my corn.

18. And he said, This I will do: I will pull down my barns, and build larger ones; and there I will bestow all my products and my goods.

19. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast plenty of goods laid up for many years, take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.

20. But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee; then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?

21. So is he that heapeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich towards God.

22. And He said to his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat; nor for the body, what ye shall put on:

23. the life is more than food, and the body than raiment.

24. Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap; they have neither store-house nor barn, and yet God feedeth them: how much more worth are ye than the fowls?

25. And which of you by all his thought can add one moment to his life?

26. If then ye cannot do even the lest, why are ye so anxious about the rest?

27. Consider the lilies, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I tell you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

28. Now if God so clothe the grass which is to day in the field, and to-morrow is cast into the furnace, how much more will He clothe you, O ye of little faith?

29. And seek ye not what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; neither be ye in careful suspense:

30. for all these things the nations of the world seek after; but your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.

31. Seek ye therefore the kingdom of God, and all these shall be super-added unto you.

32. Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's pleasure to give you the kingdom.

33. Sell what ye have, and give alms: provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a never-failing treasure in the heavens, where no thief approacheth nor moth corrupteth:

34. for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

35. Let your loins be girt, and your lights burning, and

36. ye yourselves like men waiting for their lord's return from a wedding, that they may immediately open the door to him, when he comes and knocks.

37. Happy are those servants, whom the master when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he will gird himself, and make them sit down, and will come and serve them.

38. And if he come in the second watch, or in the third watch, and find them so, happy indeed are those servants.

39. And this ye know, that if the master of a house had known at what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broke open:

40. therefore be ye also ready; for the Son of man cometh at a season that ye think not of.

41. Then said Peter unto Him, Lord, dost thou speak this parable to us only, or to all others likewise?

42. And the Lord said, Who is indeed that faithful and wise steward, whom his master will set over his family to give out the measure of food in due season?

43. Happy is that servant, whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing.

44. Verily I tell you, that he will set him over all that he hath.

45. But if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and begin to beat the men and maid-servants, and drink, and to be drunken:

46. the lord of that servant will come on a day in which he does not expect him, and at a time which he is not aware of; and will cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the unfaithful.

47. And that servant, who knew his master's will, and did not prepare himself to do according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes;

48. but he that knew it not, and did things deserving stripes, shall be beaten with few: for to whomsoever much is given, of him will much be required; and to whom men have committed much, of him they will demand the more.

49. I am come to send fire on the earth, and how do I desire that it were already kindled?

50. for I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am straitened till it be accomplished?

51. Do ye think that I am come to give peace on the earth? I tell you, nay; but rather division.

52. For from this time there shall be five in one family divided, three against two and two against three:

53. the father will be against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.

54. He said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rising from the west, ye presently say, there is a shower coming, and so it proves:

55. and when ye observe the south-wind blowing, ye say there will be heat, and it cometh to pass.

56. Ye hypocrites, ye know how to discern the face of the earth and of the heavens, and why do ye not discern the present time?

57. and why do ye not even of yourselves judge what is right?

58. When thou art going with thine adversary to the magistrate, endeavour while thou art in the way to be discharged, least he force thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer carry thee to prison.

59. I tell thee, thou shalt not come out from thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite. 

## Luke 13

1. There were present at the same time, some that told Him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.

2. And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye think that these were sinners above all the Galileans, because they suffered such things?

3. I tell you, No: but, unless ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

4. Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them, do ye think that they were sinners above all the inhabitants in Jerusalem?

5. I tell you, No: but, unless ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

6. And He spake this parable, A certain man had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, but found none.

7. And he said to the vine-dresser, behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree, and find none: cut it down, why should it cumber the ground?

8. And he said to him, Sir, let it alone this year also, till I dig about it, and lay dung to it:

9. then perhaps it may bear fruit; if not, afterwards cut it down.

10. And when He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath-day,

11. there was a woman that had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and utterly unable to lift herself upright.

12. And when Jesus saw her, He called her to Him, and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.

13. And He laid his hands upon her; and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.

14. But the ruler of the synagogue, being provoked that Jesus had wrought a cure on the sabbath-day, said to the people, There are six days in which ye ought to work; on these therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath-day.

15. The Lord therefore answered him and said, Thou hypocrite, does not any of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall and lead him away to watering?

16. And might not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath-day?

17. Upon his saying this, all his adversaries were ashamed: but the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by Him.

18. Then said He, To what is the kingdom of God like, and to what shall I compare it?

19. It is like a grain of mustard-seed, which a man took and sowed in his garden, and it grew, and became a great tree, and the birds of the air lodged in it's boughs.

20. And again He said, To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?

21. It is like leaven, which a woman took and put into three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

22. And he went through the cities and villages teaching, as He journeyed towards Jerusalem.

23. And one said to Him, Lord, are there but few that shall be saved?

24. But He said unto them, Strive to enter in at the strait gate; for I tell you, many will desire to enter in, and shall not be able.

25. When the master of the house shall have risen up and shut the door, and ye begin to stand without and knock at the door saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and He shall answer and say to you, I know you not, whence ye are:

26. then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drank in thy presence,

27. and thou hast taught in our streets, But He will say, I tell you, I know you not, whence ye are; depart from me all ye workers of iniquity:

28. and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves shut out.

29. Yea they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.

30. And behold, there are some last who shall be first, and there are first that shall be last.

31. At the same time came some of the pharisees, and said to Him, Go out and depart hence, for Herod intends to kill thee.

32. And He said to them, Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and to-morrow; and in a little while I am to be perfected:

33. but I must procede to-day and to-morrow and the following; for it cannot be supposed that a prophet should be cut off but in Jerusalem.

34. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and ye would not?

35. Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and I assure you ye shall not see me again till the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord. 

## Luke 14

1. And as He went into the house of one of the chief of the pharisees to eat on the sabbath-day, and they were watching Him,

2. behold, there was a certain man before Him that had a dropsy.

3. And Jesus spake to the expounders of the law and to the pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath-day?

4. but they made no answer. And He took him and healed him, and sent him away:

5. and said unto them, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fall into a pit, and will not immediately draw him out even on the sabbath-day?

6. and they were not able to answer Him again to these things.

7. And He spake a parable to those that were invited, observing how they chose the chief seats, saying unto them,

8. When thou art invited by any one to a wedding, do not sit down in the uppermost place, least one more honorable than thou be invited by him;

9. and he who invited thee and him, should come and say to thee, Give place to this person, and then thou begin with shame to take the lowest place.

10. But when thou art invited, go and sit down at the lowest place, that, when he who invited thee cometh, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then wilt thou have honor before them that sit at table with thee:

11. for whosoever exalteth himself shall be humbled, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

12. He said also to him that had invited Him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, do not invite thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kindred, nor thy rich neighbors; least they invite thee again, and so a return be made thee.

13. But when thou makest a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind; and thou shalt be happy;

14. because they have not wherewith to requite thee: for a recompense shall be given thee at the resurrection of the just.

15. And one of those; who sat at table with Him, hearing these things, said unto Him, Happy is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.

16. Upon which He said, A certain man made a great supper and invited many;

17. and sent his servant at supper-time to say to them that were invited, Come, for all things are now ready.

18. And they all with one consent began to make excuses; the first said, I have bought a field, and I must go and see it, pray have me excused.

19. And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and am going to try them, pray have me excused.

20. And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.

21. So the servant came and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go directly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the lame, and the blind.

22. And the servant said, Sir, it is done according to thine order, and still there is room.

23. And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the high-ways and hedges, and press them to come in, that my house may be filled:

24. for I tell you, that none of those men who were invited, shall taste of my supper.

25. Now there were great multitudes going along with Him:

26. so he turned and said to them, If any man come to me, and does not comparatively hate his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea and his own life too, he cannot be my disciple.

27. And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and follow me, cannot be my disciple.

28. For who of you that hath a mind to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the expence, whether he hath wherewithal to perfect it?

29. least having laid a foundation and not being able to finish,

30. all that see it, should deride him, saying, this man began to build and was not able to finish.

31. Or what king, going to engage with another king in battle, doth not sit down first and consult, whether he be able with ten thousand men to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?

32. and if not, while he is yet far off, he sendeth an embassy, and desireth conditions of peace.

33. So, every one of you, that doth not give up all that he hath, cannot be my disciple.

34. Salt is good; but if the salt have lost it's savor, wherewith shall it be seasoned?

35. it is neither fit for the land, nor for the dunghil; but they throw it away. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. 

## Luke 15

1. Then drew near unto Him all the publicans and other notorious sinners, to hear Him.

2. And the pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man entertaineth wicked persons, and eateth with them.

3. But He spake to them this parable,

4. saying, What man of you that hath an hundred sheep, and loseth one of them, doth not leave the ninety-nine in the field, and go after that which was lost, till he find it?

5. And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing:

6. and coming home, he calleth his friends and neighbors together and saith unto them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.

7. Thus, I tell you, there shall be joy in heaven over one repenting sinner, more than over ninety-nine righteous persons, that have no need of repentance.

8. Or what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and search carefully till she find it?

9. and when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and neighbors together; saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I had lost.

10. Thus, I tell you, there is joy among the angels of God over one repenting sinner.

11. And He said, a certain man had two sons: and the younger of them said to his father,

12. Father, give me the portion that falleth to my share. And he divided his substance between them.

13. And not many days after the younger son gathered all together and went abroad into a distant country, and there squandered away his substance by living luxuriously.

14. And when he had spent all, there happen'd a grievous famine in that country, and he began to be in want.

15. And he went and let himself to one of the people of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed swine.

16. And he would gladly have filled his belly with the husks which the swine did eat: and no man relieved him.

17. But coming to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father have bread enough and to spare, and I am perishing with hunger?

18. I will rise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee,

19. and am no longer worthy to be called thy son; make me as one of thy hired servants.

20. And he rose and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion; and he ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.

21. And his son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee, and am no longer worthy to be called thy son.

22. But the father said to his servants, bring out the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:

23. and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and be merry:

24. for this my son was dead, and is alive again, and was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.

25. But his elder son was out in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing:

26. and he called one of the servants to him, and asked what these things meant.

27. And he said to him, Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and well: but he was angry, and would not go in.

28. Therefore his father came out and desired him.

29. But he answered and said to his father, Behold so many years as I serve thee, nor have I ever transgressed thy command, and yet thou hast never given me a kid, to be merry with my friends:

30. but as soon as this thy son was come, who hath eaten up thy substance with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.

31. And he said unto him, Son, thou art always with me, and all that I have is thine.

32. But it was fit we should be merry and rejoice; for this thy brother was dead, and is come to life again, was lost and is found. 

## Luke 16

1. And He said also to his disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and he was accused to him of wasting his goods.

2. And he called him, and said unto him, What is this I hear of thee? give up the accounts of thy stewardship, for thou canst be no longer steward.

3. And the steward said in himself, What shall I do? now my master takes away the stewardship from me; I am not able to work, and I am ashamed to beg.

4. I know what I will do, that when I am turned out of my place, they may receive me into their houses.

5. So he called his master's debtors to him, and said to the first, How much owest thou to my master? and he said, an hundred baths of oil.

6. And he said to him, Take thy bill, and sit down and write but fifty.

7. Then he said to another, And how much owest thou? and he said, an hundred measures of wheat: and he said to him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.

8. And his master commended the dishonest steward as having acted prudently: for the men of this world are as to their affairs wiser than the children of light.

9. And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends with these unrighteous treasures, that when they fail, ye may be received into everlasting habitations.

10. He, that is faithful in the lest, is faithful also in much: and he, that is unjust in the lest, is unjust also in much.

11. If therefore ye have not been faithful in the false riches, who will intrust you with the true?

12. and if ye have not been faithful in that which was another's, who will give you that which is your own?

13. No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or at lest he will be attached to the one, and neglect the other. Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.

14. And the pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things; and derided Him.

15. And He said unto them, Ye justify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.

16. The law and the prophets continued until John: from that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every one presseth into it.

17. Though it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than one tittle of the law to fail.

18. Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.

19. Now there was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, living voluptuously and splendidly every day.

20. And there was a poor man named Lazarus,

21. who was laid at his gate full of sores, and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table: and the dogs came and licked his sores. And it came to pass that the poor man died,

22. and was carried by angels to Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried.

23. And in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham from afar, and Lazarus in his bosom.

24. And he cried out and said, Father Abraham, have pity on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.

25. And Abraham said, Son, remember that thou receivedst thy good things in thy life-time, and likewise Lazarus his evils: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.

26. And besides, there is a great gulf fixed between us and you; so that they, who would pass from hence to you, cannot; nor can they pass to us, who would come from thence.

27. Then he said, Therefore I intreat thee, Father, that thou wouldst send him to my father's house:

28. for I have five brethren; that he may testify to them my misery, least they also come into this place of torment.

29. Abraham answered him, They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them:

30. and he said, Nay, father Abraham, but if one went to them from the dead, they will repent.

31. And he replied, If they hearken not to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one should rise from the dead. 

## Luke 17

1. Then said He to the disciples, It is impossible that offences should not come: but wo to him by whom they come.

2. It were better for him that a milstone were hung about his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to offend.

3. Take heed to yourselves: if thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.

4. And if he trespass against thee seven times a day, and seven times in a day return to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.

5. And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.

6. And the Lord said, If ye had faith but as a grain of mustard-seed, ye might say to this sycamine-tree, Be thou rooted up and planted in the sea; and it would obey you.

7. But which of you having a servant plowing, or feeding cattle, will say to him, as soon as he comes in from the field, Come hither and sit down at table?

8. But will he not rather say to him, Get ready my supper, and gird thyself, and wait upon me, till I have done, and afterwards thou shalt eat and drink.

9. Is he obliged to that servant for doing what he was ordered?

10. I think not. So likewise ye, when ye have done all things that were commanded you, say we are unprofitable servants, for we have done only what we ought to do.

11. And as He was going to Jerusalem, He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee;

12. and as He entered into a certain village, there met Him ten men that were lepers:

13. who stood at a distance, and lifted up their voice, saying, Jesus master, have pity on us.

14. And when He saw them, He said unto them, Go and shew yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass as they were going, they were cleansed.

15. And one of them, perceiving that he was healed, returned, with a loud voice glorifying God:

16. and fell prostrate at his feet, giving Him thanks; and He was a Samaritan.

17. And Jesus answered and said, Were not all the ten cleansed? and where are the other nine?

18. Are there none returning to give glory to God, but this stranger?

19. And He said to him, Arise, go thy way; thy faith hath saved thee.

20. And being asked by the pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, He answered and said, the kingdom of God cometh not with observation.

21. Neither shall they say, Behold it is here, or behold it is there; for the kingdom of God is within you.

22. And He said to the disciples, the time will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and shall not see it.

23. And they will say to you, Behold, He is here, or behold He is there: but go not after them, nor follow them.

24. For as the lightning which lightneth from the one part of heaven shineth to the other: so also shall the Son of man be in his day.

25. But He must suffer many things first, and be rejected by this generation.

26. And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.

27. They were eating, drinking, marrying, and being married, till the day that Noah went into the ark: and the flood came and destroyed them all.

28. And as it was likewise in the days of Lot; they were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, and building:

29. but the very day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.

30. Thus shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed.

31. In that day, whoever shall be on the house-top, and his goods in the house, let him not come down into it to take them away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.

32. Remember Lot's wife. Whosoever shall seek to save his life, shall lose it;

33. and whosoever will venture his life, shall preserve it.

34. In that night there shall be two in one bed; the one shall be taken and the other left:

35. two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken and the other left:

36. two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken and the other left.

37. And they answered and said unto Him, Where, Lord? And He said to them, where the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together. 

## Luke 18

1. And He spake also a parable to them, to shew that men ought always to pray, and not to faint:

2. saying, There was a judge in a certain city, who neither feared God, nor regarded man.

3. And there was a widow in that city, who came to him, saying, Do me justice of my adversary.

4. And he would not for a time: but afterwards he said within himself, Though I fear not God,

5. nor regard man, yet because this widow gives me trouble, I will do her justice, least by continually coming she weary me out.

6. And the Lord said, hear what even the unjust judge saith:

7. and will not God do justice for his elect that cry to Him day and night, though He bear long with them.

8. I tell you, He will avenge them speedily. And yet when the Son of man cometh, shall He find faith in the land?

9. And He spake also this parable to some that trusted in themselves as being righteous, and despised others.

10. Two men went up to the temple to pray; the one a pharisee and the other a publican.

11. The pharisee standing by himself prayed thus, O God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are, rapacious, unjust, adulterous, or even as this publican.

12. I fast twice a week, and I give tithes of all that I possess.

13. But the publican standing at a distance did not presume so much as to lift up his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, O God, be merciful to me a sinner.

14. I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for whoever exalteth himself shall be abased, but he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

15. And they brought to Him infants also, that He might touch them: and his disciples seeing it rebuked them.

16. But Jesus called them to Him and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.

17. Verily I tell you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall by no means enter into it.

18. And a certain ruler asked Him, saying, Good master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

19. And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is God.

20. Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.

21. And he said, all these have I kept from my youth.

22. But when Jesus heard these things He said unto him, Thou yet wantest one thing, Sell all that thou hast, and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.

23. But when he heard this, he was very sorrowful; for he was very rich.

24. And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, He said, How difficultly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God?

25. For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

26. And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?

27. But He answered, Things impossible with men are possible with God.

28. Then said Peter, Behold, we have quitted all, and followed Thee.

29. And He said unto them, Verily I tell you, there is no one that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,

30. who shall not receive manifold more even in this life, and in the world to come life everlasting.

31. And He took the twelve with Him and said to them, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.

32. For He shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and insulted, and abused, and spit upon, and they will scourge Him, and put Him to death:

33. and the third day He shall rise again.

34. But they understood none of these things; and this matter was hid from them, so that they knew not the things which were spoken.

35. And as he was near to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way-side begging.

36. And hearing a multitude passing by, he asked what it meant.

37. And they told him, Jesus of Nazareth is coming by.

38. And he cried out, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have compassion on me.

39. And they, that went before, rebuked him, that he might hold his peace, but he cried out the more, O Son of David, have pity on me.

40. So Jesus stopt, and ordered him to be brought to Him: and when he was come near,

41. He asked him, saying, What wouldst thou that I should do for thee? And he said, Lord, that I may recover my sight.

42. And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.

43. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God. 

## Luke 19

1. And Jesus having entred Jericho passed through the city,

2. and behold, there was a man named Zaccheus, who was the chief publican, and very rich.

3. And he sought to see Jesus who He was; but he could not for the croud; for he was little of stature.

4. And he ran before and got up into a sycamore-tree that he might see Him; for He was to pass by that way.

5. And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him, Zaccheus, make haste and come down; for to-day I must abide at thy house.

6. And he made haste and came down, and received Him with joy.

7. And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He is gone to be guest with a wicked man.

8. But Zaccheus stood up and said unto Jesus, Behold, Lord, the half of my substance I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any one wrongfully, I restore him fourfold.

9. Then said Jesus, This day is salvation come to this house, for as much as he also is a son of Abraham.

10. For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.

11. And as they listened to these things, He proceeded and spake a parable; because He was nigh to Jerusalem, and they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately be manifested.

12. He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a distant country to receive the investiture of a kingdom and then to return.

13. And he called ten of his servants, and delivered to them ten pounds, and said, Trade with them till I come.

14. But his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.

15. And when he was returned, having received the kingdom, he ordered these servants to be called to him, to whom he had delivered the money, that he might know what use each had made of it.

16. Then came the first and said, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.

17. And he said to him, Well done, thou good servant, as thou hast been faithful in a very little, thou shalt be governor over ten cities.

18. And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath produced five pounds:

19. and he said to this likewise, Be thou also over five cities.

20. And another came, and said, Behold, my Lord, thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:

21. for I was afraid of thee, because thou art an austere man, who takest up what thou didst not lay down, and reapest what thou didst not sow.

22. But he said to him, Out of thy own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant, Thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping what I did not sow;

23. and why then didst thou not put my money into the bank, that when I came I might have received it with interest?

24. And he said to them that stood by, Take away the pound from him, and give it to him that hath the ten pounds.

25. (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds already:)

26. for I tell you, that to every one that hath shall be given; but from him that hath not, even what he seemingly hath shall be taken away.

27. But those mine enemies, who would not have me to reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.

28. And when He had said these things, He went forward, going up to Jerusalem.

29. And when He was nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, He sent two of his disciples,

30. saying, Go into the opposite village, in which, at your entring, ye will find a colt tied, on which no man ever yet sat; loose him and bring him hither.

31. And if any one ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, The Lord hath need of him.

32. And they that were sent, went away and found it as He had told them.

33. But as they were untying the colt, the owners of it said to them, Why do ye untie the colt?

34. and they answered, The Lord hath need of him.

35. And they brought him to Jesus: and throwing their garments upon the colt they set Jesus thereon.

36. And as He went along they spread their clothes under Him in the way.

37. And when He was now come near to the foot of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples rejoicing began to praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen,

38. saying, Blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest!

39. And some of the pharisees from among the multitude said to Him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.

40. And He answered them, I tell you, that if these were silent, the very stones would cry out.

41. And as He drew near, beholding the city, He wept over it,

42. saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at lest in this thy day, the things relating to thy peace--- but now they are hid from thine eyes.

43. For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast up a trench about thee, and surround thee, and keep thee in on every side,

44. and shall lay thee to the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another: because thou didst not regard the time of thy visitation.

45. And He went into the temple, and cast out those that were buying and selling in it,

46. saying unto them, It is written, "my house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves."

47. And He was teaching daily in the temple: but the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people sought to destroy Him;

48. and could not find how to effect it: for all the people were attentive to hear Him. 

## Luke 20

1. And on one of those days as He was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes and elders came upon Him, saying,

2. Tell us by what authority thou dost these things? or who it is that gave thee this authority?

3. And He answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one question, tell me,

4. Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?

5. And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, He will say, Why then did ye not believe him?

6. but if we say, Of men, the people will all stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.

7. And they answered, they did not know whence it was.

8. And Jesus said unto them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.

9. Then He began to speak unto the people this parable, A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen and travelled abroad for a considerable time,

10. and at the fruit-season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard; but the husbandmen beat him and sent him away empty.

11. And he sent another servant; and they beat him also and abused him, and sent him away empty.

12. And he sent a third; and they wounded him also and drove him out.

13. Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: perhaps when they see Him they will reverence Him.

14. But when the husbandmen saw Him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir, come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.

15. So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do unto them?

16. He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. And when they heard this they said, God forbid.

17. And He looked upon them and said, What then is this, which is written, The stone which the builders refused, is become the head of the corner?

18. Whosoever falleth on that stone shall be bruised; but on whomsoever it falleth, it will crush him to pieces.

19. And the chief priests and the scribes would have laid hands on Him at that very time, but were afraid of the people: for they perceived that He had spoken this parable against them.

20. And they watched Him and sent out spies, pretending to be righteous men, to lay hold of his words, that they might deliver Him up to the power and authority of the governor.

21. And they asked Him, saying, Master, we know that thou speakest and teachest rightly, and acceptest not the person of any, but teachest the way of God in truth:

22. is it lawful for us to give tribute to Cesar, or not?

23. But He perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why do ye tempt me?

24. Shew me a penny: whose image and inscription hath it? and they answered, Cesar's.

25. Then said He unto them, Render therefore unto Cesar the things that are Cesar's, and to God the things that are God's.

26. And they could not take hold of his word before the people: and they marvelled at his answer and said no more.

27. And some of the Sadducees (who deny a resurrection) came to Him and asked Him,

28. saying, Moses enjoined us, if any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die childless, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.

29. Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died childless; and the second took the wife, and he died childless;

30. and the third took her;

31. and in like manner all the seven.

32. And they died and left no children. Last of all the woman also died.

33. Therefore at the resurrection whose wife is she? for all the seven had her to wife.

34. And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry and are given in marriage.

35. But they who are counted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:

36. for they can die no more, being like the angels: and they are the children of God as being the children of the resurrection.

37. Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush; for he calleth the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

38. And He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for to Him they are all living.

39. And some of the scribes replied, Master, thou hast indeed said right.

40. And they dared not any more to ask Him any such question.

41. And He said unto them, How do they say, that Christ is the son of David?

42. when David himself saith in the book of Psalms, "The Lord said unto my Lord,

43. Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool."

44. David therefore calleth Him Lord, and how is He then his son?

45. And He said to his disciples, in the audience of all the people,

46. Beware of the scribes, who affect to walk in long robes, and love salutations in public places, and the chief seats in the Synagogues, and uppermost places at feasts;

47. who devour widows houses, and for a shew of religion make long prayers: these shall receive a heavier sentence. 

## Luke 21

1. And He looked up and saw the rich people bringing their gifts to the treasury:

2. and He saw also a poor widow throwing in two mites.

3. And He said, Verily I tell you, this poor widow hath put in more than they all.

4. For all these have out of their abundance contributed to the offerings of God: but she out of her penury hath given all she had.

5. And as some were speaking of the temple; how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts, He said, As for these things which ye see,

6. the days will come, in which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be demolished.

7. And they asked Him, saying, Master, when shall these things be? And what will be the sign when these things shall come to pass?

8. And He said, Take heed that ye be not deceived; for many shall come in my name, saying, I am the Christ; and the time is near: but do not therefore go after them.

9. And when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these must first happen; but the end will not be directly.

10. Then said He unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;

11. and there will be great earthquakes in several places, and famines, and pestilences, and fearful sights and great prodigies from heaven.

12. But before all these things they will lay hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues, and prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake:

13. but it shall be for a testimony to you.

14. Fix it therefore in your hearts not to premeditate a defence: for I will give you a mouth and wisdom,

15. which all your adversaries shall not be able to contradict nor withstand.

16. But ye shall be betrayed even by parents, and brethren, and kindred and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death:

17. and ye will be hated by all men for my sake.

18. But not an hair of your head shall perish.

19. In your patience therefore possess your souls.

20. And when ye shall see Jerusalem surrounded with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh: then let them that are in Judea flee to the mountains,

21. and those that are in the midst of it, depart; and let not them that are in the countries enter into it.

22. For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.

23. But wo to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days; for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people,

24. and they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and be led captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trampled down by the Gentiles, till the times of the Gentiles too shall be fulfilled.

25. And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity, the sea and the waves roring:

26. and men ready to die for fear and apprehension of the things that are coming upon the land; for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.

27. And then shall they see the Son of man coming, as on a cloud, with power and great glory.

28. But when these things begin to come to pass, look upwards and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh.

29. And He spake a parable to them, Behold the fig-tree,

30. and all the trees, when they shoot out, ye see and know of yourselves that summer is now near:

31. so likewise know ye, when ye see these things coming to pass, that the kingdom of God is at hand.

32. Verily I tell you, this generation shall not pass away till all be accomplished.

33. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.

34. Take heed to yourselves, least at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and the cares of life, and so that day should come upon you unawares:

35. for as a snare shall it come upon all that dwell on the face of the whole earth.

36. Watch therefore and be constant in prayer, that ye may be counted worthy to escape all these things, which shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.

37. Thus He was by day teaching in the temple; and at night He retired to the mount called the mount of Olives.

38. And all the people came early in the morning to Him in the temple to hear Him. 

## Luke 22

1. Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the passover.

2. And the chief priests and scribes were consulting how they might put Him to death; for they were afraid of the people.

3. Then entred Satan into Judas who was surnamed Iscariot, one of the twelve.

4. And he went and conferred with the chief priests and the captains, how he might betray Him unto them.

5. And they were glad and agreed to give him money:

6. and he accepted the terms, and sought an opportunity to betray Him unto them in the absence of the multitude.

7. The day of unleavened bread being come, on which the paschal-lamb was to be slain,

8. Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare the passover for us, that we may eat of it.

9. And they said unto Him, Where wouldst thou have us prepare it?

10. And He said unto them, Behold, when ye are come into the city, there shall meet you a man, carrying a pitcher of water, follow him into the house where he entreth:

11. and say to the master of the house, Our Master inquireth by us, Where is the room, in which I may eat the passover with my disciples?

12. And he will shew you a large upper room set out; there make it ready.

13. And they went and found as He had told them; and prepared the passover.

14. And when the hour was come, He sat down and the twelve apostles with Him.

15. And He said unto them, I have earnestly desired to eat of this passover with you before I suffer:

16. for I say unto you, that I will not eat of it any more, till it be accomplished in the kingdom of God.

17. And taking the cup He gave thanks and said, Take this and distribute it among yourselves.

18. For I tell you, that I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine, till the kingdom of God shall come.

19. And He took bread, and gave thanks and brake it, and gave it to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of me:

20. as also the cup after supper, saying, This cup represents the new covenant in my blood, which is shed for you.

21. And yet behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is at table with me:

22. and the Son of man is going indeed as was determined; but wo to that man by whom He is betrayed.

23. And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do it.

24. And there was also a dispute among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest:

25. but He said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in authority are called benefactors.

26. But ye shall not do so: but let the greatest among you be as the younger; and he that presides as he that serveth.

27. For which is greater, he that sitteth at table, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at table? but I am among you as one that serveth.

28. Ye have continued with me in my temptations;

29. and I appoint you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me:

30. that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

31. And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you my disciples, that he may sift you as wheat:

32. but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith may not fail; and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.

33. And he said unto Him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee both to prison and to death.

34. But He replied, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before thou hast thrice denied that thou knowest me.

35. And He said unto them, When I sent you forth without purse, or bag, or shoes, did ye want any thing? and they said, Nothing.

36. Then said He unto them, But now let him, that hath a purse, take it, and his bag likewise; and let him that has no sword, sell his garment and buy one:

37. for I tell you, that this which is written must yet be accomplished in me, "And He was numbered with transgressors," for the things foretold concerning me are near at an end.

38. And they said, Lord, behold here are two swords. And He said unto them, It is enough.

39. And He came out and went, as He used to do, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed Him.

40. And when He was at the place, He said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.

41. And when He was withdrawn from them about a stone's-cast, He kneeled down and prayed saying,

42. Father, if thou art willing take away this cup from me---nevertheless, not my will but thine be done.

43. And there appeared to Him an angel from heaven strengthening Him.

44. And being in agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was like clotted blood falling down upon the ground.

45. And when He rose up from prayer, He came to his disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow;

46. and He said to them, Why do ye sleep? rise and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.

47. And while He was yet speaking, behold a multitude; and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve apostles, came before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss Him:

48. and Jesus said to him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?

49. But when they that were about Him saw what would follow, they said to Him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?

50. And one of them smote the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear:

51. but Jesus said, Suffer ye thus far; and He touched his ear and healed him.

52. Then said Jesus to the chief priests, and officers of the temple, and elders, that were come to Him, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and clubs?

53. When I was day after day with you in the temple, ye did not stretch out your hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.

54. Then they took Him and led Him away, and brought Him to the high priest's. And Peter followed at a distance.

55. And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and sat down together, Peter also sat down among them:

56. and a servant-maid seeing him as he sat by the fire, and looking hard at him, said, This fellow was also with Him:

57. But he denied Him, saying, Woman, I do not know Him.

58. And after a little while another person seeing him said, And thou art one of them: but Peter said, Man, I am not.

59. And about an hour after, another confidently affirmed saying, In truth this fellow also was with Him; for he is a Galilean too: but Peter answered,

60. Man, I know not what thou sayst. And immediately, while he was yet speaking, the cock crew.

61. And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter; and Peter called to mind the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, Before the cock crow thou wilt deny me thrice.

62. And Peter went out and wept bitterly.

63. And the men that laid hold on Jesus, insulted and abused Him;

64. and when they had blind-folded Him, they struck Him on the face, and asked Him, saying, Prophesy who it was that smote thee.

65. And many other things spake they against Him, blaspheming Him.

66. And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people, and chief-priests, and scribes, assembled together, and ordered Him up into their council:

67. and said to Him, Art thou the Messiah? tell us. And He said unto them, If I should tell you, ye would not believe:

68. and if I should put any question to you, ye would not answer me, nor discharge me.

69. But hereafter shall the Son of man be seated on the right hand of the power of God.

70. And they all said, Art thou then the Son of God?

71. And He said unto them, I am. And they said, What need have we of any farther evidence? when we ourselves have it from his own mouth? 

## Luke 23

1. Then they all rose up and led Him to Pilate.

2. And they began to accuse Him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbiding to give tribute to Cesar; saying, that He himself is Christ the king.

3. And Pilate asked Him, saying, Art thou the king of the Jews? And He answered him and said, I am as thou sayest.

4. But Pilate said to the chief priests, and to the people, I find nothing criminal in this man.

5. Then they were more vehement, saying, He stirreth up the people to sedition, spreading his doctrine throughout all Judea: having begun at Galilee and come even to this place.

6. Now when Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked, if the man were a Galilean:

7. and understanding that He was of Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also at Jerusalem at that time.

8. And Herod, when he saw Jesus, was very glad; for he had of a long time been desirous to see Him, because he had heard much of Him, and he hoped to see some miracle wrought by Him.

9. And he asked Him many questions; but He answered him nothing:

10. though the chief priests and scribes stood vehemently accusing Him.

11. But Herod with his soldiers set Him at nought and insulted Him, and put on Him a gaudy robe, and sent Him back to Pilate.

12. And on that same day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other: for before they were at enmity one with the other.

13. And Pilate called together the chief priests, and the rulers,

14. and the people, and said unto them, Ye have brought to me this man as one that perverteth the people: and behold I have examined Him before you, and found nothing chargeable on Him, of the things you alledge against Him:

15. nor Herod neither; for I sent you to him, and behold nothing worthy of death is proved upon Him.

16. I will therefore chastise Him, and so release Him.

17. Now he was obliged to release one to them at the feast.

18. And they all cried out, saying, Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas:

19. (who for a riot in the city, and for murder, was committed to prison:)

20. Pilate therefore spake to them again, being desirous to release Jesus.

21. But they bawled out, saying, Crucify Him, crucify Him.

22. And he said to them a third time, what evil hath He done? I have found nothing in Him deserving death: I will therefore chastise Him, and let Him go.

23. But they insisted upon it with loud clamours, demanding Him to be crucified: and their voices and those of the chief priests prevailed.

24. So Pilate gave sentence that what they demanded should be done.

25. And he released to them him that for sedition and murder had been cast into prison, whom they desired; and delivered up Jesus to their will.

26. And when they led Him away, they laid hold on one Simon a Cyrenean coming out of the country, and put the cross on him to bear it behind Jesus.

27. And there followed Him a great multitude of people, and of women, who also bewailed and lamented Him: but Jesus turning to them said,

28. Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.

29. For behold the days are coming in which they shall say, happy are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never gave suck.

30. Then shall they say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us:

31. for if they do these things to the green wood, what shall be done to the dry?

32. And there were also two other malefactors led with Him to be put to death.

33. And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, there they crucified Him and the malefactors: one on his right hand and the other on his left.

34. And Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his garments, and cast lots for them.

35. And the people stood looking on, and even the rulers also with them derided Him, saying, He saved others, let Him save Himself, if He be the Christ the chosen of God.

36. And the soldiers too insulted Him, coming to Him and offering Him vinegar, saying,

37. If thou art the king of the Jews, save thyself.

38. And there was a superscription written over Him in Greek, and Latin and Hebrew letters, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

39. And one of the malefactors that were executed with Him reviled Him, saying, If thou be the Messiah, save thyself and us.

40. But the other answered and rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God neither, when thou thyself art in the same condemnation?

41. And we indeed justly; for we receive the due rewards of our deeds, but this man hath done nothing amiss.

42. And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.

43. And Jesus answered him, I assure thee, thou shalt be with me this day in paradise.

44. Now it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land till the ninth hour.

45. And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.

46. And Jesus cried with a loud voice and said, Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit. And when He had said thus, He expired.

47. And when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this man was righteous.

48. And all the multitudes that came together to this affecting sight, seeing what happened, smote on their breasts and returned.

49. And all his acquaintance stood at a distance, and the women that followed Him from Galilee, beholding these things.

50. And behold there was a man of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, named Joseph, a counsellor, a good man and a just:

51. (who had not consented to their counsel nor their action; and who was also himself in expectation of the kingdom of God:)

52. he came to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus:

53. and he took it down and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre hewn in stone, where no one had ever yet been laid.

54. Now that day was the preparation, and the sabbath was coming on:

55. wherefore the women, that came with Him from Galilee, followed Joseph, and saw the sepulchre, and how the body was laid:

56. but returned and prepared spices and perfumes; and then rested on the sabbath-day, according to the commandment. 

## Luke 24

1. And on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared; (and some others with them:) and found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre:

2. so they went in,

3. but found not the body of the Lord Jesus.

4. And while they were in perplexity about it, behold, two men stood by them in shining robes.

5. And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the ground, the men said unto them, Why do ye seek the living among the dead?

6. He is not here, He is risen: remember how He spake to you, when He was yet in Galilee,

7. saying, the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of wicked men, and be crucified; and the third day rise again.

8. And they remembered his words,

9. and returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things to the eleven apostles, and to all the rest.

10. Now it was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them, that told these things to the apostles:

11. and their words appeared to them as an idle tale, and they did not believe them.

12. But Peter arose and ran to the sepulchre; and stooping down he saw the linen cloths lying by themselves: and he went away, wondering in himself at what had happened.

13. And behold two of them were going that day to a village about threescore furlongs from Jerusalem, called Emmaus.

14. And they were conversing together about all these things which had happened.

15. And while they were discoursing and reasoning together, Jesus himself drew near and went along with them.

16. But their eyes were so restrained that they did not know Him.

17. And He said unto them, What subjects are these, which ye are discoursing of to one another as ye walk, and why are ye sorrowful?

18. And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered and said to Him, Art thou only a sojourner at Jerusalem, and hast not heard of the things which have been done there within these few days?

19. And He said unto them, What things? And they replied, Those concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet powerful both in work and word before God and all the people:

20. how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and crucified Him.

21. But we hoped that it was He that would have delivered Israel: and besides all this, to-day is the third day since these things were done.

22. And indeed some women of our company much surprised us: who having been early at the sepulchre,

23. and not finding his body there, came and said likewise that they had seen a vision of angels, who said He was alive.

24. And some of those that were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it so as the women had said: but Him they did not see.

25. And He said unto them, O people void of understanding and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken.

26. Was not the Messiah to suffer these things, and so to enter into his glory?

27. And beginning from Moses, and all the prophets, He explained to them in all the scriptures the things that were spoken concerning Himself.

28. And they drew nigh to the village whither they were going: and He made as if He was going farther.

29. And they pressed Him, saying, Stay with us, for it is towards evening, and the day is far spent. And He went in to tarry with them.

30. And as He sat at table with them, He took bread and blessed it, and then brake it and gave to them.

31. And their eyes were opened, and they knew Him.

32. And He disappeared from them. And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, as He was talking with us by the way, and while He was opening to us the scriptures?

33. And they rose up immediately and returned to Jerusalem; and sound the eleven and others with them assembled together, saying,

34. The Lord is risen indeed, and hath been seen by Simon.

35. Then these also related what had happened by the way, and how He became known to them in breaking of bread.

36. And as they were thus speaking, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be to you.

37. But they being terrified and frighted, thought they saw a spirit.

38. And He said to them, Why are ye troubled? and why do such thoughts rise in your hearts?

39. Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.

40. And when He said this, He shewed them his hands and feet.

41. But they not yet believing for joy, and being amazed, He said to them, Have ye here any thing to eat?

42. And they gave Him part of a broiled fish and some honey-comb:

43. and He took, and did eat before them.

44. And He said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all the things must be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and Psalms, concerning me.

45. Then He opened their mind, to understand the scriptures:

46. and said unto them, thus it is written, and thus it was necessary that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead on the third day;

47. and that in his name should be preached repentance and remission of sins to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

48. And ye are witnesses of these things: and I will send upon you the promise of my Father;

49. but do ye continue in the city of Jerusalem, till ye are endued with power from on high.

50. And He led them out as far as to Bethany: and lifted up his hands and blessed them.

51. And while He was blessing them, He was parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.

52. And they worshipped Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.

53. And they were constantly in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
