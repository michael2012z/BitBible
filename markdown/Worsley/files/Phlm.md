# Philemon

## Philemon 1

1. Paul a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy a brother, to Philemon our beloved brother and fellow-laborer, and to the beloved Apphia,

2. and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thine house,

3. grace and peace be to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

4. I thank my God always making mention of thee in my prayers,

5. (hearing of the faith which thou hast towards the Lord Jesus, and of thy love to all the saints,)

6. that the communication of thy faith may become effectual in the acknowledgement of all the good that is in you towards Christ Jesus:

7. for we have much joy and comfort in thy love, because by thee, dear brother, the bowels of the saints are refreshed.

8. Wherefore though I have sufficient authority in Christ to enjoin thee what is meet,

9. I would rather intreat thee out of love to me, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner too for the sake of Jesus Christ.

10. I intreat thee then for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds,

11. who was formerly unprofitable to thee, but now profitable both to thee and to me; whom I have sent back to thee:

12. him therefore, as my own bowels, do thou receive.

13. Whom I would gladly have kept with me, that he might have ministered unto me as thou wouldst have done, in the bonds of the gospel.

14. But I would do nothing without thy knowledge, that thy kindness might not be as it were forced, but voluntary.

15. For perhaps he was therefore parted from thee for a season, that thou mightest receive him for ever:

16. not now as a servant, but above a servant, a dear brother, especially to me, and how much more to thee both in the flesh and in the Lord.

17. If therefore thou accountest me a friend, receive him as thou wouldst receive me.

18. If he hath wronged thee in any thing, or is indebted to thee, place it to my accompt:

19. I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will pay it: not to say that thou indeed owest even thy own self to me.

20. Yea, my brother, let me enjoy this satisfaction from thee in the Lord: and thus refresh my bowels in the Lord.

21. Being fully persuaded of thy compliance, I have written to thee; knowing that thou wilt indeed do more than I ask.

22. But I must add, prepare me also a lodging; for I hope that through your prayers I shall be restored to you.

23. Epaphras my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, and Marcus,

24. Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke my fellow-laborers, salute thee.

25. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
