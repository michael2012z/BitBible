# Galatians

## Galatians 1

1. Paul an apostle (not from men, nor by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead),

2. and all the brethren that are with me, to the churches of Galatia:

3. grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,

4. who gave himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from the present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father:

5. to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

6. I wonder that ye are so soon removed from him who called you by the grace of Christ to another gospel: which is not another;

7. but there be some that disturb you, and would subvert the gospel of Christ.

8. But tho' we or an angel from heaven should preach to you any other gospel than what we have preached to you; let him be accursed.

9. I say it again, if any one preach to you any other gospel than what ye have received, let him be accursed.

10. For do I now persuade you to obey men or God? Or do I seek to please men? if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.

11. But I assure you, brethren, that the gospel preached by me is not of human invention.

12. For I neither received it, nor was taught it by man, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

13. For ye have heard of my conversation formerly in Judaism, that I outragiously persecuted the church of God, and laid it waste:

14. and I made a proficiency in Judaism above many of the same age with me in my own nation, being excessively zealous for the traditions of my fathers.

15. But when it pleased God, (who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,)

16. to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach Him among the gentiles; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood,

17. nor went I up to Jerusalem to those that were apostles before me, but I departed into Arabia, and afterwards returned again to Damascus.

18. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and I staid with him fifteen days.

19. But I saw no other of the apostles, except James the brother of our Lord.

20. (Now in what I write to you, behold, before God, I do not lie.)

21. Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia,

22. and was not known in person to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ.

23. But only they had heard that he who persecuted us before, now preacheth the faith which he formerly would have destroyed.

24. And they glorified God on my account. 

## Galatians 2

1. Fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus also with me.

2. But I went up according to a divine revelation, and laid before them the gospel which I preach among the gentiles: though privately to those of note, least I should run, or had run in vain.

3. But even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was not compelled to be circumcised;

4. and that because of the false brethren clandestinely introduced, who had crept in as spies upon our liberty, which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:

5. to whom we yielded no submission, not even for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.

6. And as to those who seemed to be men of note, whatever they were, it is all one to me, (God accepteth no man's person) for even these eminent persons added nothing more to me.

7. But on the contrary, seeing that I was intrusted with the gospel of uncircumcision, as Peter was with that of the circumcision;

8. (for He who wrought effectually in Peter as to the apostleship of the circumcision, wrought effectually also in me as to the gentiles:)

9. and knowing the grace which was given to me; James, and Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars of the church, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the gentiles, and they to the circumcision.

10. Only desiring that we would remember the poor: which I also was forward to do.

11. But when Peter came to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was indeed to be blamed.

12. For before certain men came from James, he did eat with the gentiles; but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision.

13. And the rest of the Jews dissembled also with him; so that Barnabas too was carried away with their dissimulation.

14. But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all,---If thou, who art a Jew, livest sometimes after the manner of the gentiles, and not like the Jews, why dost thou now in a manner compel the gentiles to judaize?

15. We, who are Jews by birth, and not sinners of the gentiles,

16. knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.

17. But if while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ therefore the minister of sin?

18. God forbid. And if I build again the same things which I demolished, I shew myself a transgressor: for I through the law am dead to the law,

19. that I might live unto God.

20. I am crucified with Christ; yet I live, though no longer I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave up himself for me.

21. I do not frustate the grace of God: for if righteousness be by the law, then Christ died in vain. 

## Galatians 3

1. O senseless Galatians, who hath so bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth? you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth as crucified.

2. This only would I learn of you, Did ye receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

3. Are ye so void of understanding? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?

4. have ye suffered so many things in vain? if indeed in vain.

5. He therefore that imparteth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doth he it by the works of the law, or by the doctrine of faith?

6. As Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness:

7. so ye know that they who believe, are the children of Abraham.

8. And the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the gentiles through faith, preached the gospel to Abraham long ago, saying, "In thee shall all nations be blessed."

9. So then they that believe, are blessed with believing Abraham.

10. For as many as are of the works of the law, are under the curse; for it is written, Cursed be every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.

11. And that by the law no one is justified before God is evident; for it is written "The just shall live by faith:"

12. now the law is not of faith, but saith, "The man that doth them, shall live in them."

13. Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, having been made a curse for us: for it is written, "Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:"

14. that the blessing of Abraham might come on the gentiles by Christ Jesus; that we through faith might receive the promise of the Spirit.

15. Brethren, (I speak after the manner of men,) no one cancelleth or addeth to a covenant which hath been ratified, though it be but the covenant of a man.

16. Now the promises were made to Abraham, and to his seed. He doth not say, "and to seeds," as of many; but as of one, "and to thy seed," which is Christ.

17. This then I say, that the law, which was given four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul the covenant, which was so long before confirmed by God unto Christ, to make void the promise.

18. For if the inheritance be from the law, it is no more from the promise: whereas God gave it to Abraham by promise.

19. What then availeth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come, to whom the promise was made; and it was delivered by angels in the hand of a mediator.

20. Now a mediator is not the mediator of one only; and God is but one.

21. Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? not at all: for if a law had been given, which could have confered life, certainly righteousness would have been by the law.

22. But the scripture hath shut up all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.

23. But before faith came, we were kept shut up under the law, till the faith appeared which was to be revealed.

24. So that the law was our guide to lead us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

25. But now faith is come we are no longer under a pedagogue.

26. For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.

27. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ:

28. and there is neither Jew nor Greek, those is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.

29. And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise. 

## Galatians 4

1. Now as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he is to be lord of all:

2. but is under guardians and managers till the time appointed by the father.

3. So we when we were children, were in servitude under the elements of the world:

4. but when the fulness of the time came, God sent forth his Son born of a woman made under the law,

5. that He might redeem those that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.

6. And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

7. So that thou art no longer a servant, but a son; and if a son, an heir also of God through Christ.

8. But then indeed, when ye knew not God, ye served those which in reality are no gods.

9. But now that ye know God, or rather are known by God, how is it that ye turn again to the poor weak elements, to which ye desire again to be in bondage as before?

10. Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years:

11. so that I am afraid for you, least I have indeed bestowed upon you labour in vain.

12. Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I also was as ye are: and ye have not injured me at all.

13. But ye know that in the infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel to you at first:

14. and my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected me for it; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.

15. What then was your blessedness? for I bear you witness that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.

16. And am I become your enemy for telling you the truth?

17. They are zealous for you, but not as they ought: for they would exclude us, that ye may be zealous for them:

18. But it is good to be zealously affected always in that which is good, and not only when I am present with you.

19. My little children, of whom I do as it were travail in birth again,

20. till Christ be formed in you, I should be glad to be present with you even now, and to change my voice; for I am in doubt about you.

21. Tell me, you that are so desirous to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?

22. where it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by a servant, and one by a free-woman?

23. But he who was of the servant, was born according to the course of nature; whereas the son of the free-woman was by virtue of the promise.

24. Which things are figurative; for these persons are emblems of the two covenants, the one from mount Sinai, bringing forth children unto bondage, which is Hagar: for this name Hagar,

25. a rock, is expressive of mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to the present Jerusalem, which is in bondage with her children.

26. But the Jerusalem above is represented by the free-woman, which is the mother of us all.

27. For it is written, Rejoice thou barren, that for a while didst not bear, break forth and cry aloud for joy, thou that didst not travail with child; for many more are the children of the desolate than of her that hath an husband."

28. Now we, brethren, like Isaac, are children of the promise.

29. But as then he that was born after the flesh, persecuted him who was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.

30. But what saith the scripture? "Cast out the servant and her son: for the son of the servant shall not inherit with the son of the free-woman."

31. Now we, my brethren, are not children of the servant, but of the free-woman. 

## Galatians 5

1. Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again in the yoke of bondage.

2. Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.

3. And I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to the whole law.

4. Christ is become nothing to you, whosoever of you are seeking to be justified by the law: ye are fallen from the grace of the gospel.

5. For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.

6. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love.

7. Ye did run well: who hindered you from obeying the truth?

8. This persuasion came not from him that called you: but a little leaven leaveneth the whole mass.

9. I have confidence in you however through the Lord,

10. that ye will not think otherwise: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgement, whosoever he be.

11. And I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted by the Jews? for then the offence of the cross is ceased.

12. I wish they were even cut off from your communion, that make such disturbance amongst you.

13. For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only abuse not this liberty for an occasion to indulge the flesh, but by mutual love serve one another.

14. For all the law is fulfilled in one precept, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

15. But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not destroyed by one another.

16. I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye will not fulfil the desire of the flesh:

17. for the flesh desireth things contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit things contrary to the flesh: and these are opposite to each other; so that ye do not those things which ye would.

18. But if ye be led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.

19. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, such as, adultery, fornication, uncleanness,

20. lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, enmities, strifes, emulations, animosities, contentions, divisions,

21. heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and the like: of which I forewarn you, as I have also told you before, that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.

22. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering,

23. gentleness, goodness, fidelity, meekness, temperance: against such things there is no law.

24. And they, that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh with it's passions and desires.

25. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

26. Let us not be vain-glorious, provoking one another, envying one another. 

## Galatians 6

1. Brethren, if a man be overtaken in any fault, do ye, who are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, least thou also shouldst be tempted.

2. Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.

3. For if any one thinketh that he is something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.

4. But let every one try his own work, and then he will have matter of glorying in himself alone, and not in another.

5. For every one shall bear his own burthen.

6. And let him, that is instructed in the word, communicate in all good things to him that instructeth.

7. Be not deceived, God is not to be mocked: for whatever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.

8. He then, who soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he, that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.

9. And let us not be weary in doing good: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.

10. And therefore as we have opportunity, let us do good to all men, but especially to those who are of the houshold of faith.

11. Ye see in how large letters I have written to you with my own hand.

12. They, who want to make a fair appearance in the flesh, would constrain you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.

13. For they, who are circumcised, do not themselves keep the law: but they would have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.

14. But God forbid that I should glory, unless in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.

15. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but being created anew.

16. And as many as shall walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be on them, even upon all the Israel of God.

17. For the future, let no one give me uneasiness: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.

18. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, my brethren. Amen.
