# 1 Timothy

## 1 Timothy 1

1. Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the appointment of God our Saviour, and the Lord Jesus Christ our hope,

2. to Timothy my true son in the faith, be grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord.

3. As I exhorted thee to stay at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge certain persons not to teach other doctrine,

4. nor attend to fables and endless genealogies, which occasion debates, rather than pious edification in the faith:

5. so do, and acquaint them that the end of that charge is charity, out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned:

6. from which some having swerved are turned aside to vain discourses;

7. desiring to be teachers of the law, though they neither understand what they say, nor what things they assert.

8. But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;

9. knowing this, that a law does not lie against a righteous person, but against the lawless and unruly, the impious and wicked, the unholy and profane,

10. parricides, murderers, whoremongers, sodomites, kidnappers, liars, false-swearers, and if there be any thing else contrary to that sound doctrine,

11. which is according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I was intrusted.

12. And I give thanks to Christ Jesus our Lord, who gave me ability for the work, that He accounted me faithful, having put me into the ministry,

13. who before was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and an oppressor. But I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief: and the grace of our Lord superabounded,

14. with faith and love in Christ Jesus.

15. It is a truth highly to be believed, and worthy to be received by all, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners:---of whom I am one of the chief.

16. But for this end I obtained mercy, that in me a chief sinner Jesus Christ might display his long-suffering, for an example to those who should afterwards believe on Him to eternal life.

17. Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

18. This charge I commit to thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which before came on thee, that by them thou mightest war a good warfare,

19. having faith and a good conscience, which some putting away have made shipwreck concerning the faith:

20. of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme. 

## 1 Timothy 2

1. This then I exhort thee first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings he made for all men;

2. particularly for kings, and all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all piety and virtue.

3. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour:

4. who is willing that all men should be saved, and therefore come to the knowledge of the truth.

5. For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus:

6. who gave himself a ransom for all, a testimony to be published in due time,

7. for which I was appointed a herald and an apostle. I speak the truth in Christ, I lie not; I am a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.

8. I direct therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands without wrath and debate:

9. likewise that women dress themselves in decent apparel with modesty and prudence, not in braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly garments;

10. but in good works, as becometh women professing godliness.

11. Let the woman learn in silence with all submission: but I permit not a woman to teach,

12. nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be silent.

13. For Adam was formed first, then Eve.

14. And Adam was not seduced by the serpent, but the woman being led astray was first in the transgression.

15. Yet shall she be saved through childbirth, if they continue in faith and love, in holiness and modesty. 

## 1 Timothy 3

1. It is certain, if any one is desirous of the episcopal office, he desireth a good work.

2. A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of but one wife, sober, prudent, grave,

3. hospitable, able to teach, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of sordid gain, moderate, not quarrelsome,

4. not covetous, governing his own family well, having his children in subjection with all gravity;

5. (for if any one know not how to govern his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)

6. not one newly converted, least being puffed up he fall into the condemnation of the devil.

7. He ought also to have an honorable testimony from those that are without, least he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.

8. The deacons should likewise be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of base gain,

9. holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.

10. (And let these also first be proved, then let them take the office of deacons, if they be found blameless.)

11. And their wives likewise grave, not slanderers, sober, and faithful in all things.

12. Let the deacons too be husbands of one wife only, governing their children and their own houses well.

13. For they, that discharge the office of a deacon well, gain to themselves a good degree of honor, and much freedom in promoting the faith that is in Christ Jesus.

14. These things I write unto thee, hoping to come to thee shortly.

15. But if I should be retarded, that thou mayst know how thou oughtest to behave in the house of God, the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.

16. And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the Gentiles, believed on in the world, and received up into glory. 

## 1 Timothy 4

1. Now the Spirit expressly saith, that in latter times some shall apostatize from the faith, attending to seducing spirits,

2. and doctrines of demons founded in the hypocrisy of liars, who are seared in their own conscience, forbidding to marry,

3. and enjoining abstinence from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving by those that believe and know the truth.

4. For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving:

5. for it is sanctified by the word of God and by prayer.

6. If thou lay these things before the brethren, thou wilt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, as one brought up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, to which thou hast attained.

7. But profane and groundless fables reject, and exercise thyself unto godliness.

8. For bodily exercise profiteth little, but piety is profitable unto all things, having the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come:

9. this is a certain truth and worthy of all acceptance.

10. For to this end we both labour and suffer reproach, because we have hope in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithful.

11. These things declare and teach.

12. Let no one have cause to despise thy youth; but he thou an example to believers in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.

13. Till I come attend to reading, to exhortation, and teaching.

14. Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.

15. Meditate on these things, be wholly in them, that thy proficiency may be manifest in all.

16. Take heed to thyself, and to thy doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this, thou wilt both save thyself and those that hear thee. 

## 1 Timothy 5

1. Do not chide a senior, but exhort him as a father; and younger men as brethren:

2. the elder women as mothers, the younger as sisters, with all purity.

3. Honour widows who are widows indeed.

4. But if any widow have children or grandchildren, let these learn first to shew piety at home, and to make suitable returns to their parents: for this is becoming, and acceptable in the sight of God.

5. Now she, that is really a widow and desolate, hopeth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.

6. But she that indulgeth to luxury, is dead while she liveth.

7. These things give in charge, that they may be blameless.

8. But if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own family, he hath renounced the faith, and is worse than an infidel.

9. Let not a widow be chosen into the number under sixty years old,

10. having been the wife of one man: in repute for good actions, if she have educated children, if she have entertained strangers, if she have washed the feet of saints, if she have relieved the afflicted, and diligently followed every good work.

11. But the younger widows refuse: for when they grow wanton against Christ, they will needs marry:

12. and are therefore to be condemned, because they violate their first faith.

13. And withal being idle they learn to go about from house to house: and are not only idle, but tatlers also and busy-bodies, talking of things unbecoming them.

14. I would therefore have the younger widows marry, bear children, manage houshold affairs, and give no occasion to the adversary for reproach.

15. For some are already turned aside after Satan.

16. And if any believer have relations widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be burdened; that it may relieve those that are indeed widows and desolate.

17. Let the elders, who preside well, be counted worthy of double honor, especially those that labour in preaching and teaching.

18. For the scripture saith, "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn:" and, "The workman is worthy of his hire."

19. Receive not an accusation against an elder, unless from two or three witnesses.

20. Those that offend reprove before all, that others also may fear.

21. I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou keep to these things without preference of persons, doing nothing with partiality.

22. Lay hands on no man precipitately, and be not hereby a partaker in the sins of others. Keep thyself pure.

23. Drink no longer water only, but use a little wine with it, for the sake of thy stomach and thy frequent infirmities.

24. The sins of some men are notorious, leading as it were to their condemnation; and some more artful they follow after.

25. So also the good works of some are manifest; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid. 

## 1 Timothy 6

1. Let as many as are servants under the yoke account their own masters worthy of all honor; that the name of God and his doctrine may not be blasphemed:

2. and let not those who have believing masters, despise them, because they are brethren; but serve them more readily, because they are faithful and beloved by God, partakers of his grace.

3. These things teach and exhort. If any one teach otherwise, and adhere not to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the doctrine which is according to godliness;

4. he is proud, knowing nothing, but is delirious about questions and strifes of words: from which cometh envy, contention, calumnies, wicked suspicions, perverse debates of men corrupted in mind,

5. and void of truth, accounting gain to be godliness: from such withdraw thyself.

6. But godliness with contentment is great gain.

7. For we brought nothing into the world, and it is certain that we can carry nothing out:

8. having therefore food and raiment, let us be herewith content.

9. But they, that will be rich, fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which plunge men into ruin and perdition.

10. For the love of money is the root of all evils, which some coveting after have been led astray from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

11. But do thou, O man of God, flee these things, and follow after righteousness, piety, fidelity, love, patience, meekness.

12. Maintain the glorious combat of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which thou hast been called, and hast made a good profession before many witnesses.

13. I charge thee before God, who giveth life to all, and before Christ Jesus who witnessed a good confession before Pontius Pilate,

14. that thou keep this commandment, unspotted and blameless, till the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ;

15. which He will manifest in his own times, who is the blessed and only potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords,

16. who alone hath immortality, dwelling in light inaccessible, whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.

17. Charge them, that are rich in this world, not to be high-minded nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who richly affords us all things for enjoyment: charge them to do good,

18. to be rich in good works, to be ready to distribute, willing to communicate;

19. treasuring up to themselves a good foundation for the future, that they may obtain eternal life.

20. O Timothy, keep that with which thou art entrusted, avoiding profane empty babblings, and the oppositions of science falsely so called:

21. which some pretending to, have erred from the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.
