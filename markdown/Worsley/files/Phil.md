# Philippians

## Philippians 1

1. Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus, which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:

2. grace be unto you, and peace from God our father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

3. I give thanks unto my God upon every mention of you,

4. (always making supplication for you all with joy

5. in every prayer of mine) for your attachment to the gospel, from the first day even till now;

6. being confident of this, that He who hath begun a good work in you will continue to perfect it till the day of Jesus Christ.

7. As it is just for me to think this of you all, because ye have me in your heart, both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, being all of you partakers of the same grace with me.

8. For God is my witness, how much I long for you all, as with the bowels of Jesus Christ.

9. And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all discernment;

10. that ye may try things that differ, that ye may be sincere and without offence until the day of Christ;

11. being full of the fruits of righteousness which are through Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God.

12. But I would have you know, my brethren, that the things, which have befallen me, have proved rather to the advancement of the gospel:

13. so that my bonds are manifest in all the palace, and all other places, to be for the sake of Christ;

14. and many of the brethren in the Lord, encouraged by my bonds, are much more bold to publish the word without fear.

15. Some indeed through envy and strife, and some also through good-will:

16. the former preach Christ out of contention, not sincerely, thinking to add affliction to my bonds;

17. the others out of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.

18. What then? yet every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is preached: and in this I rejoice, yea and I will rejoice;

19. for I know that this shall turn to my safety through your prayer, and the aid of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.

20. According to my earnest expectation and hope, that I shall be put to shame in nothing; but that with all freedom of speech, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.

21. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain: and if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor:

22. so that I know not what to chuse;

23. for I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ, which is much preferable:

24. but to abide in the flesh is more necessary for you.

25. And as I am confident of this, I know that I shall abide and shall continue with you all, for your improvement and the joy of your faith:

26. that your rejoicing in Christ Jesus may abound through me, by my coming to you again.

27. Only behave worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether I come and see you, or be absent, I may hear of you, that ye stand firm in one Spirit, striving together as with one soul for the saith of the gospel;

28. and are in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is a demonstration of ruin to them, but to you of salvation, and this from God.

29. For to you it is granted as a favor from Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for his sake:

30. having the same conflict as ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me. 

## Philippians 2

1. If therefore there be any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any participation of the Spirit,

2. if any bowels of compassion, compleat ye my joy, be like-minded, maintaining the same love, with your souls united, in attending to the one thing needful.

3. Do nothing through strife or vain-glory, but in lowliness of mind each esteeming others better than themselves.

4. Look not every one to his own interests only, but every one also to the concerns of others.

5. Let the same mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:

6. who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be as God.

7. Yet He emptied himself, assuming the form of a servant, when made in the likeness of men:

8. and being in the human state, He humbled himself, and was obedient even unto death, and that the death of the cross.

9. Wherefore God hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a name above every name:

10. that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of celestial beings, as well as of those on earth, and of those under the earth;

11. and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

12. Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed the gospel, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence; be still working out your own salvation though with fear and trembling:

13. for it is God that worketh in you both to will, and to work, out of his own good-pleasure.

14. Do all things without murmurings and disputings:

15. that ye may be blameless and inoffensive, the children of God without reproof, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation; among whom ye shine as lights in the world,

16. exhibiting the word of life; to my rejoicing in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.

17. But if I be even poured forth as a libation on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and congratulate with you all.

18. And for the same cause do ye also rejoice, and congratulate with me.

19. But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be refreshed, by knowing the state of your affairs.

20. For I have no one of a like spirit, who will with a kind of natural affection take care of your affairs.

21. For all seek their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus.

22. But ye know the proof I have had of him, that as son with a father he served with me in the gospel.

23. I hope therefore to send him as soon as I see the issue of my own affairs.

24. But I trust in the Lord, that I shall soon come myself too.

25. However, I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother, and fellow-laborer, and fellow-soldier, but your messenger, who ministred to my wants:

26. for he much longed after you all, and was greatly concerned because ye had heard that he was sick.

27. For indeed he was sick and nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.

28. I have sent him therefore the more desirously, that when ye see him again ye may rejoice, and I may be the less sorrowful.

29. Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and have such in high esteem:

30. because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his own life, so that he might fill up what was wanting in your kind offices towards me. 

## Philippians 3

1. Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is not irksome to me, and for you it is safe.

2. Beware of those that are like dogs, beware of evil doers, beware of the concision.

3. For we are of the true circumcision, who worship God in spirit, rejoicing in Christ Jesus, and having no confidence in the flesh.

4. Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other thinks he hath whereof to trust in the flesh, I more:

5. having been circumcised on the eighth day, of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of Hebrews, with respect to the law a pharisee,

6. as to zeal persecuting the church, as to the righteousness of the law blameless: but those things,

7. which were once gain to me, I counted loss for Christ.

8. Yea doubtless and I count all but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all, and I account them but dung, that I may gain Christ, and be found in Him,

9. not having my own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is by the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: that I may know Him,

10. and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;

11. if by any means I may attain to the resurrection of the dead:

12. not that I have yet won the prize, or am already perfect: but I press forward to acquire that perfection, for which also I have been apprehended by Christ Jesus.

13. Brethren, I count not myself to have attained it: but one thing I do, forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to those before,

14. I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

15. Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, attend to this: and if in any thing ye think differently, God will reveal this also unto you.

16. But in what we have attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.

17. Brethren, be imitators of me, and observe those that walk as ye have us for an example.

18. (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: whose end is destruction,

19. whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame; who mind earthly things) For our conversation is in heaven,

20. from whence also we expect the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ: who will change our vile body,

21. that it may be made like his glorious body, according to the energy of his ability to subdue all things to Himself. 

## Philippians 4

1. Wherefore, my brethren, beloved and much desired, my joy and crown, so stand ye fast in the Lord, my beloved.

2. I exhort Euodia, and Syntyche to be perfectly united in the Lord.

3. And I entreat thee likewise, my faithful collegue, to assist them, for they laboured with me in the gospel, and Clement also, and my other fellow-laborers, whose names are in the book of life.

4. Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say, Rejoice.

5. Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.

6. Be anxious in nothing: but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known before God.

7. And the peace of God, which surpasseth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.

8. Finally my brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are venerable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are friendly, whatever things are reputable, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think of these things:

9. and what ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these practise; and the God of peace will be with you.

10. I rejoiced greatly in the Lord, that your care for me has now flourished again; for whom ye were indeed careful before, but ye wanted opportunity.

11. Not that I speak on account of want; for I have learnt in whatever circumstances I am, to be contented.

12. I know both how to be abased, and how to abound: in every place, and in all conditions I am instructed, both to be full and to be hungry, to abound and to be in want.

13. I can do all things through Christ strengthening me.

14. Nevertheless ye did well in communicating to the relief of my affliction.

15. And ye Philippians know, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I was departing from Macedonia, no church communicated to me on the score of giving and receiving, but you only.

16. For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again to supply my wants.

17. Not that I desire a gift, but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.

18. And indeed I have it all, and now abound: I am fully supplied, having received of Epaphroditus the things sent by you, a fragrant odor, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.

19. And my God will supply all your wants, according to his riches, in glory, by Christ Jesus.

20. Now to our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

21. Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren that are with me salute you:

22. and all the saints here salute you, but especially those of Cesar's household.

23. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
