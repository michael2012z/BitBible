# Revelation

## Revelation 1

1. The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto Him, to shew to his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and He sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John,

2. who bare witness to the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, and to whatever He saw.

3. Happy is he that readeth, and those that hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things that are written therein: for the time is near.

4. John to the seven churches in Asia---Grace and peace be to you, from Him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;

5. and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the first-born from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,

6. and hath made us kings and priests to his God and Father, to Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

7. Behold, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye shall see Him, even they that pierced Him: and all the tribes of the earth shall lament before Him. Even so, Amen!

8. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, saith the Lord, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.

9. I John, who am also your brother, and companion in the affliction, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the island called Patmos, for the sake of the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.

10. Here I was in the Spirit on the Lord's-day: and heard behind me a loud voice, as of a trumpet,

11. saying, I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last; and, What thou seest write in a book, and send it to the seven churches in Asia, to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.

12. And I turned to see the voice that spake to me: and when I turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;

13. and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like the Son of man, clothed with a long robe, and girded about the breasts with a golden girdle.

14. His head and his hairs were white like white wool, as white as snow; and his eyes as a flame of fire;

15. and his feet like fine brass, as if they were glowing in a furnace: and his voice as the sound of many waters:

16. and He had in his right hand seven stars, and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun when he shineth in his strength.

17. And when I saw Him, I fell at his feet as dead; and He laid his right hand upon me, and said to me, "Fear not,

18. I am the first and the last, who live, though I was dead; and behold, I am alive for ever and ever, Amen, and have the keys of hades and of death.

19. Write what thou hast seen, the things which are, and which are to be hereafter."

20. As to the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks; the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches. 

## Revelation 2

1. To the angel of the church at Ephesus write, These things saith He that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;

2. I know thy works, and thy labor, and thy patience, and that thou canst not bear those that are evil: and thou hast tried those who say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars; and hast borne trouble, and hast patience;

3. and for my name's sake thou hast laboured, and hast not fainted.

4. Yet I have somewhat against thee; for thou hast left thy first love.

5. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works: else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of its place, if thou repent not.

6. But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.

7. Let him, that hath an ear, hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.

8. And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write, These things saith the First and the Last, who was dead and is alive;

9. I know thy works and affliction and poverty (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of those that say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.

10. Fear none of the things which thou wilt suffer: behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall suffer affliction ten days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.

11. Let him, that hath an ear, hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. He, that overcometh, shall not be hurt by the second death.

12. And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write, These things saith He, who hath the sharp two-edged sword;

13. I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and yet thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr; who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.

14. But I have a few things against thee; for thou hast there those that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.

15. So thou hast also them that hold the like doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which I hate.

16. Repent therefore---if not, I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword that goeth out of my mouth.

17. Let him, that hath an ear, hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna: and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knoweth, but He that receiveth it.

18. And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write, These things saith the Son of God, who hath eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet like fine brass; I know thy works,

19. and thy love, and thy service, and thy faith, and thy patience, and that thy last works are more than the first.

20. But I have a few things against thee; because thou sufferest the woman Jezabel, who saith that she is a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed to idols.

21. And I gave her time to repent of her fornication, and she repented not.

22. Behold I will cast her into a bed, and those that commit whoredom with her, into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds:

23. and I will cut off her children by death; and all the churches shall know, that I am He who searcheth the reins and hearts, and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.

24. But to you I say, to the rest in Thyatira, As many as do not hold this doctrine, and who are unacquainted with the depths of Satan, as they speak, I will lay on you no other burden:

25. but what ye have hold fast till I come.

26. And to him that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, will I give power over the nations:

27. and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken in pieces; as I also have received of my Father;

28. and I will give him the morning-star.

29. Let him, that hath an ear, hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. 

## Revelation 3

1. And to the angel of the church in Sardis write, These things saith He that hath the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead:

2. be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die; for I have not found thy works perfect in the sight of God.

3. Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent: for if thou be not watchful, I will come upon thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come upon thee.

4. Thou hast a few names even in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with me in white; for they are worthy.

5. He that overcometh shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name from the book of life; but I will own his name before my Father, and before his angels.

6. Let him, that hath an ear, hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

7. And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write, These things saith the holy One, He that is true, He that hath the key of David, He that openeth and no one shutteth, and shutteth and no one openeth:

8. I know thy works, and behold I have given thee an open door, and no one shall be able to shut it; for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.

9. Behold, I will give up those of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews, and are not, but speak falsely; behold, I will make them come and bow before thy feet, and they shall know that I have loved thee.

10. Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which is to come upon the whole world, to try those that dwell upon the earth.

11. Behold, I come quickly; hold fast what thou hast, that no one may take thy crown.

12. Him, that overcometh, I will make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, (the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God,) and my own new name.

13. Let him, that hath an ear, hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

14. And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write, These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God; I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot:

15. I wish thou wert cold or hot.

16. So then, because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will cast thee out of my mouth:

17. because thou sayst, I am rich, and wealthy, and have want of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.

18. I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayst be rich; and white raiment that thou mayst be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness may not appear: and anoint thine eyes with eye-salve, that thou mayst see.

19. Whomsoever I love, I reprove and chasten: be zealous therefore and repent.

20. Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any one hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.

21. To him that overcometh I will grant to sit with me on my throne, as I also have overcome, and am set down with my Father on his throne.

22. Let him, that hath an ear, hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. 

## Revelation 4

1. After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven; and the first voice which I heard was as of a trumpet speaking to me; and it said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must come to pass hereafter.

2. And immmediately I was in the Spirit: and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne.

3. And He that sat upon it, was to look at like a jasper and a sardine stone, and there was a rainbow round the throne like the appearance of an emerald.

4. And around the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw twenty four elders sitting, clothed in white garments; and they had upon their heads crowns of gold.

5. And out of the throne came lightnings, and thunders, and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne; which are the seven spirits of God.

6. And before the throne was a sea of glass, like crystal: and in the middle of the throne, and the circle of it, were four animate beings full of eyes before and behind.

7. And the first was like a lion, and the second like a calf, and the third had a face like a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle.

8. And the four animals had each of them six wings round about, and within were full of eyes; and they cease not day and night saying, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come.

9. And when the animals give glory and honor and thanks to Him that sitteth on the throne,

10. who liveth for ever and ever, the four and twenty elders fall down before Him that sitteth on the throne, and worship Him that liveth for ever and ever,

11. and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Worthy art thou, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for thou hast created all things, and by thy will they exist, and were created. 

## Revelation 5

1. And I saw on the right hand of Him that sat on the throne a book written within and without, sealed with seven seals:

2. and I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals of it?

3. And no one in heaven, nor on earth, nor under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look into it:

4. and I wept much because no one was found worthy to open and read the book, nor to look into it.

5. And one of the elders said to me, Weep not;---Behold the lion of the tribe of Juda, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose its seven seals.

6. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four animals, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb, as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.

7. And He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him that sat upon the throne.

8. And when He had taken the book, the four animals, and the twenty four elders, fell down before the Lamb, having every one harps and golden vials full of perfumes, which are the prayers of the saints.

9. And they sung a new song, saying, Worthy art thou to take the book, and to open its seals; for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation;

10. and hast made us to our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.

11. And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round the throne and the animals and the elders: and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands;

12. saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing.

13. And I heard every creature in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all that are in them, saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb, for ever and ever.

14. And the four animals said, Amen: and the twenty four elders fell down and worshipped Him that liveth to endless ages. 

## Revelation 6

1. And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard one of the four animate beings saying, as with a voice of thunder, Come and see.

2. And I saw, and behold a white horse; and He that sat upon it had a bow, and a crown was given Him, and He went forth conquering and to conquer.

3. And when He opened the second seal, I heard the second animal saying, Come and see.

4. And there came out another horse, which was red: and it was given to him, that sat upon it, to take peace from the earth, that they should kill one another: and there was given him a great sword.

5. And when He opened the third seal, I heard the third animal say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo, a black horse, and he that sat upon it had a balance in his hand.

6. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four animals saying, One measure of wheat for a denary, and but three measures of barley for a denary: but see that thou hurt not the oil and the wine.

7. And when He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth animal saying, Come and see.

8. And I saw, and behold a pale horse, and the name of him that sat upon it was Death, and Hades followed him: and power was given them to slay a fourth part of the earth, by sword, and by famine, and by pestilence, and by wild beasts.

9. And when He opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those that had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they maintained.

10. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on those that dwell upon the earth?

11. And white robes were given to each of them, and it was told them to rest a little while longer, till the number of their fellow-servants, and their brethren that should be killed as they were, should be complete.

12. And I saw when He opened the sixth seal, and behold there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as sack-cloth of hair, and the moon was red as blood;

13. and the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig-tree droppeth it's unripe figs, when shaken by a strong wind;

14. and the heaven passed away as a book rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places:

15. and the kings of the earth, and the grandees, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every slave, and every free man, hid themselves in the caverns and in the rocks of the mountains;

16. and said to the mountains and to the rocks, "Fall upon us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:

17. for the great day of his wrath is come, and who can stand before Him?" 

## Revelation 7

1. And after these things, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind might not blow upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree.

2. And I saw another angel which ascended from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,

3. saying, Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.

4. And I heard the number of those that were sealed; and there were an hundred forty and four thousand sealed out of all the tribes of the children of Israel.

5. Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand: of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand: of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand:

6. of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand: of the tribe of Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand: of the tribe of Manasseh were sealed twelve thousand:

7. of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand: of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand: of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand:

8. of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand: of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand: of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.

9. After this I beheld, and lo, a great multitude, which no one could number, out of all nations, and tribes, and people, and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and with palms in their hands;

10. and crying with a loud voice, saying, Salvation be ascribed to our God, who sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb.

11. And all the angels stood round the throne, and round the elders, and the four animate beings; and fell on their faces before the throne, and worshipped God, saying, Amen:

12. Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and strength be ascribed to our God for ever and ever. Amen.

13. And one of the elders said unto me, Who are these that are clothed in white robes, and from whence did they come?

14. And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they who come out of great affliction, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

15. Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in his temple: and He that sitteth upon the throne shall dwell among them.

16. They shall hunger no more, nor thirst any more, nor shall the sun nor any violent heat fall upon them.

17. For the Lamb, that is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them to fountains of living waters: and God will wipe off every tear from their eyes. 

## Revelation 8

1. And when He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour:

2. and I saw the seven angels, that stood before God; and seven trumpets were given to them.

3. And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to Him much incense, that He might present it with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar, which was before the throne.

4. And the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints, out of the hand of the angel, before God.

5. And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it upon the earth: and there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings, and an earthquake.

6. And the seven angels, that had the seven trumpets, prepared themselves to sound their trumpets.

7. And the first angel sounded his trumpet, and there was hail and fire mingled with blood, and it was cast down upon the earth: and a third part of the trees and every green herb was burnt up.

8. And the second angel sounded, and I saw as it were a great mountain on fire cast into the sea, and a third part of the sea became blood.

9. And a third part of the creatures in the sea, that had life, died; and a third part of the ships were destroyed.

10. And the third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star burning like a torch, and it fell upon a third part of the rivers, and the fountains of waters: and the name of the star is Wormwood;

11. and a third part of the waters became as wormwood: and many men died of the waters, because they were bitter.

12. And the fourth angel sounded, and a third part of the sun was smitten, and a third part of the moon, and a third part of the stars; so that the third part of them was darkened, and the day lost a third part of it's light, and the night likewise.

13. And I beheld, and heard an angel flying in the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice, Wo, wo, wo to the inhabitants on the earth from the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, that are yet to sound. 

## Revelation 9

1. And the fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth: and the key of the bottomless pit was given to him.

2. And he opened the bottomless pit: and there came up smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit.

3. And out of the smoke there came forth locusts upon the earth; and power was given them, even as the scorpions of the earth have power.

4. And order was given them, not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree; but only the men, who had not the seal of God on their foreheads.

5. And to them was given power, not to kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it striketh a man.

6. And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it: and they shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.

7. And the resemblance of the locusts was like horses prepared for war; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces as the faces of men.

8. And they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.

9. And they had breast-plates like breast-plates of iron; and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, with many horses running to battle.

10. And they had tails like scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.

11. And they had a king over them, the angel of the bottomless pit; whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek tongue Apollyon.

12. Thus one wo is past, but behold two woes more are coming after.

13. And the sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a certain voice from the four horns of the golden altar, which is before God,

14. saying to the sixth angel, who had the trumpet, Let loose the four angels, that are bound by the great river Euphrates.

15. And the four angels were let loose; who were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, to kill the third part of men.

16. And the number of their armies was two hundred millions: for I heard the number of them.

17. And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those that sat on them, that is, having breast-plates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire, and smoke, and brimstone.

18. And by these three things, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which came out of their mouths, the third part of men were killed.

19. For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails also; for their tails are like serpents, having heads: and with these likewise they do mischief.

20. And the rest of the men, who were not killed by these plagues, yet repented not of the works of their hands, so as not to worship demons, and idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk:

21. neither did they repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their whoredom, nor of their thefts. 

## Revelation 10

1. And I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven invested with a cloud: and there was a rainbow on his head, and his face was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire.

2. And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the earth.

3. And he cried with a loud voice like the roaring of a lion; and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.

4. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was going to write: but I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up what the seven thunders spake, and write them not.

5. And the angel which I saw standing on the sea and on the earth,

6. lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by Him that liveth for ever, who created the heaven and the things therein, and the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things therein, that there shall be time no longer:

7. but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall sound his trumpet, the mystery of God shall be finished, as He hath declared to his servants the prophets.

8. And the voice, which I heard from heaven, spake to me again, and said, Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.

9. And I went to the angel, and said to him, Give me the little book. And he said to me, Take it, and eat it up: and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it will be sweet as honey.

10. And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up: and it was in my mouth sweet as honey, and when I had eaten it my belly was bitter.

11. And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again of many people and nations and tongues and kings. 

## Revelation 11

1. And there was given me a reed like a measuring rod; and the angel stood and said, Rise and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and the extent of those that worship at it.

2. But leave the outer court of the temple, and measure it not, for it is given to the gentiles: and they shall trample on the holy city forty two months.

3. And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.

4. These are the two olive-trees, and two candlesticks that stand before the God of the earth.

5. And if any one seek to injure them, fire cometh out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: yea, if any one shall desire to injure them, thus shall he be slain.

6. These have power to shut the heavens, so that no rain may fall in the days of their prophecy: and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague as often as they will.

7. And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the abyss, will make war against them, and overcome them, and kill them.

8. And their dead bodies shall fall in the street of the great city, which is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.

9. And various people, and tribes, and tongues, and nations, shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and not suffer their corpses to be buried.

10. And those that dwell upon the earth shall triumph over them, and be merry, and send presents to one another: because these two prophets had tormented those that dwelt on the earth.

11. But after three days and an half the spirit of life from God entered into them: and they stood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon those that saw them.

12. And they heard a great voice from heaven, saying to them, Come up hither; and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies beheld them.

13. And at that time there was a great earthquake, and a tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were killed seven thousand men: and the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven.

14. The second wo is past, and behold the third wo is coming quickly.

15. And the seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of the world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Anointed, and He shall reign for ever and ever.

16. And the four and twenty elders, who sat before God on their thrones, fell on their faces, and worshipped God,

17. saying, We give thanks unto thee, O Lord God almighty, who art, and who wast, and who art to come; because thou hast assumed thy great power, and hast reigned.

18. The nations were enraged, but thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and to give a reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to those that fear thy name, small and great; and to destroy them that destroy the earth.

19. And the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail. 

## Revelation 12

1. And there appeared a great sign in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.

2. And being with child, she cried out in travail, labouring to be delivered.

3. And there appeared another sign in heaven, and behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns; and upon his heads seven crowns.

4. And his tail drew a third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman, who was ready to bring forth, that when she was delivered, he might devour her child.

5. And she brought forth a male child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.

6. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they might nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.

7. And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels fought against the dragon: and the dragon fought, and his angels;

8. but these prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in heaven.

9. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil and Satan, who deceiveth the whole world: he was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him.

10. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, who accused them before our God day and night.

11. And they have overcome him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony, and they loved not their life unto the death.

12. Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them: but wo to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea; for the devil is come down to you, in great rage, knowing that he hath but a short time.

13. Now when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth, he persecuted the woman that brought forth the male-child:

14. and there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is to be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.

15. And the serpent threw water out of his mouth, like a river, after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood.

16. But the earth helped the woman, and opened it's mouth, and swallowed up the flood, which the dragon threw out of his mouth.

17. Then the dragon was enraged against the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God, and who have the testimony of Jesus Christ. 

## Revelation 13

1. And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, which had seven heads and ten horns; and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the names of blasphemy.

2. And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority.

3. And I saw one of his heads as it were mortally wounded, but his deadly wound was healed: and all the earth wondered and went after the beast.

4. And they worshipped the dragon, who gave his power to the beast, and they worshipped the beast likewise, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war against him?

5. And there was given him a mouth speaking great and blasphemous things, and power was given him to make war forty two months.

6. And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and those that dwell in heaven.

7. And he was permitted to make war upon the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over every tribe, and tongue, and nation.

8. So that all who dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

9. If any one hath an ear, let him hear. Whosoever leadeth into captivity shall go away into captivity:

10. and he, that killeth with the sword, shall be slain with the sword. Here then is the patience and faith of the saints.

11. And I saw another beast ascending out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb; but he spake like a dragon.

12. And he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast in his presence; and makes the earth, and those that dwell in it, to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.

13. And he doth great wonders, so that even maketh fire to come down from heaven to earth in the sight of men; and deceiveth those that dwell on the earth,

14. by the signs which it was given him to do in the presence of the beast, telling the inhabitants of the earth to make an image to the beast, that had received the wound of the sword, and yet lived.

15. And he was permitted to give life to the image of the beast, that it might both speak, and cause all those who would not worship the image of the beast to be slain.

16. And he maketh all, both small and great, rich and poor, free-men and slaves, to receive a mark on their right hand, or on their foreheads: and that no one might buy or sell,

17. but he that hath the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

18. Here is wisdom required; and let him, that hath understanding, compute the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred sixty six. 

## Revelation 14

1. Then I looked and behold a Lamb standing on mount Sion, and with Him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written on their foreheads.

2. And I heard a voice from heaven, like the noise of many waters, and as the sound of great thunder; and I heard the sound of harpers playing on their harps:

3. and they sung as it were a new song before the throne; and before the four living ones, and the elders: and none could learn the song, but the hundred and forty four thousand, who are redeemed from the earth.

4. These are they who were not defiled with women; for they are virgins: these are they who follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth: these were redeemed from among men, as the first-fruits unto God and the Lamb.

5. And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are blameless before the throne of God.

6. And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel, to preach to those that dwell upon the earth, to every nation, and tribe, and tongue,

7. and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the time of his judgement is come: and worship Him that made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.

8. And another angel followed, saying, Babylon the great city is fallen, is fallen; because she made all nations drink of the wine of her furious fornication.

9. And a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any one worship the beast and his image, and receive the mark on his forehead,

10. or on his hand, he also shall drink of the wine of God's indignation poured forth without mixture, in the cup of his wrath; and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone, in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.

11. And the smoke of their torment ascendeth for ever and ever: and they have no rest, day and night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

12. Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

13. And I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead, that die in the Lord, from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, for they rest from their labors and their works do follow them.

14. And I saw, and behold, a white cloud, and one sitting on the cloud like the Son of man; having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.

15. And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him that sat upon the cloud, Put in thy sickle and reap; for the time to reap is come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.

16. And He that sat upon the cloud put forth his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.

17. And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle.

18. And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over the fire; and he called out with a loud cry to Him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Put in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for its grapes are ripe.

19. And the angel put forth his sickle to the earth, and stript the vine of the earth, and cast the grapes into the great wine-press of God's wrath.

20. And the wine-press was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the wine-press, even to the horses bridles, a thousand six hundred furlongs off. 

## Revelation 15

1. And I saw another sign in heaven great and wonderful, ---seven angels, having the seven last plagues, for in them the wrath of God is finished.

2. And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and those that had gained the victory from the beast, and from his image, and from his mark, and from the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, and having harps to celebrate the praises of God.

3. And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, "Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God almighty; just and true are thy ways, O king of saints: who should not fear thee,

4. O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: and all the nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy righteous judgements are made manifest."

5. And after these things I saw, and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.

6. And the seven angels, who had the seven plagues, came out of the temple, clothed in linen pure and bright, and girded about their breasts with girdles of gold.

7. And one of the four living beings gave to the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.

8. And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from the display of his power: so that no one could enter into the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished. 

## Revelation 16

1. And I heard a great voice from the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.

2. And the first angel went forth and poured out his vial upon the earth, and there was a sore and grievous ulcer inflicted upon the men that had the mark of the beast, and upon them that worshipped his image.

3. And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became blood like that of a dead man: and every living soul in the sea died.

4. And the third angel poured out his vial on the rivers and on the fountains of waters; and they became blood.

5. And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous art Thou, O Lord, who art, and who ever wast; and who art holy, for Thou hast ordered these things: because they have shed the blood of saints and prophets,

6. and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.

7. And I heard another from the altar, saying, Yea, O Lord God almighty, true and just are thy judgements.

8. And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given him to scorch men with fire.

9. And men were scorched with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God, who hath power over these plagues, and they repented not to give Him glory.

10. And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was darkened, and they gnawed their tongues for pain.

11. And they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores; and they repented not of their works.

12. And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and its water was dried up, that the way of the kings from the east might be prepared.

13. And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three impure spirits like frogs:

14. for they are the spirits of demons, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to bring them together to the battle of that great day of God almighty.

15. "Behold, I come as a thief: blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, that he may not walk naked, and his shame be seen."

16. And he gathered them together into a place called in Hebrew Armageddon.

17. And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came forth a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.

18. And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as never was since there were men upon the earth, so violent and so great.

19. And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came into remembrance before God, to give her the cup of the wine of his fierce wrath.

20. And every island fled, and the mountains were not found.

21. And great hail-stones of a talent weight came down from heaven upon men: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great. 

## Revelation 17

1. And there came one of the seven angels, that had the seven vials, and talked with me and said, Come hither, and I will shew thee the judgement of the great harlot, that sitteth upon many waters:

2. with whom the kings of the earth have committed whoredom, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her whoredom.

3. And he transported me in spirit into the wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-coloured beast, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns.

4. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of the stench and filth of her whoredom.

5. And upon her forehead was a name written, "Mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of harlots, and of the abominations of the earth."

6. And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great amazement.

7. And the angel said unto me, Why dost thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.

8. The beast, which thou sawest, was, and is not; but will rise out of the abyss, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth (whose names are not written on the book of life from the foundation of the world) shall wonder, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is to be.

9. To this the mind that hath wisdom will attend: for the seven heads are seven hills, on which the woman sitteth.

10. And there are seven kings: five are fallen, one is, and another is not yet come; and when he cometh, he is to continue but a little while.

11. And the beast that was, and is not, he is the eighth, and is as one of the seven, and goeth into perdition.

12. And the ten horns, which thou sawest, are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom, but shall receive power as kings for a limited time with the beast.

13. These are of one mind, and will give their power and authority to the beast.

14. These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for He is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and those that are with Him are called, and chosen, and faithful.

15. And he said unto me, The waters which thou sawest, whereon the harlot sitteth, are people, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.

16. And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall devour her flesh, and burn her with fire.

17. For God hath put it into their hearts to do according to his mind, and to perform one and the same purpose, even to give their kingdoms to the beast, till the words of God be accomplished.

18. And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which beareth rule over the kings of the earth. 

## Revelation 18

1. And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was enlightened with his glory.

2. And he cried with vehemence, and with a loud voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of demons, a den of impure spirits, and a cage for every unclean and hateful bird.

3. For all nations have drunk of the wine of her furious whoredom, and the kings of the earth have committed whoredom with her, and the merchants of the earth are grown rich by the abundance of her luxury.

4. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out from her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye may not suffer by her plagues:

5. for her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.

6. Give to her as she hath given to you, and repay her double according to her works: in the cup, which she hath mixed, mix for her double.

7. As much as she hath glorified herself and indulged to luxury, so much torment and sorrow give her; because she saith in her heart, I sit as a queen, I am not a widow, and I shall see no sorrow.

8. Therefore in one day shall her plagues come, even death and mourning and famine; and she shall be burnt with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.

9. And the kings of the earth, who have committed lewdness and lived luxuriously with her, shall bemoan her and lament for her, when they see the smoke of her burning;

10. standing afar off for fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, the great city Babylon, that powerful city! for in one hour is thy judgement come.

11. And the merchants of the earth shall bewail and mourn over her, because no one will buy their merchandize any more:

12. the lading of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and pearl, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and all sorts of thyine wood, and vessels of ivory, and of the most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;

13. and their cinnamon, and perfumes, and sweet ointment, and incense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, yea and the souls of men.

14. And the fruits, which thy soul longed after, are gone from thee, and all thy delicate and splendid things are departed, and thou shalt find them no more.

15. The merchants of these things, who grew rich by their trade with her, shall stand afar off for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,

16. and saying, Alas, alas, the great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and adorned with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!

17. for in one hour is so great wealth laid waste. And every pilot, and all on board the ships, and the mariners, and all that traffic by sea, stood afar off,

18. and cried out, when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like to this great city?

19. And they threw dust on their heads, and cried out, weeping and moaning, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, in which all that had ships at sea were enriched by her sumptuous expences! for in one hour she is become desolate.

20. Rejoice over her, O heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets, for God hath avenged you on her.

21. And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great milstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus shall the great city Babylon be thrown down with violence, and never be found more.

22. And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard in thee no more: and no artist of any art whatsoever shall be found in thee any more; and the sound of a milstone shall be heard in thee no more.

23. And the light of a candle shall be seen in thee no more; and the voice of the bridegroom and bride shall be heard no more in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth, and by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.

24. And herein was found the blood of prophets and saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth. 

## Revelation 19

1. And after these things I heard a loud voice as of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Alleluia; salvation, and glory, and honor, and power to the Lord our God: for true and righteous are his judgements;

2. He hath judged the great whore, who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand:

3. (and again they said, Alleluia:) and her smoke ascendeth for ever and ever.

4. And the four and twenty elders, and the four animals fell down and worshipped God that sat upon the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.

5. And a voice came out from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear Him, both small and great.

6. And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the noise of many waters, and as the sound of mighty thunders, saying, Alleluia, for the Lord God the almighty reigneth.

7. Let us rejoice and exult and give glory to Him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.

8. And it was given to her, that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and bright: for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints.

9. And he said unto me, Write, Happy they who are invited to the marriage-supper of the Lamb. And he said unto me, These are the true words of God.

10. And I fell at his feet to worship him: and he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellow-servant, and a fellow-servant of thy brethren, that hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God. For the Spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus.

11. And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and He that sat upon it is called faithful and true, and in righteousness doth He judge and make war.

12. His eyes are as a flame of fire, and many crowns on his head: and He hath a name written, which none knoweth but Himself.

13. And He was clothed with a vesture dipt in blood: and his name is called, "The Word of God."

14. And the armies in heaven followed Him on white horses, clothed in fine linen white and clean.

15. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that He may smite the nations therewith: and He shall rule them with a rod of iron: and He treadeth the wine-press of the indignation and wrath of God almighty.

16. And He hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, "King of kings, and Lord of lords."

17. And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together to the banquet of the great God;

18. that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those that sit upon them, and the flesh of all, both freemen and slaves, both small and great.

19. And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together to make war with him that sitteth upon the horse, and against his army.

20. And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet, who had wrought signs before him, by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast, and those who worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone.

21. And the rest were slain with the sword of Him that sitteth upon the horse, the sword that cometh out of his mouth: and all the fowls of heaven were satiated with their flesh. 

## Revelation 20

1. And I saw an angel come down from heaven, who had the key of the bottomless pit, and a great chain in his hand.

2. And he seized the dragon, that old serpent, who is the devil and satan, and bound him a thousand years,

3. and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he might deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years be finished: and then he must be loosed for a little time.

4. And I saw thrones, and persons sat on them, and judgement was given to them: and I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God; and who had not worshipped the beast, nor his image, and received not his mark upon their forehead, and on their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.

5. But the rest of the dead lived not again till the thousand years be finished.

6. This is the first resurrection. Happy and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on these the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years.

7. And when the thousand years are ended,

8. Satan shall be loosed from his confinement, and shall go forth to deceive the nations, that are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to war, whose number is as the sand of the sea.

9. And they overspread the surface of the earth, and encompassed the camp of the saints, and the beloved city: but fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.

10. And the devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

11. And I saw a great white throne, and Him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled, and no place was found for them.

12. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged by the things written in the books, according to their works.

13. And the sea gave up the dead that were in it; and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them: and they were judged every one according to their works.

14. And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire: this is the second death.

15. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life, was cast into the lake of fire. 

## Revelation 21

1. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the former heaven and the former earth passed away, and there was no more sea.

2. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, descending from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.

3. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be his people, and God himself, even their God, will be with them.

4. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there shall be death no more, nor sorrow, nor crying, nor any more pain: for the former things are passed away.

5. And He that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And He said to me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.

6. And He said to me, It is done. I am the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end: I will give to him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.

7. He that overcometh shall inherit all things, and I will be a God to him, and he shall be to me a son.

8. But the fearful, and faithless, and abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.

9. And there came unto me one of the seven angels, who had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and he spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.

10. And he carried me away in spirit to a great and high mountain, and he shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, having the glory of God:

11. and her light was like a most precious stone, even as a Jasper-stone resembling crystal:

12. having also a great and high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and there were names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.

13. On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.

14. And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

15. And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and it's gates, and it's wall.

16. And the city was four-square, it's length being as much as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs: the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.

17. And he measured the wall of it an hundred forty four cubits according to the measure of a man, for such was that of the angel.

18. And the structure of its wall was of Jasper, and the city pure gold, like transparent glass.

19. And the foundations of the wall of the city were set off each with precious stones: the first foundation a jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony,

20. the fourth an emerald, the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprasus, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth an amethyst.

21. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each of the gates was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold like resplendent glass.

22. And I saw no temple in it: for the Lord God almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple of it.

23. And the city hath no need of the sun, nor of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God enlighteneth it, and the Lamb is it's light.

24. And the nations of those that are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth bring their glory and their honor into it.

25. And the gates of it are not to be shut by day: for there shall be no night there.

26. And they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.

27. And nothing shall enter into it that defileth, and practiseth abomination and falshood: but those only who are written in the Lamb's book of life. 

## Revelation 22

1. And he shewed me a pure river of the water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God, and of the Lamb.

2. And in the midst of the street, and of the river, which ran on each side, was the tree of life, producing fruits twelve times in the year, yielding its different fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.

3. And every curse shall cease: and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall serve Him.

4. And they shall see his face; and his name shall be on their foreheads.

5. And there shall be no night there: and they have no need of a candle, nor of the light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light; and they shall reign for ever and ever.

6. And he said unto me, These words are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets hath sent his angel to shew unto his servants what must soon be.

7. For behold I come quickly: happy is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book.

8. And I John am he who saw and heard these things: and when I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel, who shewed me these things.

9. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: for I am a fellow-servant of thine, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of those who observe the words of this book: worship God.

10. And he said unto me, Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book; for the time is near.

11. Let him, that is unjust, be unjust still: and let him, that is filthy, be filthy still: and let him, that is righteous, be righteous still; and let him, that is holy, be holy still.

12. And behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to recompense every one according to his work.

13. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.

14. Happy are they that do his commandments, so shall they have a right to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates into the city.

15. But without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and every one that loveth and practiseth falshood.

16. I Jesus have sent my messenger to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am both the root and the offspring of David, the bright and morning star.

17. And the Spirit and the bride say, Come; and let him that heareth say, Come. And let him, that thirsteth, Come. And let him, that desireth it, take the water of life freely.

18. I testify to every one that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any one add to these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:

19. and if any one take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things that are written in this book.

20. He who testifieth these things saith, I surely come quickly. Amen, even so come, Lord Jesus.

21. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
