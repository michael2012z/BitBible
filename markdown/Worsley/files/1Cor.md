## 1 Corinthians 1

1. Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother, to the church of God which is in Corinth,

2. even to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, and called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is both their Lord and ours;

3. grace and peace be to you from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ.

4. I always give thanks unto my God, on your account, for the grace of God bestowed on you in Christ Jesus; that ye are enriched by Him with every gift,

5. in all utterance and knowledge;

6. (even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed among you;)

7. so that ye are deficient in no gift, expecting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ:

8. who will also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ;

9. for God is faithful by whom ye were called into the communion of his son Jesus Christ our Lord.

10. Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye would all say alike, and that there may be no schisms among you, but that ye be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same judgement.

11. For I have been informed concerning you, my brethren, by some of Chloe's family, that there are contentions among you.

12. I mean, that each of you saith, as if of different parties, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, I of Cephas, and I of Christ.

13. Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?

14. I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius:

15. so that no one can say I baptized in my own name.

16. I also baptized indeed the family of Stephanas: but I know not whether I baptized any other.

17. For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in fine speech, least the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.

18. For the doctrine of the cross is to them, that perish, foolishness: but to us, who are saved, it is the power of God.

19. For it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."

20. Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputant of the age? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?

21. For, since in the wisdom of God the world by it's wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by what they called the folly of preaching to save those that believe.

22. And whereas the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks look for wisdom, we preach Christ crucified;

23. to the Jews indeed a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness; but to them that are called,

24. both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.

25. Because the foolishness of God, as they call it, is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.

26. For ye see by your calling, brethren, that not many wise men according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called:

27. but God hath chosen things that are foolish in the eye of the world to put it's wise men to confusion; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the mighty;

28. and things in the opinion of the world ignoble, and despicable, and accounted as nothing, hath God chosen, to abolish things that are in esteem among men;

29. that no flesh may glory in his presence.

30. But ye are of Him in Christ Jesus, who from God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:

31. that, as it is written, He that glorieth may glory in the Lord. 

## 1 Corinthians 2

1. And I, when I came among you, brethren, came not with excellency of language, or of human wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God:

2. for I did not think it meet to know any thing among you, but Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.

3. And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.

4. And my discourse, and my preaching was not with the persuasive words of human wisdom, but in the demonstration of the Spirit and of power;

5. that your faith might not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.

6. Yet we speak true wisdom among the perfect: though not the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who come to nought.

7. But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, that hidden wisdom which God ordained before the worlds for our glory:

8. which none of the rulers of this age knew; for if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.

9. But as it is written, "Eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, nor have entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for those that love Him."

10. But God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, even the deep things of God.

11. For who among men knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man which is in him? so also the things of God no one knoweth, but the Spirit of God.

12. Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit of God; that we might know the things that are graciously bestowed upon us by God:

13. which we also speak of, not in words dictated by human wisdom, but in those which are dictated by the holy Spirit; explaining spiritual things by spiritual words.

14. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.

15. Whereas the spiritual man discerneth all things, yet is himself discerned by no one.

16. For who hath known the mind of the Lord, to instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. 

## 1 Corinthians 3

1. And I, my brethren, could not speak to you, as to spiritual persons, but as to carnal ones, even as to babes in Christ.

2. I have fed you with milk, and not with meat; for ye were not hitherto able to bear it, nor yet are ye even now able.

3. Because ye are still carnal: for while there is among you envy and strife and divisions, are ye not carnal, and do ye not walk as men?

4. For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos, are ye not carnal?

5. Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whose means ye embraced the faith, even as the Lord gave success to each of them?

6. I have planted, Apollos watered: but God gave the increase.

7. So that neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.

8. And he that planteth, and he that watereth, are as one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.

9. For we are fellow-laborers, the servants of God: and ye are the husbandry of God, ye are the building of God.

10. According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise architect I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon: but let every one see to it how he buildeth thereon.

11. For no one can lay any other foundation, but that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ: and if any build upon this foundation gold,

12. silver, precious stones, or wood, hay, stubble;

13. every man's work shall be made manifest. For the great day will shew it; because it will be discovered by fire, and the fire will prove every man's work of what sort it is.

14. If any man's work abide, which he hath built upon it, he shall receive a reward:

15. but if any man's work be burnt, he will be damaged; though he himself shall be saved, but, as it were out of fire.

16. Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?

17. If any one destroy the temple of God, him will God destroy: for the temple of God is holy, and this temple are ye.

18. Let no one deceive himself: if any among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be truly wise.

19. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written, "He taketh the wise in their own craftiness:"

20. and again, "The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain."

21. Therefore let no one glory in men: for all things are yours;

22. whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or future, all are yours;

23. and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's. 

## 1 Corinthians 4

1. Let a man so account of us, as the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.

2. Now it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.

3. But to me it is of very small moment to be judged by you, or by any man's judgement; nor indeed do I judge myself:

4. (for I am conscious to myself of nothing; though I am not hereby justified;) but He that judgeth me is the Lord.

5. Wherefore judge nothing before the time; even until the Lord come, who will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every one have praise from God.

6. These things, my brethren, I have by a figure transferred to myself, and Apollos, for your sakes, that ye may learn in us not to be wise above what is written, that ye may not be puffed up for one against another.

7. For who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou, which thou didst not receive? And if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?

8. Ye are now full, ye are now rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I wish ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.

9. For it seems to me that God hath as it were exhibited us the apostles last upon the stage as appointed to death; for we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels and to men.

10. We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ: we are weak, but ye are strong: ye are honoured, but we are despised.

11. Even to this present time we suffer both hunger, and thirst, and nakedness, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling:

12. and we labour working with our own hands. When we are reviled, we bless: when persecuted, we bear it: when defamed, we intreat.

13. We are made as the filth of the world, and the refuse of all things to this day.

14. I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I admonish you:

15. for if ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet ye have not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you by the gospel.

16. I beseech you therefore, be ye imitators of me.

17. For this end have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved son and faithful in the Lord, who will bring to your remembrance my ways in Christ, how I teach every where in every church.

18. Now some are puffed up, as if I would not come to you.

19. But I will come to you soon, if the Lord please, and will know, not the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power:

20. for the kingdom of God consisteth not in speech, but in power.

21. What do ye chuse? that I should come to you with a rod? or in love, and in the spirit of meekness? 

## 1 Corinthians 5

1. It is commonly reported that there is lewdness among you, and such lewdness as is not named even amongst the heathens, that one should have his father's wife.

2. And are ye puffed up, and have not rather grieved? that he who hath committed this fact might be expelled from among you?

3. For I indeed, absent in body, but present in spirit, have already, as if I were present, judged him who hath wrought this wickedness: in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

4. when ye are assembled together with my spirit, by the power, I say,

5. of our Lord Jesus Christ, to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. Your boasting is not good.

6. Do ye not know that a little leaven leaveneth the whole mass?

7. Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new mass, without leaven. For our paschal lamb, even Christ, was slain for us.

8. Wherefore let us keep the feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavening of sincerity and truth.

9. I wrote to you in an epistle, not to associate with whoremongers:

10. but I did not mean not at all with the whoremongers of this world, or the covetous, or rapacious, or idolaters: since ye must then go out of the world.

11. But now I have written to you, not to associate with him, if any one, that is called a brother, be a whoremonger, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or rapacious; with such a one no not to eat.

12. For what have I to do to judge those that are without? and do not ye judge those that are within?

13. But those who are without, God judgeth: and therefore put away the wicked one from among you. 

## 1 Corinthians 6

1. Dare any of you, having a matter of complaint against another, try it before the unjust, and not before the saints?

2. Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy of judging the smallest controversies?

3. Know ye not that we shall judge angels? what! and not worthy of judging the affairs of this life?

4. Therefore if ye have controversies about the things of this life, do ye set them to judge, who are despised by the church?

5. I speak it to your shame. What! is there not one wise man among you, that is able to judge between his bretheren?

6. But one brother goeth to law with another, and this before infidels.

7. Now there is certainly a fault among you, that ye have law-suits with one another: why do ye not rather endure wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?

8. But ye do wrong and defraud, and that even your brethren.

9. What! know ye not that the unjust shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor the effeminate, nor sodomites, nor thieves,

10. nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor rapacious persons, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

11. And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the spirit of our God.

12. All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be under the power of any:

13. meats are for the belly, and the belly for meats, but God will destroy both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.

14. And as God hath raised up the Lord, so will He raise up us by his power.

15. Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them members of an harlot?

16. God forbid! What! know ye not that he who is joined to an harlot is one body with her? for these two, saith he, shall be one flesh.

17. And he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.

18. Flee from whoredom. Every other sin, that a man committeth, is without the body; but he, that committeth whoredom, sinneth against his own body.

19. What! know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have from God?

20. and ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price. Glorify God therefore in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's. 

## 1 Corinthians 7

1. Now as to the things concerning which ye wrote to me: it were good for a man not to touch a woman.

2. Nevertheless to prevent whoredoms, let every one have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.

3. Let the husband render to the wife due benevolence; and in like manner also the wife to the husband.

4. The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband; and in like manner also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.

5. Do not withdraw from one another, unless by consent for a season, that ye may attend to fasting and prayer: and come together again, least Satan tempt you through your incontinency.

6. But I say this by way of permission, not of command:

7. for I could wish that all men were as I myself am; but every man hath his proper gift from God, one of one kind and another of another?

8. Now to the unmarried and widows I say, it is good for them to continue so, as I do.

9. But if they have not the gift of continence, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn with lust.

10. But those that are married, not I command, but the Lord, that the wife be not separated from her husband;

11. (but if she separate, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband;) and that the husband put not away his wife.

12. But to the rest say I, not the Lord, If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she like to dwell with him, let him not put her away.

13. And if any wife hath an unbelieving husband, and he like to dwell with her, let her not leave him.

14. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband: else were your children unclean; but they are holy.

15. But if the unbeliever depart, let them depart; a brother or a sister is not bound in such cases.

16. But God hath called us to peace; for how knowest thou, O wife, but thou shalt save thy husband; or how knowest thou, O husband, but thou shalt save thy wife?

17. However, as God hath distributed to every man, and as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk: and thus I order in all the churches.

18. Is any one called that is circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised: is any one called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised: for circumcision is nothing,

19. and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God.

20. In the calling in which every one was called, let him continue.

21. Wast thou called being a slave, be not anxious about it; but if thou canst be made free, prefer it.

22. For he that is called in the Lord being a slave, is the Lord's freed-man: and he likewise that is called being free is the servant of Christ.

23. Ye are bought with a price, do not become the slaves of men.

24. Brethren, in whatever condition every one was when called, let him abide therein with God.

25. But concerning single persons I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgement as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.

26. I think then, that it is---better on account of the present distress,---that it is better, I say,

27. for a single man to be so. Art thou bound to a wife indeed? seek not to be loosed: but art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.

28. Though, if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned: such however will probably have more trouble in life: but I spare you.

29. But this I say, brethren, that the time is short: it remains therefore, that even those, who have wives, be as though they had none;

30. and they, that weep, as if they wept not; and they, that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not; and they, that buy, as if they possessed not;

31. and they, that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.

32. And I would have you without anxiety. Now he, that is unmarried, careth for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord; but he,

33. that is married, is in care about the things of the world, and how he may please his wife.

34. There is a difference also between a wife and a virgin: she, that is unmarried, careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but she, that is married, is in care about the things of the world, and how she may please her husband.

35. And this I say for your own benefit, not that I may cast a snare upon you, but in order to recommend that which is fit and becoming before the Lord without distraction.

36. But if any one think that he acts unbecomingly towards his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and that it ought to be so, let him do what he will; he doth not sin: let them marry.

37. But he, that is stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath determined in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doth well.

38. So that he, who giveth her in marriage, doth well; but he, that giveth her not in marriage, doth better.

39. The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth: but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will, only in the Lord:

40. but she is happier, in my opinion, if she continue as she is: and I think I have the Spirit of God. 

## 1 Corinthians 8

1. Now as to things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge about them. Knowledge however puffeth up, but charity edifieth.

2. And if any one be conceited of his knowledge, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.

3. But if any man love God, he is owned by Him.

4. As to the eating therefore of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one.

5. For though there be some that are called Gods, whether in heaven or on earth, (as there are among the heathen gods many,

6. and lords many,) yet to us there is but one God the Father, from whom are all things, and we in Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by Him.

7. But there is not in all men this knowledge: and some with a consciousness of the idol unto this day, eat it as a thing sacrificed to an idol, and so their conscience being weak is defiled.

8. But meat does not recommend us to God; for neither, if we eat, are we the better; nor the worse, if we eat not.

9. But see that this liberty of yours be not by any means a stumbling-block to the weak.

10. For if any one see thee, who hast knowledge, at table in an idol's temple, will not the conscience of him that is weak be encouraged to eat of the things sacrificed to idols?

11. and so the weak brother, for whom Christ died, shall perish by thy knowledge?

12. But in thus sinning against your brethren, and wounding their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ:

13. wherefore if meat make my brother to offend, I will never eat flesh while I breathe, least I make my brother to offend. 

## 1 Corinthians 9

1. Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? and are not ye my work in the Lord?

2. If I am not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you: for ye are in the Lord the seal of my apostleship.

3. And this is my answer to them that call me to account: have we not power to eat and to drink?

4. have

5. we not power to lead about with us a sister a wife as well as other apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?

6. Or is it I only and Barnabas, that have not power to forbear working?

7. Who ever goes a warfare at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and doth not eat of the fruit of it? or who feedeth a flock, and doth not eat of the milk of the flock?

8. Do I speak these things as a man only?

9. or saith not the law the same also? for it is written in the law of Moses, "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn." Now doth God take care for oxen,

10. or doth He say this indeed for our sakes? For it is certainly written for our sakes, that he, who ploweth, might plow in hope; and that he, who thresheth in hope, should partake of his hope.

11. If we then have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we reap your carnal things?

12. If others partake of this power over you, may not we rather? though we have not used this power; but we bear all things, least we should cause any hindrance to the gospel of Christ.

13. Do ye not know, that they who are employed about the sacrifices have their food from the temple? and they, who attend at the altar, are partakers with the altar?

14. So also the Lord hath ordained, that those who preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel.

15. But I have availed myself of none of these things. Nor have I written these things, that it might be so done as to me: for it were better for me to die, than that any one should make this my glorying void.

16. For if I preach the gospel, yet I have no ground for boasting; because I am under necessity to do it: and wo is me if I do not preach the Gospel.

17. Now if I do this willingly, I have a reward; and if unwillingly, yet I am intrusted with the commission, and I must execute it.

18. What is my reward then but this? that when I preach I may make the gospel of Christ not expensive, that so I may not abuse my power in the gospel.

19. For though I am free from all, yet I have made myself a servant to all, that I might gain the more.

20. And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; that is, to those, who are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law:

21. and to those without the law as without the law, (not being without law to God, but under the law to Christ) that I might gain those who are without the law.

22. To the weak I became as the weak, that I might gain the weak: I became all things to all men, that I might by every means save some.

23. And this I do for the sake of the gospel, that I may be a fellow partaker of it.

24. Know ye not, that those, who run in a race, do all indeed run, but one only receiveth the prize? So run that ye may obtain.

25. And every one that enters the lists is temperate in all things: they indeed do it that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible one.

26. I therefore so run, not as unobserved: I so fight, not as one that beateth the air:

27. but I mortify my body and bring it into subjection, least after having preached to others, I myself should be rejected. 

## 1 Corinthians 10

1. Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;

2. and were all baptized into Moses by the cloud and by the sea;

3. and did all eat the same spiritual food;

4. and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them: and that rock was an emblem of Christ.

5. But with the greater part of them God was displeased: for they were destroyed in the wilderness.

6. Now these things were examples for us, that we might not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.

7. And be ye not idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written, "The people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play."

8. Neither let us commit whoredom, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.

9. Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted Him, and were destroyed by serpents: nor murmur,

10. as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer.

11. Now all these things happened to them as examples: and are written for our admonition, on whom the last ages are come.

12. Wherefore let him, that thinks he standeth, take heed least he fall.

13. No temptation has yet taken you but what is common to man: and God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able to sustain; but will with the temptation also make a way of escape, that ye may be able to bear it.

14. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, flee from idolatry.

15. I speak to you as to men of understanding: and judge ye what I say,

16. ---The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? the bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?

17. For the bread is one, and we though many are one body; for we all partake of that one bread.

18. Consider Israel according to the flesh, Are not they, that eat of the sacrifices, partakers of the altar?

19. What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that what is sacrificed to an idol is in itself any thing to stumble at?

20. No: but this I say, that what the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God.

21. And I would not have you partakers with demons. Ye cannot drink of the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.

22. Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than He?

23. If all things be lawful for me, yet all things are not expedient: all things may be lawful for me, but all things do not edify.

24. Let no one seek his own only, but every one another's benefit.

25. Eat then whatever is sold in the shambles, asking no questions for conscience sake:

26. for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:

27. and if any of the unbelievers invite you to an entertainment, and ye have a mind to go, whatever is set before you, eat, asking no questions for conscience-sake.

28. But if any one say to you, This hath been sacrificed to an idol,---eat it not; for his sake who informed thee, and for conscience-sake: for, as I said, the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof, so that thou mayst have food enough without it.

29. Conscience I say, not thy own, but the other's; for why is my liberty to be judged by another man's conscience?

30. And if I partake with thankfulness, why am I blamed for that, for which I give thanks?

31. Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.

32. Behave inoffensively both to the Jews, and to the Greeks, and to the church of God.

33. Even as I also endeavour to please all men in all things, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved. 

## 1 Corinthians 11

1. Be ye then imitators of me, as I also am of Christ.

2. Now I commend you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.

3. But I would have you know that Christ is the head of every man; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.

4. Every man praying or prophesying, having a veil on his head, dishonoureth Him who is his head.

5. But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoureth man her head; for it is even all one as if she were shaved.

6. For if a woman be not covered, she may as well be shorn: but if it be shameful to a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered.

7. For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, he being the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.

8. For the man was not of the woman; but the woman was taken out of the man:

9. nor was the man created for the sake of the woman, but the woman for the man.

10. For this reason ought the woman to have power on her head, because of the angels.

11. Nevertheless, neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.

12. For as the woman was originally from the man, so also is the man by the woman: but all things are from God.

13. Judge in yourselves, Is it decent for a woman to pray to God uncovered?

14. Doth not even nature itself teach you, that if a man have long hair, it is a disgrace to him?

15. but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her; because the hair was given her as for a veil.

16. But if any one is pleased to contend for the contrary, I answer, We have no such custom, nor any of the churches of God.

17. But whilst I am declaring this, I do not commend you, that ye assemble together not for the better, but for the worse.

18. For first when ye come together in the church, I hear there are divisions among you, and I partly believe it.

19. For there must be even heresies among you, that they who are approved may be made manifest among you.

20. When therefore ye thus assemble together, this is not eating the Lord's supper:

21. for in eating every one takes his own supper first; and one is hungry, and another is glutted.

22. What! have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or do ye despise the church of God, and shame those that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.

23. For I received from the Lord, that which I also delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which He was betrayed took bread:

24. and gave thanks, and brake it, and said, "Take and eat; this is my body, which is going to be broken for you: this do in remembrance of me."

25. And in the same manner He took the cup, after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant ratified in my blood: this do, as often as ye drink of it, in remembrance of me."

26. As often then as ye eat of this bread, and drink of this cup, ye commemorate the Lord's death till he come.

27. So that whosoever eateth this bread, or drinketh of the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord.

28. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of this bread and drink of this cup:

29. for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgement against himself, not distinguishing the Lord's body.

30. For this many among you are weak and infirm, and several are fallen asleep.

31. If then we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged:

32. but when judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.

33. Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait for one another:

34. and if any one be hungry, let him eat at home, that ye may not come together to your condemnation. And as to other things, I will set them in order when I come. 

## 1 Corinthians 12

1. Now concerning spiritual gifts, my brethren, I would not have you ignorant.

2. Ye know that ye were Gentiles, drawn aside after dumb idols, just as ye were led: wherefore,

3. I must acquaint you, that no one speaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Jesus a curse: and no one can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghost.

4. Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit: and there are different offices, but the same Lord:

5. and there are diversities of operations,

6. but it is the same God who worketh them all in every one.

7. But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the advantage of all.

8. For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;

9. to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;

10. to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another the discerning of spirits; to another various kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:

11. but all these worketh that one and the same Spirit distributing to every one in particular as He sees fit.

12. For as the body is one, and hath many members; but all the parts of this one body, though many, are but one body:

13. so also is the mystical body of Christ; for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, (whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free) and are all made to drink into one Spirit:

14. for the body is not one member, but many.

15. If the foot should say, "Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body," is it therefore not of the body?

16. And if the ear should say, "Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body," is it therefore not of the body?

17. If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? and if the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?

18. But now God hath placed the members, every one of them in the body, as He pleased.

19. And if they were all one member, where were the body?

20. whereas now there are many members, yet but one body.

21. And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.

22. But those parts of the body, which seem to be weaker, are much more necessary:

23. and those which we judge the less honorable parts we clothe with more abundant honor; and so our less comely parts have more comeliness added to them, of which our comely ones have no need.

24. But God hath so blended the several parts of the body, giving greater honor to that which was deficient,

25. that there might be no schism in the body; but that all the members might have the same care one for another.

26. And so if one member suffer all the members suffer with it; and if one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.

27. Now ye are the body of Christ, and his members each of you in particular.

28. And God hath placed you accordingly in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miraculous powers, then gifts of healing, helps, governments, and various kinds of tongues.

29. Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers?

30. have all miraculous powers? have all the gifts of healing? do all speak many languages? do all interpret? but ye are all zealous for the best gifts.

31. Though I will shew you a way yet more excellent. 

## 1 Corinthians 13

1. For if I speak with the tongues of men and angels, and have not charity, I am but as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

2. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and am acquainted with all mysteries, and all knowledge: yea if I have faith, even. to remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.

3. And though I give all my substance to feed the poor, and my body to be burnt, and have not charity, I am nothing profited.

4. Charity beareth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity is not insolent, is not puffed up,

5. doth not behave indecently, is not selfish, is not easily provoked,

6. suspecteth no evil, rejoiceth not at injustice, but rejoiceth in the truth:

7. covereth all faults, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.

8. Charity never faileth: but as to prophecies, they shall be abolished; or tongues, they shall cease; or knowledge, it shall be laid aside.

9. For now we know but in part, and we prophesy but in part.

10. But when that which is perfect shall come, then that which is defective shall be laid aside.

11. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned as a child: but when I became a man, I laid aside childish things.

12. For we see now as through a mirror obscurely: but then we shall see face to face. Now I know but in part, but then I shall know even as I am known.

13. And now abideth faith, hope, love, these three graces; but the greatest of these is love. 

## 1 Corinthians 14

1. Labour after charity, and be desirous of spiritual gifts: but especially that ye may prophesy.

2. For he, that speaketh in an unknown tongue, speaketh not to men, but to God: for no one understandeth, though in spirit he speaketh mysteries.

3. But he, that prophesieth, speaketh edification, and exhortation, and comfort to men.

4. He, that speaketh in an unknown tongue, edifieth himself: but he, that prophesieth, edifieth the church.

5. I could wish that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edification.

6. Now, my brethren, if I come to you speaking with many tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak intelligibly to you of revelation, or knowledge, or prophecy, or doctrine?

7. As inanimate things which give a found, whether pipe or harp, unless they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall what is piped or harped be understood?

8. For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for the battle?

9. So also unless ye utter by the tongue intelligible words, how shall what is spoken be understood? for thus ye will be only talking to the wind.

10. There are, it may be, as many kinds of voices in the world as people, and none of them insignificant.

11. But if I know not the force of the words, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian to me.

12. So ye also, since ye are so desirous of spiritual gifts, seek to abound in them to the edification of the church.

13. Wherefore let him, that speaketh in an unknown tongue, pray that he may interpret.

14. For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit indeed prayeth, but my meaning is fruitless.

15. What is then to be done? I will pray with the Spirit, but I will pray to be understood: I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing to be understood.

16. For if thou bless in the spirit, how shall the unlearned say Amen to thy thanksgiving, when he knoweth not what thou sayst?

17. thou indeed givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.

18. I thank God, I speak with tongues more than you all.

19. But in a public assembly I had rather speak five words to be understood, that I may instruct others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.

20. My brethren, be not children in sense: but in malice be infants, and in your judgements shew yourselves to be men.

21. It is written in the law, "By men of another language, and by other lips, will I speak to this people, and even so they will not listen to me, saith the Lord."

22. So that tongues are for a sign, not to believers but to unbelievers: but prophecy not to unbelievers but to those that believe.

23. If then the whole church be come together and all speak in unknown tongues, and there come in illiterate persons, or infidels, will they not say that ye are mad?

24. But if all prophesy, and there come in an unbeliever, or one unlearned, he is convinced by all, he is judged by all.

25. And thus the secrets of his heart are made manifest; so that falling down upon his face he will worship God, declaring that God is indeed among you.

26. What is then to be done, my brethren? when ye come together, if any of you hath a psalm, a doctrine, a tongue, a revelation, an interpretation,---let all be done for edification.

27. And if any one speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at most by three, and that by turns; and let one interpret.

28. But if there be no interpreter, let him be silent in the assembly; and let him speak to himself and to God.

29. And let but two or three of the prophets speak, and the others judge.

30. And if any thing be revealed to another sitting by, let the first have done speaking before the other begins.

31. For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.

32. And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets:

33. for God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as we see in all the assemblies of the saints.

34. Let your women be silent in your assemblies: for it is not permitted to them to speak, but they are to be in subjection, as the law saith.

35. And if they would learn any thing, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it does not become women to speak in a public assembly.

36. Did the word of God come out first from you? or did it come to you only?

37. If any one seem to be a prophet, or acted by the Spirit, let him acknowlege that what I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.

38. But if any will be ignorant, let him be ignorant.

39. Wherefore, my brethren, be most desirous to prophesy, and yet forbid not to speak with tongues:

40. but let all things be done decently and in order. 

## 1 Corinthians 15

1. Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached to you at first, which ye received, and wherein ye stand.

2. By which also ye are saved, if ye retain it as I preached it to you: unless indeed ye have believed in vain.

3. For in the first place I delivered to you, that which I also received, to wit, that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures:

4. and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day, according to the scriptures.

5. And that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve:

6. after that He appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain yet alive, but some are fallen asleep.

7. Afterwards He was seen by James, then by all the apostles.

8. And last of all He appeared to me also, as one born out of due time: for I am the lest of the apostles,

9. not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

10. But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his favor to me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.

11. Whether therefore I or they laboured most, thus we preach, and thus ye believed.

12. Now if it be preached that Christ is risen from the dead, how say some among you, that there is no resurrection of the dead?

13. for if there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen.

14. And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.

15. Yea, and we are found false witnesses concerning God, for we have testified of God, that He raised up Christ; whom He did not raise up, if indeed the dead do not rise.

16. For if the dead rise not, then Christ is not raised:

17. and if Christ be not risen, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.

18. Then they also that sleep in Christ, are perished.

19. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.

20. But now Christ is risen from the dead, and is become the first-fruits of them that slept:

21. for as by man came death, by man cometh also the resurrection of the dead.

22. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.

23. But each in their proper order: the first-fruits, Christ; afterwards they that are Christ's, at his coming.

24. Then will be the end, when He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the Father; when He shall have abolished all rule, and all authority, and power.

25. For he must reign till He hath put all his enemies under his feet.

26. The last enemy that is destroyed is death:

27. for He hath put all things under his feet. But when He saith that all things are put under Him, it is plain that we are to except Him who put all things under Him.

28. And when all things shall be subjected to Him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to Him, that put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.

29. Besides, what shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why then are they baptized for the dead?

30. And why are we in danger every hour?

31. I protest by your rejoicing, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, that I am even dying daily.

32. If, to speak as a man, I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantage have I, if the dead rise not? Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die. ---

33. Be not deceived, bad conversations corrupt good morals.

34. Behave soberly, as ye ought to do, and sin not: for some of you have not the knowledge of God; to your shame I speak it.

35. But some will say, How are the dead raised, and with what body do they come?

36. Silly creature! that which thou sowest, is not quickened, except it die first.

37. And as to what thou sowest, thou sowest not the very body that shall be produced, but a bare grain, it may be, of wheat, or any other corn:

38. and God giveth it a body as He pleaseth, and to every one of the seeds it's own body.

39. All flesh is not the same kind of flesh: but there is one flesh of men, and another of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.

40. There are also celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies: but there is one glory of the celestial, and another of the terrestrial.

41. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: and one star differeth from another star in glory.

42. So also will be the resurrection of the dead. Our body is sown in corruption, it is raised incorruptible: it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory:

43. it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;

44. it is sown an animal body, it is raised a spiritual body: for there is an animal body, and there is a spiritual body.

45. And so it is written, "The first man Adam was made a living soul." But the last Adam is an enlivening spirit.

46. However, the spiritual is not first, but the animal; and afterwards the spiritual.

47. The first man being made out of the earth, was earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.

48. Such as the earthy was, such are they also that are earthy: and such, as is the heavenly, are they also that are heavenly.

49. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.

50. But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor doth what is corruptible inherit incorruption.

51. Behold, I tell you a mystery: we shall not all sleep; but we shall all be changed in a moment,

52. in the twinkling of an eye, at the sound of the last trumpet (for the trumpet shall sound) and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed:

53. for this corruptible body must put on incorruption, and this mortal body must be clothed with immortality.

54. And when this corruptible shall be clothed with incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the word that is written, "Death is swallowed up in victory."

55. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?

56. the sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law:

57. but thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

58. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, since ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. 

## 1 Corinthians 16

1. Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.

2. Upon the first day of the week let every one of you set apart something, putting it into the treasury, according as he is prospered: that there may be no need of collections, when I come.

3. And when I am with you, whomsoever ye shall approve, I will send, with your letters, to carry your bounty to Jerusalem.

4. And if it be requisite for me to go also, they shall go with me.

5. I will come to you, when I have passed through Macedonia; for I am to pass through Macedonia.

6. And perhaps I shall stay a while, or even pass the winter with you; that ye may forward me on my journey, whithersoever I go.

7. For I do not intend to see you now in my way, as I hope to stay some time with you, if the Lord permit.

8. But I shall stay at Ephesus till Pentecost. For a great and effectual door is opened to me,

9. though there are many opposers.

10. If Timothy should come, see that he be with you without fear: for he is employed in the work of the Lord, as I also am.

11. Let no one therefore despise him: but forward him on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brethren. As to our brother Apollos,

12. I much importuned him to come to you with the brethren: but he was not at all willing to come now; though he will come when he has a favorable opportunity.

13. Be watchful, stand fast in the faith, behave like men, be strong:

14. and let all your affairs be carried on in love.

15. I beseech you, brethren, (for ye know the family of Stephanas, that they are the first-fruits of Achaia, and

16. have set themselves to minister to the saints) that you also would be subservient to such, and to every one that worketh and laboureth with us.

17. I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus: for what was wanting in you, they have made up.

18. For they have refreshed my spirit as well as yours: have a due regard therefore to such worthy persons.

19. The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla, with the church in their house, salute you in the Lord with much affection:

20. yea all the brethren salute you. Salute one another with an holy kiss.

21. The salutation of me Paul I write with my own hand.

22. If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be made a curse.

23. Maran-atha. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

24. My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
