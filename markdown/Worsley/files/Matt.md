# Matthew

## Matthew 1

1. The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.

2. Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren;

3. and Judah had Phares and Zara by Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom,

4. and Esrom begat Aram, and Aram begat Aminadab, and Aminadab begat Naasson, and Naasson begat Salmon,

5. and Salmon had Booz by Rahab, and Booz had Obed by Ruth,

6. and Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David the king, and David had Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah.

7. And Solomon begat Roboam, and Roboam begat Abia,

8. and Abia begat Asa, and Asa begat Josaphat, and Josaphat begat Joram,

9. and Joram begat Ozias, and Ozias begat Joatham, and Joatham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Ezechias,

10. and Ezechias begat Manasses, and Manasses begat Amon,

11. and Amon begat Josias, and Josias begat Jakim, and Jakim begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time of their being carried away to Babylon.

12. And after the captivity of Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel,

13. and Salathiel begat Zorobabel, and Zorobabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor,

14. and Azor begat Sadok, and Sadok begat Achim,

15. and Achim begat Eliud, and Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob,

16. and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ.

17. All the generations therefore from Abraham to David are fourteen generations: and from David until the captivity of Babylon fourteen generations: and from the Babylonish captivity unto Christ, fourteen generations.

18. Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in wise: when Mary his mother was promised in marriage to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child by the Holy Ghost:

19. but Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing publicly to expose her, was inclined to break off the contract with her privately;

20. and when he was thinking on these things, behold an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph thou Son of David, scruple not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.

21. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.

22. (Now all this came to pass, that it might be fulfilled, which the Lord spake by the prophet, saying,

23. "Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel," which is God with us.)

24. So Joseph, when he awoke from his sleep, did as the angel of the Lord directed him, and took home his wife:

25. and he knew her not, till she brought forth her Son the first-born, and he called his name Jesus. 

## Matthew 2

1. Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of king Herod, behold, there came certain wise men from the east to Jerusalem,

2. saying, Where is the king of the Jews that is born here? for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship Him.

3. And when Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him:

4. and having summoned together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he enquired of them where the Messiah was to be born: and they told him, at Bethlehem in Judea;

5. for thus it is written by the prophet,

6. "And thou Bethlehem in the land of Juda art not the meanest among the cities of the princes of Juda; for out of thee shall come forth a ruler, that shall feed my people Israel."

7. Then Herod called the wise men to him privately, and inquired of them exactly the time of the star's appearing:

8. and sending them to Bethlehem, he said, Go and make diligent search for the child, and when ye have found Him, let me know, that I also may come and worship Him.

9. When they had heard the king, they went: and lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went on before them, till it came and stood over the place where the child was.

10. And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy;

11. and coming into the house, they found the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshipped Him: and when they had opened their treasures, they brought Him presents, of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

12. And being warned of God in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back into their own country another way.

13. And when they were departed, behold an angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Rise and take the child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and continue there, untill I tell thee to return: for Herod will seek the child to destroy Him.

14. And he arose and took the child and his mother by night, and went away into Egypt:

15. and stayed there till the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which the Lord spake by the prophet, saying, " Out of Egypt have I called my Son."

16. Then Herod, when he saw that he was baffled by the wise-men, was very much enraged; and he sent and slew all the male-children in Bethlehem, and in all its borders, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had exactly inquired of the wise-men.

17. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet,

18. saying, In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel bewailing her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.

19. But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,

20. saying, Arise and take the child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they, that sought the child's life, are dead.

21. And he arose, and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel:

22. but when he heard that Archelaus reigned over Judea in the room of Herod his father, he was afraid to go thither; however being warned of God in a dream, he retired into the district of Galilee.

23. And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene. 

## Matthew 3

1. Now in those days came John the baptist preaching in the desert part of Judea,

2. and saying, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand:

3. for this is He who was spoken of by Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the desert, "Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."

4. And this John had his clothes of camels hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey.

5. Then went, out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the country about Jordan,

6. and they were baptized by him in Jordan, confessing their sins.

7. But when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees coming to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

8. Bring forth therefore fruits becoming: penitents: and do not say within your selves,

9. "We have Abraham for our father:" for I tell you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.

10. And now the ax is laid to the root of the trees; every tree therefore, which yieldeth not good fruit, is cut down and cast into the fire.

11. I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but He that cometh after me, is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry: He shall baptize you with the holy Spirit and with fire.

12. Whose fan is in his hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and gather the wheat into his granary, but will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.

13. Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized by him: but John refused Him, saying,

14. I have need to be baptized by thee, and comest thou to me?

15. And Jesus answering said unto him, Permit it now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.

16. Then he permitted Him. And Jesus as soon as He was baptized came up from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened unto Him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and coming upon Him:

17. and lo, a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. 

## Matthew 4

1. Then was Jesus led by the spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the devil:

2. and when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, at last He was very hungry.

3. And the tempter came to Him and said, If thou art the Son of God, command these stones to become bread:

4. but He answered and said, It is written, "Man shall not live upon bread only, but on whatever proceedeth from the mouth of God."

5. Then the devil taketh Him into the holy city, and setteth Him on a wing of the temple,

6. and saith unto Him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down; for it is written, He will give his angels charge concerning thee, and they shall bear thee up as in their hands, least at any time thou shouldst dash thy foot against a stone:

7. but Jesus said unto him, it is also written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.

8. Again the devil taketh Him to a very high mountain, and sheweth Him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;

9. and saith unto Him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me:

10. then Jesus saith unto him, Be gone, Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,

11. and Him only shalt thou serve. Then the devil left Him, and behold angels came and attended Him.

12. Now when Jesus heard that John was imprisoned, He departed into Galilee:

13. and leaving Nazareth He came and dwelt in Capernaum a maritime town, on the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:

14. that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, "The land of Zabulon,

15. and Nephthalim, by the way of the sea,

16. about Jordan, Galilee of the gentiles, the people that sat in darkness, saw a great light, and to them, who sat in the region and shadow of death, light is sprung up."

17. From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

18. Now as Jesus was walking by the sea of Galilee, He saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; (for they were fishermen:)

19. and He saith unto them, Come with me, and I will make you fishers of men:

20. and they immediately left their nets, and followed Him.

21. And going on from thence He saw two other brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets;

22. and He called them also; and they immediately left the ship, and their father, and followed Him.

23. And Jesus went through all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom of heaven, and healing every disease and every malady among the people.

24. And his fame spread abroad into all Syria; and they brought unto Him all their sick, that laboured under various diseases and torments; even those who were possessed with devils, and lunatics, and paralytics; and he healed them:

25. and great multitudes of people followed Him from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, yea and from beyond Jordan. 

## Matthew 5

1. And seeing the multitudes He went up to a mountain, and when He was set down, His disciples came to Him,

2. and He opened his mouth and taught them, saying,

3. Blessed are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

4. Blessed are they that mourn; for they shall be comforted.

5. Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit the earth.

6. Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness; for they shall be satisfied.

7. Blessed are the merciful; for they shall obtain mercy.

8. Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.

9. Blessed are the peace-makers; for they shall be called the children of God.

10. Blessed are they, who are persecuted for righteousness sake; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

11. Blessed are ye when men shall revile and persecute you, and utter all manner of reproach against you falsly, for my sake:

12. rejoice and be exceeding glad; for great will be your reward in heaven: for so they persecuted the prophets, that were before you.

13. Ye are the salt of the earth, but if the salt be grown insipid, wherewith shall it be seasoned? it is no longer fit for any thing, but to be thrown out of doors, and trodden under foot.

14. Ye are the light of the world: a city, that is situated on a hill, cannot be hid.

15. Nor do men light a candle, to put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick: and then it giveth light to all in the house.

16. So let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your father, who is in heaven.

17. Think not that I am come to abrogate the law, or the prophets: I am not come to abolish, but to compleat them:

18. for verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, not one jot nor one tittle shall pass from the law, till all be compleated.

19. Whosoever therefore shall break one of the left of these commandments, and thereby teach men so to do, he shall be esteemed very little in the kingdom of heaven: but whoever shall do as well as teach them, he shall be accounted great in the kingdom of heaven.

20. For I tell you, that unless your righteousness exceed that of the scribes and pharisees, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.

21. Ye have heard, that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever committeth murder, shall be liable to the judgment:

22. but I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother without cause shall be liable to the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be obnoxious to the council; but whosoever shall say, "Thou fool," shall be in danger of hell-fire.

23. Therefore, if thou bring thine offering to the altar, and there remembrest that thy brother hath any complaint against thee;

24. leave thy gift there before the altar, and go and first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.

25. Be friends with thine adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him; least the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison:

26. verily, I say unto thee, thou shalt not come out from thence, till thou hast paid the very last farthing.

27. Ye have heard, that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not commit adultery:

28. but I tell you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, so as to lust after her, hath already debauched her in his heart.

29. And therefore if thy right eye cause thee to offend, pluck it out and cast it from thee; for it is better for thee that one part of thee perish, than that thy whole body should be cast into hell:

30. and if thy right hand cause thee to offend, cut it off and cast it from thee; for it is better for thee that one of thy limbs should perish, than that thy whole body should be cast into hell.

31. And it has been said, whosoever would put away his wife, let him give her a bill of divorce:

32. but I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, except on account of whoredom, tempteth her to commit adultery; and if any man marry her that is divorced, he committeth adultery.

33. Again, ye have heard, that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:

34. but I say unto you, swear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;

35. nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King: neither shalt thou swear by thy head,

36. for thou canst not make one hair of it white or black:

37. but let your conversation be yea, yea; no, no; for whatever is more than these, cometh from the evil one.

38. Ye have heard, that it has been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:

39. but I say unto you, Set not yourselves against him that injures you, but if any one smite thee on thy right cheek, rather turn to him the other also:

40. and if any one would go to law with thee, to take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also, rather than strive with him:

41. and if any one shall force thee one mile, go with him two.

42. Give to him that asketh thee, and him, that would borrow of thee, turn not away.

43. Ye have heard, that it has been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy:

44. but I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that abuse you and persecute you;

45. that ye may be the children of your heavenly Father; for He causeth his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain upon the just and the unjust.

46. For if ye love only them that love you, what reward do ye expect? do not even the publicans the same?

47. and if ye embrace your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not the publicans so likewise?

48. Be ye therefore perfect in love and goodness, as your Father who is in heaven is perfect. 

## Matthew 6

1. Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be observed by them: otherwise ye will have no reward from your Father, who is in heaven.

2. Therefore when thou dost an alms-deed, do not proclaim it abroad, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues, and in the streets, that they may be applauded by men. Verily I tell you, they have their reward.

3. But when thou givest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth:

4. that thine alms may be in secret, and thy Father, who seeth in secret, will himself reward thee openly.

5. And when thou prayest, be not like the hypocrites; for they love to pray in public assemblies, and in the corners of the streets, that they may be taken notice of by men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.

6. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret, will reward thee openly.

7. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathens do, for they think they shall be heard for their speaking much:

8. be not ye therefore like them; for your Father knoweth what ye have need of before ye ask Him.

9. After this manner therefore pray ye,

10. "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done, as in heaven so also upon earth;

11. give us this day our daily bread;

12. and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors;

13. and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one: for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory for ever. Amen."

14. For if ye forgive men their faults, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:

15. but if ye forgive not men their transgressions, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

16. And when ye fast, be not, like the hypocrites, of a gloomy countenance; for they disfigure their faces, that they may be observed by men to fast: I tell you, they have indeed their reward.

17. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head and wash thy face;

18. that thou mayst not appear unto men to fast, but to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, will reward thee openly.

19. Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust corrupts, and where thieves break through and steal:

20. but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:

21. for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

22. The eye is the light of the body: if therefore thine eye be clear, thy whole body will be light;

23. but if thine eye be bad, thy whole body will be dark. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!

24. No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or at lest he will be attached to the one, and neglect the other: ye cannot serve God and mammon:

25. therefore I say unto you, be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body than raiment?

26. Look at the birds of the air; they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns: and yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye preferable to them?

27. And which of you by all his thought can add one cubit to his stature?

28. And why are ye sollicitous about raiment? consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I tell you,

29. that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

30. Now if God so clothe the grass of the field, which is growing to-day, and to-morrow is cast into the fire, will He not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?

31. Be not therefore anxious, saying, What shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or how shall we be clothed?

32. (things which the heathens are so inquisitive after) for your heavenly Father knows that ye have need of all these.

33. But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these shall be superadded unto you.

34. Be not therefore sollicitous about the morrow; for the morrow will require thought for its own affairs: sufficient to each day is its own trouble. 

## Matthew 7

1. Judge not, that ye be not judged:

2. for with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured back again to you.

3. And why dost thou look at the splinter in thy brother's eye, but takest no notice of the beam in thine own eye?

4. Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me take the chaff out of thine eye, and behold, there is a beam in thine own eye?

5. Thou hypocrite, first get the beam out of thine own eye; and then thou wilt see how to take the splinter out of thy brother's eye.

6. Give not that which is holy unto dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine; least they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you.

7. Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:

8. for every one, that asketh, receiveth; and he, that seeketh, findeth; and to him, that knocketh, it shall be opened.

9. Is there any man among you, who, if his son ask him for bread, will give him a stone?

10. or if he ask for a fish, will he give him a serpent?

11. If ye then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good things to them that ask Him?

12. All things therefore whatsoever ye would have men do to you, do ye also in like manner unto them: for this is the doctrine of the law and the prophets.

13. Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be who go in thereat:

14. whereas the gate is narrow, and the way troublesome, which leadeth into life, and few there be that find it.

15. And beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheeps clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.

16. Ye will know them by their fruits: do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?

17. so every good tree yieldeth good fruit, but a corrupt tree produces bad fruit:

18. a good tree cannot produce evil fruit, nor can a corrupt tree bear good fruit:

19. and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.

20. So then by their fruits ye will know them.

21. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doth the will of my Father, who is in heaven:

22. many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name have wrought many miracles? and I will then declare unto them,

23. I never owned you, depart from me, ye workers of iniquity.

24. Whoever therefore heareth these words of mine, and performeth them, I will compare him to a prudent man, who built his house on a rock:

25. and the rain fell upon it, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell not; for it was founded upon a rock.

26. And whoever heareth these words of mine, and performeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand:

27. and the rain fell upon it, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell, and the fall thereof was great.

28. And when Jesus had ended these discourses, the people were amazed at his doctrine:

29. for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes. 

## Matthew 8

1. Now as he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him.

2. And behold a leper came and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me:

3. and Jesus stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou cleansed: and immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

4. And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no one; but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.

5. And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto Him a centurion beseeching Him, and saying, Lord,

6. my servant lieth in my house ill of the palsy, grievously afflicted:

7. and Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.

8. But the centurion answering said, Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldst come under my roof, but speak the word, and my servant will be healed:

9. for I also am a man under the authority of others, yet have soldiers under me; and I say to one, go, and he goeth; and to another, come, and he cometh; and to my servant, do this, and he doth it.

10. And when Jesus heard it He marvelled, and said to them that followed Him, Verily, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith even in Israel:

11. but I tell you, that many shall come from the east and from the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven;

12. and the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into the outer darkness; where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

13. And Jesus said to the centurion, Go, and be it unto thee as thou hast believed. And his servant was healed in that very hour.

14. And when Jesus came to Peter's house. He saw his wife's mother lying ill of a fever:

15. and He did but touch her hand, and the fever left her; and she rose up and waited on them.

16. And when it was evening they brought to him many demoniacs: and he cast out the evil spirits with a word, and healed all that were ill: that it might be fulfilled,

17. which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, He took our infirmities himself, and bore our diseases.

18. But when Jesus saw great multitudes about Him, he gave orders for departing to the other side of the lake.

19. And a certain scribe came to Him, and said, Master, I will follow Thee whithersoever Thou goest:

20. and Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the fowls of heaven their nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.

21. But another of his disciples, whom he ordered to follow Him, said unto Him, Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father:

22. but Jesus said unto him; Do thou follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.

23. And when He was entered into the ship, his disciples followed Him:

24. and behold a great tempest rose on the sea, so that the vessel was even covered by the waves; but He was asleep.

25. And His disciples came to Him, and awoke Him, saying, Lord save us, for we are perishing: and He saith unto them,

26. Why are ye so frighted, O ye of little faith? Then He rose up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.

27. And the men wondered, saying, What an amazing person is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him!

28. And when He was come to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, there met Him two demoniacs coming out from the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no one could pass by that way:

29. and they cried out, saying, What have we to do with Thee, Jesus thou Son of God? Art Thou come hither to torment us before the time?

30. Now there was at some distance from them a large herd of swine seeding: and the devils besought Him,

31. saying, If Thou cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of swine:

32. and He said unto them, Go: and they came out and went away into the herd of swine; and lo, all the herd of swine ran furiously down a precipice into the sea,

33. and perished in the waters. And they that were feeding them fled, and went away into the city, and related all these things, as also concerning the demoniacs.

34. And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they intreated Him to depart from their coasts. 

## Matthew 9

1. And He entered into the ship and passed over, and came to his own city:

2. and behold, they brought to Him one that had the palsy laid on a couch: and Jesus seeing their faith said to the paralytic, Take heart my son, for thy sins are forgiven thee.

3. Upon which, some of the scribes said in themselves, This man blasphemeth: but Jesus knowing their surmises,

4. said to them, Why think ye evil in your hearts?

5. For which is easier? To say, thy sins be forgiven thee? or to say, rise up and walk?

6. but that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, Arise (saith He then to the paralytic) and take up thy couch, and go away to thy house.

7. And he rose up and went away to his own house.

8. But when the multitudes saw it, they were amazed, and glorified God, who had given such power to men.

9. And as Jesus was passing from thence, He saw a man sitting at the custom-house, named Matthew; and He saith to him, Follow me: and he rose up and followed Him.

10. And as He was sitting at table in the house of Matthew, behold, several publicans and notorious sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.

11. And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, Why doth your master eat with publicans and sinners?

12. But Jesus hearing them, said unto them, They that are in health need not a physician, but they that are ill: go therefore and learn what that means,

13. "I desire mercy rather than sacrifice:" for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.

14. Then also come to Him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the pharisees fast much, but thy disciples do not fast?

15. And Jesus said unto them, Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn, while the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they will fast.

16. As no one putteth a piece of new cloth to an old garment; for its new patch teareth away from the old garment, and the rent is made worse:

17. nor do they put new wine into old vessels; otherwise, the casks burst, and the wine is spilt, and the vessels are destroyed: but they put new wine into new vessels, and both are preserved.

18. As He was speaking these things to them, behold there came a ruler and worshipped Him, saying, My daughter is at the point of death: but come, I pray Thee, and put thy hand upon her, and she shall live:

19. and Jesus rose up, and followed him; as did also his disciples.

20. (And lo, a woman who had had a flux of blood for twelve years, came close behind Him, and touched the hem of his garment:

21. for she said within herself, If I can but touch his garment, I shall be cured.

22. And Jesus turning about, and seeing her, said, Daughter be comforted, thy faith hath cured thee. And from that time the woman was healed.)

23. And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the musicians, and the people in confusion;

24. He saith unto them, Retire; for the child is not dead, but asleep. And they laughed at Him.

25. But when the people were put out, He went in and took hold of her hand, and the damsel rose up.

26. And the fame of it spread over all the country.

27. And as Jesus was going from thence, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, Have compassion on us, O Son of David.

28. And when He was come into the house, the blind men came to Him: and Jesus saith unto them, Do ye believe that I am able to do this? and they say unto Him, Yes Lord.

29. Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it done unto you: and their eyes were opened.

30. And Jesus strictly charged them, saying, Do not divulge it: but

31. they went out and spread his fame through all that country.

32. And as they were going out, there was brought to Him a dumb man, a demoniac:

33. and when the demon was cast out, the dumb man spake; and the multitudes were amazed, saying, there had never been seen the like in Israel:

34. but the pharisees said, he casts out devils by the prince of the devils.

35. Now Jesus went round to all the cities, and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom of heaven, and healing every disease, and every malady among the people.

36. And when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion towards them; because they were dispersed and scattered like sheep that have no shepherd:

37. upon which He saith to his disciples, The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers few:

38. therefore pray to the Lord of the harvest, that He would send out laborers into his harvest. 

## Matthew 10

1. And He called unto Him his twelve disciples, and gave them power over impure spirits, even to cast them out; and to cure all diseases and every malady whatsoever.

2. Now these are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon, called Peter, and Andrew his brother; Philip, and Bartholomew;

3. Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alpheus, and Lebbeus who was surnamed Thaddeus;

4. Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, even he that betrayed Him.

5. These twelve did Jesus send forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not among the gentiles, neither enter into any city of the Samaritans:

6. but go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

7. And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand: and in confirmation of your doctrine heal the sick,

8. cleanse the leprous, raise the dead, cast out demons; and as ye have received freely, freely give.

9. Take not gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses: take no bag for your journey,

10. nor two coats, nor shoes, nor weapons; for the laborer is worthy of his food.

11. And into whatsoever city or town ye enter, inquire who in it is a worthy person, and there remain till ye leave the place.

12. And when ye come into the house, salute them:

13. and if the family be worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if they be not worthy, your salutation shall return to you.

14. And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hearken to your words; when ye come out of that house or city, shake off the very dust of your feet:

15. for I tell you verily, it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha, in the day of judgement, than for that city.

16. Behold I send you forth as sheep into the midst of wolves: be ye therefore prudent as serpents, and innocent as doves.

17. Beware of evil men; for they will deliver you up to their councils, and will scourge you in their synagogues.

18. And ye shall be brought before governors and kings on my account, for a testimony to them and to the nations:

19. but when they take you up, be not sollicitous how, or what ye shall say; for ye shall be taught in that very instant what ye shall speak: for it is not you that speak,

20. but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh by you.

21. Brother shall betray his brother to death, and the father his child: and children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death:

22. and ye shall be hated by all men for professing my name; but he that perseveres to the end shall certainly be saved.

23. But when they persecute you in one city, flee into another: for verily I tell you, ye shall not finish your commission through the cities of Israel, before the Son of man shall come.

24. The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord:

25. it is sufficient sure for the disciple that he be treated as his master, and the servant as his lord. If then they call the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more his domestics?

26. Be not therefore afraid of them; for there is nothing hid, that shall not be revealed; nor secret, that shall not be made known.

27. What I say to you in private, declare ye in public: and what ye hear as in the ear, preach ye as from the house-tops.

28. And be not afraid of them, who can only kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear Him, who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

29. Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and not one of them shall fall to the ground without the will of your Father:

30. and even the hairs of your head are all numbered.

31. Therefore be not afraid, ye are of more worth than many sparrows.

32. Whosoever then shall own me before men, I also will own him before my Father, who is in heaven:

33. but whosoever shall disown me before men, him will I also disown before my Father who is in heaven.

34. Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to bring peace but division.

35. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law:

36. and those of a man's own family shall be his enemies.

37. He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me:

38. and he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.

39. He that would save his life shall lose it; and he, that loseth his life for my sake, shall find it.

40. He that receiveth you, receiveth me: and he that receiveth me, receiveth Him that sent me.

41. He that receiveth a prophet as a prophet, shall have a prophet's reward: and he that receiveth a righteous man as such, shall receive a righteous man's reward.

42. And whosoever shall give to one of these mean persons but a cup of cold water to drink, as my disciple, I assure you, he shall not lose his reward. 

## Matthew 11

1. And when Jesus had made an end of giving orders to his twelve disciples, He departed from thence to teach and preach in their cities.

2. Now when John heard in prison of the works of Christ,

3. he sent two of his disciples to ask Him, Art thou He who was to come, or are we to expect another?

4. And Jesus said to them in answer, Go and tell John the things which ye hear and see:

5. the blind are restored to sight, and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear; the dead are raised to life, and the poor have the gospel preached to them:

6. and happy is the man who shall not be offended at any thing in me.

7. And as they departed, Jesus took occasion to say to the people concerning John, What went ye out into the desert to see? a reed shaken by the wind?

8. But what went ye out to see? a man clad in fine attire? they that wear rich clothes are in the palaces of kings.

9. But what did ye indeed go out to see? a prophet? Yes, verily, and one superior to a prophet.

10. For this is he, of whom it is written, "Behold I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee."

11. For I assure you that in the whole human race there hath not risen a greater than John the baptist: though the lest in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he:

12. and from the days of John the baptist to this time, the kingdom of heaven is as it were forced into, and the most pressing seize upon it with eagerness.

13. For all the prophets, and the law, did no more than prophesy, till John came:

14. and, if ye are willing to receive the truth, This is that Elias who was to come.

15. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

16. But to what shall I compare this generation? they are like children sitting in the market-places,

17. and calling to their companions, and saying "We have sung and ye have not danced; we have mourned, and ye have not lamented:"

18. for John came neither eating nor drinking as others do, and they say, He is beside himself:

19. the Son of man came eating and drinking like other men, and they call Him a gluttonous man, and a wine-bibber, and a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified by her children.

20. Then began He to upbraid the cities, in which most of his miracles were wrought; because they did not repent.

21. Wo unto thee, Chorazin; wo unto thee, Bethsaida: for if the miracles wrought among you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes:

22. therefore I tell you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgement, than for you.

23. And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted even to heaven, shalt be cast down to hell: for if the miracles, which have been wrought in thee, had been wrought in Sodom, it would have remained unto this day.

24. Moreover I tell you, that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgement, than for thee.

25. And upon this occasion Jesus opened his mouth and said, "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and knowing, and hast revealed them to babes:

26. even so, Father, for it was thy good pleasure that so it should be."

27. All things are delivered to me by my Father: and no one knoweth the Son, but the Father; nor does any one know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son is pleased to reveal Him.

28. Come unto me therefore all ye who are labouring and oppressed, and I will give you ease.

29. Take but my yoke upon you, and learn of me, (for I am meek and lowly in heart,) and ye shall find refreshment to your souls:

30. for my yoke is easy, and my burthen is light. 

## Matthew 12

1. About this time as Jesus passed through the cornfields on the sabbath-day, his disciples being hungry began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat them.

2. And when the pharisees saw it they said to Him, See, thy disciples are doing what is not lawful for them to do on the sabbath.

3. But He replied, Have ye not read what David did, when he, and his attendants, were hungry? how he went into the house of God,

4. and did eat the shew-bread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor those that were with him; but for the priests only? or have ye not read in the law,

5. what profane sort of work the priests do in the temple on the sabbath-days, and yet are blameless?

6. But I tell you, that a greater than the temple is here:

7. and if ye had known what that scripture means, "I desire mercy rather than sacrifice," ye would not have condemned the guiltless.

8. For the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath.

9. And he went away and came into their synagogue: and there being a man there who had a withered hand,

10. they asked Him, if it were lawful to heal on the sabbath-days? that they might accuse Him.

11. But He said unto them, What man of you shall have one of his sheep fall into a pit on the sabbath-day, and will not lay hold of it and lift it out?

12. And of how much more worth is a man than a sheep? Sure then it is lawful to do good on the sabbath-days.

13. Then saith He to the man, Stretch out thine hand: and he stretched it out, and it was made sound like the other.

14. But the pharisees went out of the synagogue and took counsel together against Him, how they might destroy Him:

15. but Jesus knew it, and withdrew from thence; and great multitudes followed Him with their sick,

16. and he healed them all, charging them not to make Him known:

17. that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Behold my servant whom I have chosen,

18. my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon Him, and He shall declare judgement to the nations: He shall not contend,

19. nor cry aloud, nor shall any one hear his voice in the streets:

20. a bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax he will not extinguish, till He send forth judgement victorious.

21. And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.

22. Then was brought to Him a demoniac, who was blind and dumb; and he healed Him, so that the blind and dumb man both spake and saw:

23. and all the multitudes were amazed, and said, "Is not this the Son of David?"

24. which the pharisees hearing, said, "He only casts out demons by the help of Beelzebub the prince of the devils."

25. But Jesus, who well knew their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself becomes desolate; and no city, or family, divided against itself can stand:

26. if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?

27. And if I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebub, by whom do your own people cast them out? wherefore they shall be your judges:

28. but if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils, then certainly the kingdom of God is come unto you.

29. Or, how can any one enter into the house of a strong man, and take away his goods, unless he first overpower the strong man? and then indeed he may strip his house.

30. He that is not with me, is against me; and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth.

31. Wherefore, I tell you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men; but the blasphemy against the holy Spirit shall not be forgiven them:

32. and if any one speak against the Son of man, it may be forgiven him: but if any one speak against the holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this life, nor in that to come.

33. Either allow the tree to be good, and it's fruit good; or shew the tree to be corrupt, and it's fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by it's fruit.

34. O race of vipers, how can ye speak good things, who are yourselves so wicked? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.

35. A good man out of the good treasure of the heart produceth good things; and a wicked man out of the wicked treasure uttereth wicked things:

36. but I tell you, that of every idle word, which men shall speak, they shall give an account in the day of judgement; for by thy words thou shalt be justified,

37. and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.

38. Then some of the scribes and pharisees answered Him, saying, Master, we should be glad to see a sign from thee:

39. but He replied and said unto them, This wicked and degenerate race demand a sign; but no sign shall be given them, except that of the prophet Jonah:

40. for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

41. So that the men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgement against this generation, and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold a greater than Jonas is here.

42. The queen of the South too, shall rise up in the day of judgement against this generation, and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold a greater than Solomon is here.

43. Now when an impure spirit is gone out of a man, he wanders through dry desert places, seeking rest, and findeth none:

44. then saith he, I will return into my house, that I came out of; and when he cometh, he findeth it empty, swept, and set off to advantage:

45. then he goeth and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there; and so the last state of that man is worse than the first. And thus shall it be to this wicked generation.

46. Now as He was yet discoursing to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, and desired to speak to Him:

47. and somebody said to Him, "Here are thy mother and thy brethren standing without, desiring to speak to thee."

48. But in answer to him that told Him, He said, "Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?"

49. and stretching out his hand towards his disciples, He said, "Behold my mother and my brethren:"

50. for whosoever doth the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is to me as my brother and sister and mother. 

## Matthew 13

1. Now on the same day, Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the sea-side:

2. and many people were gathered together to bear Him, so that He went into a ship and sat down, and all the multitude stood upon the shore; and He spake to them many things in parables,

3. saying, "Behold a sower went out to sow;

4. and as he was sowing, some seeds fell by the way-side, and the birds came and ate them up:

5. some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth; and they soon sprung up indeed, because they had no depth of earth;

6. but when the sun rose, they were burnt up, and withered; because they had no root:

7. and others fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked them:

8. but others fell on good ground, and yielded fruit, some an hundred-fold, some sixty, and some thirty.

9. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."

10. And the disciples came to Him and said, Why dost thou speak to them in parables?

11. And He answered them, saying, Because it is granted unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not granted:

12. for whosoever really hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundantly; but whosoever thus hath not, even that which he hath, shall be taken away from him:

13. for this reason I speak to them in parables; because though they see, they will not see; and though they hear, they will not hear, nor understand.

14. And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, Ye shall hear by the hearing of the ear, and not understand; and in seeing ye shall see, and not perceive: for the heart of this people is grown stupid,

15. and their ears are dull of hearing, and they have closed their eyes; least they should see at all with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.

16. But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear:

17. for indeed I tell you, that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see the things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear what ye hear, and have not heard them.

18. Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. When any one heareth the word of the gospel-kingdom,

19. and regardeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and snatcheth away that which was sown in his heart: this is he who received the seed as by the way-side.

20. And he who received the seed as upon stony grounds, is one that heareth the word and immediately receiveth it with joy:

21. yet hath he no root in himself, and therefore is but for a short season; and when affliction cometh, or persecution on account of the word, he is as soon disgusted.

22. And he that received the seed among the thorns, is one that likewise heareth the word; but the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches choketh the word, and so it becometh unfruitful.

23. But he who received the seed into good ground, is one that heareth and understandeth the word, who indeed beareth fruit, and yieldeth, like fertile lands, some an hundred-fold, some sixty, some thirty.

24. Another parable propounded He unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a man, who sowed good grain in his ground:

25. but while men were asleep, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away.

26. Now when the blade shot forth, and produced the corn, then the tares also appeared.

27. So the servants came to their master, and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? whence then are the tares?

28. And he said unto them, Some enemy hath done this. The servants therefore said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?

29. But he said, No: least in plucking up the tares ye root up the corn along with them.

30. Let both grow together till harvest, and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, First gather the weeds together, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but carry the wheat into my barn.

31. Another parable delivered He unto them, saying, The gospel-kingdom is like a grain of mustard-seed, which a man took and sowed in his field.

32. Which is indeed one of the lest of all seeds: but when it is grown, is the greatest among herbs, and even becometh a tree; so that the birds of the air come and lodge in it's branches.

33. Another parable spake He unto them, saying, The gospel-kingdom is like leaven, which a woman took and put into a large quantity of dough, till the whole was leavened.

34. All these things spake Jesus in parables to the multitudes; and at this time He spake nothing to them without a parable:

35. that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables, I will publish things which have been concealed from the foundation of the world.

36. Then Jesus leaving the multitude went into the house; and his disciples came to Him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field:

37. and He answered them, and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;

38. the field is the world; the good seed are the children of my kingdom; and the tares are the children of the wicked one.

39. The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.

40. As therefore the tares are gathered together, and burnt in the fire; so shall it be in the end of the world:

41. the Son of man will send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all that commit offences, and those who do iniquity, and shall cast them into the furnace of fire,

42. and there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

43. But the righteous shall then shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

44. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hid in a field, which a man having found conceals, and being rejoiced at it goes and sells all that he has, and purchases that field.

45. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking precious pearls,

46. who, having found one of great value, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.

47. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net, that was cast into the sea, and inclosed fishes of various sorts;

48. which, when it was full, they dragged to the shore, and sat down and gathered the good into vessels, and threw out the bad.

49. So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous;

50. and shall cast them into the fiery furnace, and there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

51. Then saith Jesus unto them, Did ye understand all these? they say unto Him, Yes, Lord: and He said unto them,

52. Therefore every teacher, who has been thus instructed in the knowledge of the kingdom of heaven, is like a master of a family, who brings forth out of his store things new and old.

53. And when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence:

54. and came into his own country, and taught them in their synagogues; so that they were amazed and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom and these powers?

55. Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?

56. and his sisters, are they not all here among us? from whence then hath this man all these things?

57. So they were prejudiced against Him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is no where less honoured than in his own country, and in his own family.

58. And he did not many miracles there, because of their unbelief. 

## Matthew 14

1. At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the fame of Jesus,

2. and said to his servants, This is John the baptist, he is certainly risen from the dead, and therefore miraculous things are done by him:

3. for Herod had apprehended John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife;

4. for John said to Him, It is not lawful for thee to have her: and he would have put him to death,

5. but that he was afraid of the people; for they esteemed him as a prophet.

6. But when Herod's birth-day was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod, so

7. that he promised her with an oath to give her whatever she would ask:

8. and she, being before instructed by her mother, said, Give me here in a dish the head of John the baptist:

9. at which the king was distressed, but because of his oath, and of those who sat at table with him, he ordered it to be given her;

10. and he sent and beheaded John in the prison,

11. and his head was brought in a dish, and given to the young princess, who carried it to her mother:

12. and his disciples came and took up the body and buried it, and then went and told Jesus.

13. And when Jesus heard it, He departed from thence in a ship to a solitary place of retirement: but the people hearing where He was followed Him on foot from the cities:

14. and when Jesus came out of the ship, He saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them; and He healed their sick.

15. Now when it was evening his disciples came to Him and said, This is a desert place, and meal-time is now past; dismiss the people, that they may go away to the towns, and buy themselves victuals.

16. But Jesus said to them, they have no need to go away, do ye give them something to eat.

17. And they said, we have nothing here but five loaves and two fishes:

18. and He said, bring them hither to me.

19. And having ordered the multitudes to sit down upon the grass, and taken the five loaves and the two fishes, He looked up to heaven and blessed them; and He brake the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the people: and they did all eat, and were satisfied;

20. and they took up what was left even of fragments twelve baskets full.

21. Now they that had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.

22. And presently after Jesus obliged the disciples to get into the ship, and to go before Him to the other side, while He dismissed the multitudes:

23. and when He had dismissed them, He went up to a hill in private to pray.

24. And in the evening He was there alone. Now the ship was by this time in the midst of the sea, and violently tossed by the waves; for the wind was contrary:

25. but in the fourth watch of the night Jesus came to them walking on the sea:

26. and when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were affrighted and said, It is an apparition;

27. and they cried out for fear: but Jesus immediately spake to them, saying, Take courage, it is I, be not afraid.

28. Then Peter answered Him and said, Lord, if it be thou, command me to come unto thee upon the waters.

29. And He said, Come.

30. And Peter went down from the ship and walked upon the waters to go to Jesus: but seeing the wind boisterous, he was afraid, and beginning to sink cried out, Lord, save me.

31. And Jesus, immediately stretching forth his hand, laid hold of him, and saith to him, O man of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?

32. So they got into the ship, and the wind ceased.

33. Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped Him, saying, Thou art indeed the Son of God.

34. And they passed over and came into the country of Gennesaret.

35. And the men of that place getting knowledge of Him, sent into all that country about; and they brought to Him all that were ill;

36. and intreated Him that they might but touch the border of his garment; and as many as touched Him were made perfectly well. 

## Matthew 15

1. Then came to Jesus the scribes and pharisees from Jerusalem saying,

2. Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat.

3. But He answered and said unto them, And why do ye transgress the commandment of God for your tradition?

4. For God commanded saying, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, He that revileth father or mother, let him be put to death:

5. but ye say, If any man say to his father or mother, "that which thou mightest be profited by from me is a gift to the temple,"

6. and so honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. And thus have ye made void the commandment of God by your tradition.

7. Well did Esaias prophecy concerning you,

8. saying, This people approach me with their mouth, and honour me with their lips, but their heart is far from me:

9. but in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the injunctions of men.

10. And He called the multitude to Him, and said unto them, Hear and understand it:

11. not that which goeth into the mouth defileth the man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this polluteth the man.

12. Whereupon his disciples came and said to Him, Dost thou know that the pharisees, when they heard this assertion, were offended at it?

13. But He answered and said, Every plantation which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up.

14. Regard them not; for they are blind guides of the blind: and if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the ditch.

15. Then Peter answered, and said unto Him, Explain to us this parable.

16. And Jesus replied, Are ye also still void of understanding?

17. Do ye not yet know, that whatever goeth into the mouth passeth to the belly and is discharged downwards?

18. But the things, which proceed out of the mouth, come from the heart, and those defile a man.

19. For out of the heart proceed wicked disputings, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false-witnessings, slanders:

20. these defile a man, but to eat without washing the hands doth not defile him.

21. And Jesus went from thence, and retired into the parts adjacent to Tyre and Sidon.

22. And there came out of those quarters a Canaanitish woman, and cried to Him saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; for my daughter is grievously tormented by a demon.

23. But he answered her not a word: and his disciples came and intreated Him, saying, Send her away, for she crieth importunately after us.

24. But he answered and said, I am sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

25. However, she came and worshipped Him, saying, Lord help me.

26. But he answered, It is not fit to take the children's bread and throw it to dogs: and she said, True, Lord;

27. yet the dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from the table of their masters.

28. Then Jesus answering, said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it therefore unto thee as thou desirest. And her daughter was cured from that very hour.

29. And Jesus departed from thence, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and going up to a mountain He sat down there.

30. And great multitudes came to Him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others; and laid them at the feet of Jesus, and He healed them.

31. So that the people wondered when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed become sound, the lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel.

32. Then Jesus called his disciples to Him and said, I am moved with compassion to the multitude, for they have been with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: I will not let them go away fasting, least they faint in the way.

33. And his disciples replied, Whence can we have so much bread in this desert place as to satisfy so great a multitude?

34. And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? and they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.

35. Then He bid the people sit down on the ground;

36. and taking the seven loaves and the fishes, when He had given thanks, He brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.

37. And they did all eat, and were satisfied: and they took up what was left even of fragments seven baskets full.

38. Now they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.

39. Then he dismissed the multitudes, and went into a ship, and came to the coasts of Magdala. 

## Matthew 16

1. And the pharisees and sadducees came to Him, and captiously asked Him to shew them a sign from heaven.

2. But He answered them, In the evening ye say, It will be fair weather, for the sky is red:

3. and in the morning, It will be foul weather to-day, for the sky is red and lowring. Ye hypocrites, can ye distinguish the appearance of the sky, and not discern the signs of these times?

4. This wicked and degenerate race demand a sign; but no sign shall be given them, except that of the prophet Jonah. And so He left them and went away.

5. Now when his disciples departed to the other side, they forgot to take bread with them:

6. and therefore when Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees,

7. they said one to another, It is because we have taken no bread.

8. And Jesus knowing their thoughts said to them, O ye of little faith, why do ye argue among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?

9. Do ye not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves divided among five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?

10. nor the seven loaves among four thousand, and how many baskets-full ye took away?

11. How is it then that ye do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread, when I bid you to beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees?

12. Then they understood, that He did not bid them beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the pharisees and of the sadducees.

13. And when Jesus came into the parts of Cesarea Philippi, He asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I, the Son of man, am?

14. And they answered, Some say thou art John the Baptist, others Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets.

15. But, saith He unto them, whom do ye say that I am?

16. And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ the Son of the living God.

17. And Jesus replied and said unto him, Blessed art thou Simon son of Jonas, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven.

18. And I also say unto thee, as thou art called Peter, so upon this rock, which thou hast confessed, will I build my church, and the gates of death shall not prevail against it.

19. And I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

20. Then charged He his disciples that they should tell no one that He was the Messiah.

21. And from that time began Jesus to acquaint his disciples, that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, and chief priests, and scribes; and be put to death, and be raised again on the third day.

22. Then Peter took Him and began to expostulate with Him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: may this never be unto thee.

23. But He turned and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan, thou art an offence to me; for thou regardest not the things of God, but those that be of men.

24. Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any one is willing to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me:

25. for he that would save his life shall lose it; but he that would lose his life for my sake shall find it.

26. For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give as a ransom for his soul?

27. For the Son of man will come in the glory of his father, with his angels, and then he will recompense every one according to his practice.

28. And I tell you of a truth, there be some of those standing here, who shall not taste of death, till they have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom. 

## Matthew 17

1. And after six days, Jesus taketh Peter, and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up to a high mountain apart;

2. and was transfigured before them: and his face shone like the sun, and his raiment became white as the light.

3. And they saw Moses and Elias talking with Him.

4. Then Peter said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou pleasest, let us make three tabernacles here, one for Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.

5. And as he was speaking, lo a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him.

6. And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.

7. But Jesus came and touched them and said, Rise up and be not afraid.

8. And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw none but Jesus only.

9. And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no one, till the Son of man be risen from the dead.

10. And his disciples asked Him, saying, Why then do the scribes say, that Elias must first come?

11. Jesus said unto them, Elias doth indeed come first, and shall set all things right.

12. But I tell you that Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but did what they pleased to him: and so is the Son of man to suffer by them.

13. Then the disciples understood that He spake to them of John the baptist.

14. And when they were come to the multitude, there came to Him a man kneeling down and saying,

15. Lord, have compassion upon my son, for he is lunatic and grievously afflicted; for he often falleth into the fire, and often into the water.

16. And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not heal him.

17. Then Jesus answered and said, O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you?

18. Bring him here to me. And when Jesus rebuked him, the demon departed out of him, and the child was cured from that time.

19. Then came the disciples to Jesus in private, and said, Why could not we cast him out?

20. And Jesus said unto them, because of your unbelief: for verily I tell you, if ye had but faith as a grain of mustard-seed, ye might say to this mountain, Remove from hence thither, and it shall remove: and nothing would be impossible to you.

21. But this kind is not to be cast out but by prayer and fasting.

22. And while they were in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, the Son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men:

23. and they will put Him to death, and the third day He shall be raised again. And they were exceedingly grieved.

24. And when they were come to Capernaum, the receivers of the tribute-money came to Peter and said, Doth not your master pay tribute? Yes, saith he.

25. And when he came into the house, Jesus prevented him and said, What thinkest thou, Simon? Of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? Of their own children, or of other people?

26. Peter saith unto Him, Of others. Jesus answered him, Then are the children free:

27. but that we may not give them offence, go to the sea-side and throw in a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and open its mouth, and thou shalt find a piece of money: that take and give them for me and thee. 

## Matthew 18

1. At that time came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who is to be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?

2. And Jesus calling to Him a little child, set it in the midst of them,

3. and said, Verily I declare unto you, unless ye be converted, and become like little children, ye shall never enter into the kingdom of heaven.

4. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, he shall be greatest in the kingdom of heaven:

5. and whoever shall receive one such little child for my sake, receiveth me:

6. but whosoever shall lay a stumbling-block in the way of one of these little ones, who believe in me, it were better for him that a milstone were hung on his neck, and that he were thrown into the sea.

7. Wo will be to the world from such offenses; for it is of necessity that offenses come: but wo to that man by whom the offense cometh.

8. If then thy hand or thy foot cause thee to offend, cut them off and cast them from thee; it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire:

9. and if thine eye cause thee to offend, pluck it out and cast it from thee; it is better for thee to enter into life with but one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell-fire.

10. See that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I tell you, that their angels in heaven do continually appear in the presence of my father, who is in heaven:

11. for the Son of man came from thence to save that which was lost.

12. What think ye? if any man had an hundred sheep, and one of them should go astray, would he not leave the ninety and nine, and go upon the hills, and seek that which is gone astray?

13. And if he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more on account of that, than of the ninety nine which went not astray.

14. Even so it is not the will of your heavenly Father, that any one of these little ones should be lost.

15. And if thy brother trespass against thee, go and expostulate with him alone; if he hearken to thee, thou hast gained thy brother:

16. but if he regard thee not, take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.

17. And if he disregard them, tell it to the church: but if he disregard the church too, let him be unto thee as an heathen and a publican.

18. Verily I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.

19. And I tell you moreover, that if but two of you shall agree on earth concerning any thing which they would ask for, it shall be granted them by my Father who is in heaven:

20. for where two or three are assembled together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.

21. Then Peter came to Him and said, Lord, how often shall my brother offend against me, and I forgive him? to seven times?

22. Jesus answereth him, I tell thee not, to seven times, but to seventy times seven.

23. And therefore the gospel-kingdom is like unto a king, who had a mind to settle accounts with his servants:

24. and when he began to reckon, there was brought to him one, who was debtor in ten thousand talents:

25. and not having it to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife and children and all that he had; and payment to be made.

26. The servant therefore fell prostrate before him, saying, Lord, bear with me a while, and I will pay thee all:

27. and his lord had compassion on him, and discharged him, and forgave him the debt.

28. But that same servant, as he was going out, met with one of his fellow-servants, who owed him but an hundred pence; and he laid hold on him and seized him by the throat, saying, Pay me what thou owest me:

29. and his fellow-servant fell down at his feet, and intreated him, saying, Bear with me a while, and I will pay thee all.

30. And he would not: but went away and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt.

31. Now when his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were very much grieved, and came and acquainted their lord with all that had passed.

32. Then his lord called for him again, and said to him, Thou wicked slave, I forgave thee all that vast debt at thy request,

33. and oughtest not thou to have had compassion on thy fellow-servant, even as I had on thee?

34. And his lord being highly provoked delivered him to the officers, till he should pay all that was owing to him.

35. Thus will my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts their trespasses. 

## Matthew 19

1. And when Jesus had finished these discourses, He departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judea, beyond Jordan:

2. and great multitudes followed Him, and there He healed them.

3. And the pharisees came to Him to ensnare Him, and asked Him, whether it was lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?

4. And He answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that He, who made them at first, made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother,

5. and be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh:

6. so that they are no longer two, but one flesh. And therefore what God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.

7. They say unto Him, Why then did Moses order a bill of divorce to be given, and so to put her away?

8. He answered them, Moses because of your hardheartedness, permitted you to put away your wives; but it was not so from the beginning:

9. and I tell you, that whosoever putteth away his wife, except for whoredom, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and he that marrieth her so put away committeth adultery.

10. His disciples say unto Him, if the case of a man with his wife be thus, it is not adviseable to marry:

11. but He said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying of yours, but those only who have the gift of continence:

12. for there are some eunuchs, who were born so from their mother's womb; and there be some, who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He that can receive this saying, let him receive it.

13. Then were brought to Him little children, that He might put his hands upon them, and bless them: and the disciples rebuked them;

14. but Jesus said, Suffer the children to come to me, and do not hinder them: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.

15. And when He had laid his hands on them, he departed thence.

16. And behold, there came one to Him, and said, Good master, what good shall I do, that I may have eternal life?

17. And He said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou desirest to enter into life, keep the commandments.

18. He saith unto Him, Which? And Jesus answered, Thou shalt do no murther, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and mother;

19. and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self.

20. The young man saith unto Him, All these have I kept from my youth: wherein am I yet deficient?

21. Jesus replied, If thou wouldst be perfect, go, sell thy estate, and give it to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come and follow me.

22. But when the young man heard that, he went away sorrowful; for he had large possessions.

23. Then said Jesus to his disciples, Verily I tell you, that a rich man shall with difficulty enter into the kingdom of heaven:

24. and again I tell you, It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

25. His disciples, when they heard this, were exceedingly struck, and said, Who then can be saved?

26. But Jesus looking upon them said unto them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.

27. Then Peter replied and said unto Him, Behold we have quitted all and have followed thee; what then shall we have?

28. And Jesus said unto them, Verily I tell you, that ye who have followed me, in the regeneration, when the son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon the twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel:

29. yea and every one who hath left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, shall receive an hundred-fold, and shall inherit eternal life.

30. But many that are first shall be last, and the last first. 

## Matthew 20

1. For the gospel-kingdom is like the master of a family, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard:

2. and agreeing with the men for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard:

3. and going out about the third hour he saw others standing in the market-place doing nothing,

4. and said to them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and what is reasonable I will give you: so they went.

5. And going out again about the sixth and ninth hour he did in like manner.

6. And going out about the eleventh hour, he found others standing without work, and saith to them, Why stand ye here all the day doing nothing?

7. They say unto him, because no one hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatever is reasonable ye shall receive.

8. Now when evening was come, the owner of the vineyard saith to his steward, Call the work-men and pay them their hire, beginning from the last even to the first.

9. And when those came who were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every one a penny:

10. but when the first came, they thought that they should receive more; and they also received every one a penny.

11. And after they had received it they murmured against the master of the house,

12. saying, These last have worked but one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, who have borne the burthen and heat of the day.

13. But he answered, and said to one of them, Friend, I do thee no wrong; didst not thou agree with me for a penny?

14. Take what is thine, and be gone: it is my pleasure to give to this last as I do to thee;

15. and may I not do what I will with my own?

16. Is thine eye evil because I am good? Thus the last shall be first, and the first last; for there are many called, but few chosen.

17. And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them, Behold we are going up to Jerusalem,

18. and the son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death,

19. and deliver Him up to the gentiles, to insult, and to scourge, and to crucify Him. But on the third day He shall rise again.

20. Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Him, together with her two sons, falling down before Him, and presenting a petition to Him.

21. And He said unto her, What dost thou desire? She saith unto Him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on the left in thy kingdom.

22. But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask: are ye able to drink of the cup which I am going to drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?

23. They replied, We are able. And He saith unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of my cup, and shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give, but to those for whom it is prepared by my Father.

24. And when the other ten heard it, they were provoked at the two brethren:

25. but Jesus called them to Him and said, Ye know that the princes of the gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority upon them:

26. it shall not be so among you; but whosoever would be great among you, let him be your minister, and whoever would be chief among you,

27. let him be your servant:

28. as the Son of man came not to be ministred unto, but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many.

29. And as they were going from Jericho, a great multitude followed Him:

30. and behold, two blind men siting by the way-side, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.

31. And the people rebuked them, that they might hold their peace: but they cried out the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.

32. And Jesus stopt and called them, and said, What do ye desire me to do for you?

33. They answered Him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.

34. And Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes; and straightway their eyes received sight, and they followed Him. 

## Matthew 21

1. And when they drew nigh to Jerusalem and were come to Bethphage at the mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,

2. saying unto them, Go into the village over-against you, and ye will find directly an ass tied and a colt with her: loose them and bring them to me:

3. and if any one say any thing to you, tell him the Lord hath need of them, and he will immediately send them.

4. Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying, Tell ye the daughter of Sion,

5. behold, thy king cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, even a colt the fole of an ass.

6. And the disciples went, and did as Jesus ordered them,

7. and brought the ass and the colt, and threw their clothes over them, and set Him upon them.

8. And great numbers spread their garments in the way, and others cut off boughs from the trees, and strewed them in the way:

9. and the multitudes, that went before and that followed, cried saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: blessed be He that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.

10. And when He came into Jerusalem, all the city was in a commotion, saying, Who is this?

11. And the people answered, This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee.

12. And Jesus went into the temple of God, and drove out all that were selling and buying in the court of the temple, and threw down the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold doves:

13. and said to them, It is written, "My house shall be called the house of prayer," but ye have made it a den of thieves.

14. And there came to Him in the temple both blind and lame, and He healed them:

15. but when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonders that He wrought, and the children crying out in the temple, Hosanna to the Son of David, they were vexed to the heart, and said to Him, Dost thou hear what these say?

16. And Jesus saith unto them, Yes, have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast procured praise?

17. And He left them and went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there.

18. Now in the morning as He was returning to the city, He was hungry;

19. and seeing a fig-tree by the way, He went up to it, and finding nothing upon it but leaves, He saith to it, Let no fruit ever hereafter grow out of thee: and the fig-tree withered immediately.

20. And the disciples seeing it were amazed and said, How suddenly is the fig-tree withered!

21. but Jesus answering said unto them, Verily I tell you, if ye have faith and doubt not, ye shall not only be able to do this to a fig-tree, but also if ye shall say to this mountain, "Be thou removed and cast into the sea," it shall be done.

22. And all things whatsoever ye ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.

23. And when He was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching, and said, By what authority dost thou these things, and who gave thee this authority?

24. but Jesus answered them, I also will ask you one question, which if ye tell me, I will likewise tell you by what authority I do these things.

25. The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves saying, If we say, from heaven, He will reply, Why then did ye not believe him?

26. But if we say, of men, we fear the people, for they all esteem John as a prophet.

27. And therefore in answer to Jesus, they said, We do not know: and He said unto them, Neither do I tell you, by what authority I do these things.

28. But what think ye of this? There was a man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, Son, go, work to day in my vineyard:

29. and he answered I will not; but afterwards repenting, he went.

30. And coming to the second, he spake in like manner: and he answered, Yes, Sir; and went not.

31. Now which of the two did the will of his father? They say unto Him, The first. Jesus replied, Verily I say unto you, that publicans and prostitutes enter into the kingdom of God before you:

32. for John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye did not believe him; but publicans and harlots believed him; and though ye saw that, ye did not repent afterwards, to believe him.

33. Hear another parable, There was a certain man, a master of a family, that planted a vineyard, and made a fence about it, and put a wine-press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and travelled abroad.

34. And when the fruit-season drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive the fruits of it:

35. and the husbandmen took his servants and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.

36. And he sent again other servants more than the first: and they did the like to them.

37. At last he sent unto them his Son, saying, They will reverence my Son.

38. But when the husbandmen saw the Son, they said among themselves, This is the heir, come, let us kill him, and seize on his inheritance:

39. so they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew him.

40. When therefore the lord of the vineyard cometh, what will he do to those husbandmen?

41. They answer, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out the vineyard to other husbandmen, who will render him the fruits in their seasons.

42. Then saith Jesus to them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, "The stone which the builders refused, is made the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?"

43. Therefore I tell you, that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation, that will bring forth the fruits thereof.

44. And he that stumbleth at this stone shall be bruised, but on whomsoever it falls, it will crush him to pieces.

45. And when the chief priests and pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that He spake of them:

46. and would have seized Him, but that they were afraid of the people; because they took Him for a prophet. 

## Matthew 22

1. And Jesus resuming his discourse spake unto them again in parables,

2. saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king, who made a wedding-feast for his son;

3. and sent his servants to call those that were invited to the wedding: and they would not come.

4. Then he sent other servants, saying, Tell them that are invited, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready; come to the wedding.

5. But they slighted him, and went away, one to his field and another to his merchandize:

6. and others seized his servants, and shamefully abused them, and slew them.

7. And when the king heard of it, he was highly provoked, and sent his troops, and destroyed those murderers, and burnt their city.

8. Then saith he to his servants, The feast is ready, but they that were invited were not worthy of it:

9. go therefore into the public streets, and as many as ye meet with invite to the wedding.

10. And those servants went out into the high-ways, and brought in all they met with, both bad and good: and the wedding was filled with guests.

11. But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man that had not put on a wedding-garment, and saith to him,

12. Friend, how camest thou in here without a wedding-garment? and he was struck speechless.

13. Then said the king to his attendants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him up, and throw him out into the darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of the teeth:

14. for there are many called, but few approved.

15. Then the pharisees went and consulted how they might insnare Him in his discourse.

16. And they send to Him their disciples along with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art a man of truth, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest for any man; for thou regardest not the person of men: Tell us therefore what thou thinkest,

17. Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar, or not?

18. But Jesus knew their malice, and said, Why do ye tempt me, ye hypocrites?

19. Shew me the tribute-money. And they brought Him a Roman Penny.

20. And He saith unto them, Whose image and inscription is this?

21. They answered, Cesar's. Then saith He unto them, Render therefore to Cesar the things that are Cesar's; and to God the things that are God's.

22. And when they heard this, they marvelled, and left Him and went away.

23. On the same day came the sadducees to Him, who say there is no resurrection,

24. and asked Him, saying, Master, Moses said, If any man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother.

25. Now there were with us seven brothers, and the first married and died, and having no issue left his wife to his brother;

26. likewise the second also, and the third, even to seven;

27. and last of all the woman died also;

28. therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.

29. But Jesus answered them, Ye are mistaken, not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God:

30. for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels of God in heaven.

31. But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read what is spoken to you by God,

32. saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

33. And when the people heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.

34. But when the pharisees heard that He had silenced the sadducees,

35. they gathered together again, and one of them, an interpreter of the law, propounded a question, to try Him,

36. and said, Master, which is the greatest commandment in the law?

37. And Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind: this is the first and great command.

38. And the second is like it,

39. Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

40. On these two precepts depend all the law and the prophets.

41. Now while the pharisees were thus gathered together, Jesus asked them,

42. saying, What think ye of the Messiah? whose son is He? They say unto Him, David's.

43. He saith unto them, How then does David by inspiration call Him Lord,

44. saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, "Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?"

45. therefore if David call Him Lord, how is He his son?

46. And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did any dare, from that day, to ask Him any more such questions. 

## Matthew 23

1. Then spake Jesus to the people and to his disciples, saying,

2. The scribes and pharisees sit in the seat of Moses:

3. observe therefore and do all things whatsoever they tell you to observe; but do not ye according to their works, for they say and do not:

4. for they bind grievous and intolerable burthens, and impose them upon men; but they themselves will not put a finger to them:

5. but they do all their works to be seen by men; they make their phylacteries broad, and enlarge the fringes of their garments,

6. and love the uppermost places at feasts,

7. and the chief seats in the synagogues, and salutations in public assemblies, and to be called by men Rabbi, Rabbi.

8. But be not ye called Rabbi; for one is your instructor even Christ, and ye are all brethren.

9. Neither call any man upon earth Father; for one is your Father, who is in heaven:

10. neither be ye called masters; for one is your master, even Christ.

11. But let him that is greatest among you be your minister: and whosoever will exalt himself shall be abased,

12. and whosoever will humble himself shall be exalted.

13. But wo unto you scribes and pharisees, hypocrites, who shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, nor suffer those that are entering to go in.

14. Wo unto you scribes and pharisees, hypocrites; for ye devour widows houses, and for a cover make long prayers: therefore ye shall receive the heavier judgement.

15. Wo unto you scribes and pharisees, hypocrites: for ye compass sea and land to make a proselyte, and when he is gained, ye make him more the child of hell than yourselves.

16. Wo unto you, ye blind guides, who say, If any one swear by the temple, it is nothing;

17. but if any man swear by the gold of the temple, the oath is binding. Foolish and blind creatures! for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?

18. And, If any one swear by the altar, it is nothing; but if any one swear by the gift upon it, he is bound.

19. O foolish and blind! for which is greater, the gift, or the altar which sanctifieth the gift?

20. He then, that sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it and by all things upon it:

21. and he, that sweareth by the temple, sweareth by it, and by Him that dwelleth in it:

22. and he, that sweareth by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by Him that sitteth upon it.

23. Wo unto you scribes and pharisees, hypocrites, who tithe even your mint, and anise, and cummin, but neglect the weightier matters of the law, judgement, mercy, and fidelity: these ye ought undoubtedly to practise, and not to omit the others.

24. Blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel!

25. Wo unto you scribes and pharisees, hypocrites; for ye clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but within they are full of rapine and intemperance:

26. thou blind pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the dish, that the outside of them may be also clean.

27. Wo unto you scribes and pharisees, hypocrites; who are like whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful without, but within are full of the bones of the dead, and all manner of filthiness;

28. so do ye likewise outwardly appear to men to be righteous, but within are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

29. Wo unto you scribes and pharisees, hypocrites; who build the tombs of the prophets, and adorn the monuments of the just,

30. and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been concerned with them in shedding the blood of the prophets:

31. so that ye are witnesses yourselves, that ye are the children of those who killed the prophets:

32. fill up then the measure of your fathers, ye serpents, ye brood of vipers:

33. how can ye escape the damnation of hell?

34. For behold I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes; and some of them ye will kill and crucify, and some of them ye will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:

35. that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel, to the blood of Zacharias the son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.

36. Verily I tell you, all these things shall come upon this generation.

37. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!

38. Behold your house shall be left you desolate:

39. for I tell you, ye shall not see me after this, till ye shall say, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord. 

## Matthew 24

1. And as Jesus went out, and was departing from the temple, his disciples came to observe to Him the magnificent buildings.

2. But Jesus said unto them, Do ye see all these things? Verily I tell you, there shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be demolished.

3. And when He was got to the mount of olives, the disciples came to Him in private and said, Tell us when these things shall be, and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world.

4. And Jesus answered them, See that no one deceive you:

5. for many shall come in my name saying, I am the Christ, and shall deceive many.

6. And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, but be not troubled; for all these must indeed come to pass, but the end is not yet.

7. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes in several places:

8. all which are but the beginning of sorrows.

9. Then shall they afflict you, and kill you; and ye shall be hated by all nations for my name:

10. and then will many take offense, and betray one another, and hate one another: and many false prophets will rise up and deceive many:

11. and because iniquity shall abound,

12. the love of many will grow cold.

13. But he that endures to the end, shall be saved:

14. and this gospel of the kingdom of heaven shall be preached in all the world, for a testimony to all the nations; and then shall the end come.

15. When therefore ye shall see the desolating abomination, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing at the holy place, (let him, that readeth, attend) then let those in Judea flee to the mountains:

16. let not him that is at the top of the house come down into it,

17. to take any thing out of his house;

18. nor let him that is in the field return back to take his clothes.

19. But wo to them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days.

20. Pray that your flight be not in the winter, nor on the sabbath:

21. for there shall be then great affliction, such as has not been from the beginning of the world unto this time, no, nor ever shall be.

22. And unless those days be shortened, no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days shall be shortened.

23. Then if any shall say to you, Behold here is the Messiah, or there; believe it not:

24. for there shall rise up false Christs, and false prophets, who shall shew great signs and prodigies, so as to deceive, if possible, even the elect.

25. Lo, I have told you before-hand: and therefore if they say to you,

26. Behold, he is in the desert, go not out: behold, he is the secret chambers, believe them not:

27. for as the lightning cometh from the east, and flashes in an instant even to the west, so shall be the coming of the Son of man.

28. For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.

29. And immediately after the affliction of those days, the fun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give it's light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:

30. and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven, and then shall all the tribes of the land mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming as on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory:

31. and He will send forth his messengers with a trumpet of a loud voice, and they shall gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.

32. Now learn a parable from the fig-tree: when it's branch is tender and bringeth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh;

33. so ye also, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near even at the doors.

34. Verily I tell you, this generation shall not pass away, till all these be fulfilled.

35. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.

36. But of THAT day and hour knoweth no one, not even the angels of heaven, but my Father only:

37. for as the days of Noah were, so shall be also the coming of the Son of man;

38. for as in the days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, till the day that Noah entered into the ark,

39. and knew not of it till the deluge came and took them all away; so shall be also the coming of the Son of man.

40. Then there shall be two in the field, the one shall be taken and the other left:

41. and two women grinding at the mill, one taken and one left.

42. Watch therefore, for ye know not at what hour your Lord cometh:

43. but this ye know, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broke open: therefore be ye also ready;

44. for the Son of man cometh at a time that ye think not of.

45. Who then is the faithful and prudent servant, whom his lord hath set over his family to give them food in due season?

46. blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so employed:

47. verily I tell you, that he will set him over his whole estate.

48. But if that servant be wicked and say in his heart, my master delayeth his coming,

49. and begin to beat his fellow-servants, and to revel with drunkards:

50. the lord of that servant will come in a day when he doth not expect him, and in an hour which he knows not,

51. and will cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with hypocrites: where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 

## Matthew 25

1. Then will the kingdom of heaven be like ten virgins, who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom: and five of them were wise,

2. and five were foolish.

3. The foolish ones took their lamps, and took no oil with them:

4. but the wise took oil in their vessels as well as in their lamps.

5. Now while the bridegroom stayed, they were all drowsy and fell asleep:

6. and in the middle of the night there was a cry, The bridegroom is coming, go out to meet him.

7. Then all the virgins rose up and trimmed their lamps:

8. and the foolish ones said to the wise, Give us of your oil, for our lamps are going out:

9. but the wise answered them, saying, Least there should not be enough for us and you, go rather to them that sell it, and buy for yourselves.

10. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and they that were ready went in with him to the wedding-feast, and then the door was shut.

11. Afterwards came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us:

12. but he answered them, Verily I declare unto you, I do not know you.

13. Watch therefore, for ye know not the day, nor the season in which the Son of man cometh.

14. For as a man, who was going to travel abroad, called his servants, and delivered to them his stock: and to one he gave five talents,

15. to another two, and to another one; to each according to his ability: and then he took his journey.

16. Now he that had received the five talents, went and traded with them, and gained other five talents:

17. and likewise he that had the two, he also gained two more:

18. but he who had received the one, went and digged in the earth, and hid his master's money:

19. and after some time the lord of those servants cometh and settleth his account with them.

20. And he who had received the five talents came and brought to him five talents more, saying, Sir, thou deliveredst to me five talents, behold I have gained other five talents to them:

21. and his lord said to him, Well done, my good and trusty servant, thou hast been faithful in a few things, I will set thee over many, enter into thy master's joy.

22. And he also who had received the two talents came to him and said, Lord, thou deliveredst to me two talents, behold I have gained two other talents with them:

23. his lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant, thou hast been faithful in a few things, I will set thee over many, enter into the joy of thy lord.

24. And he also who received the one talent came to him and said, Sir, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou sowedst not, and gathering where thou hast not strewed;

25. and I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the ground; behold, there is thine own:

26. but his lord answered and said to him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strewed;

27. thou oughtest then to have put my money to the bankers, and when I came I should have received my own with interest.

28. Take ye therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that hath the ten talents;

29. (for to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound; but from him that hath not, even what he hath, or seemeth to have, shall be taken away:)

30. and cast out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

31. So when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon his glorious throne:

32. and all nations shall be assembled before Him; and He shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides the sheep from the goats:

33. and He shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.

34. Then will the king say to them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:

35. for I was famishing, and ye gave me food; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in;

36. I was naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye took care of me; I was in prison, and ye visited me.

37. Then will the righteous answer Him, saying, Lord, when did we see thee hungry, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?

38. and when did we see thee a stranger, and took thee in?

39. or naked, and clothed thee? and when did we see thee sick, or in prison, and visited thee?

40. And the king replying will say unto them, Verily I declare unto you, inasmuch as ye did it to one of the lest of these my brethren, ye did it to me.

41. Then will He say also to those on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:

42. for I was famishing, and ye gave me nothing to eat; I was a-thirst, and ye gave me no drink;

43. I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye took no care of me.

44. Then will they also answer Him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee famishing, or a-thirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not relieve thee?

45. Then will He reply to them, saying, Verily I tell you, inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the lest of these, ye did it not to me.

46. And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life everlasting. 

## Matthew 26

1. And when Jesus had finished these discourses, He said to his disciples,

2. Ye know that after two days the passover is to be kept,---and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.

3. Now the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people were then assembled together into the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas:

4. and were consulting how they might take Jesus by treachery and put Him to death.

5. But they said, Not on the feast-day, least there should be a tumult among the people.

6. And when Jesus was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,

7. there came to Him a woman with an alabaster-box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head as He was at table:

8. but when his disciples saw it, they were some of them provoked at it, and said, Wherefore is this waste?

9. for this ointment might have been sold for a great deal of money, and given to the poor.

10. But Jesus, knowing what passed, said to them, Why do ye give the woman uneasiness? for she has done a good office to me:

11. (seeing ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always:) for in pouring this ointment on my body,

12. she has embalmed me for my burial.

13. Verily I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached, in the whole world, what she hath done shall also be spoken of for a memorial of her.

14. About this time went one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot,

15. to the chief priests, and said, What will ye give me, and I will deliver Him to you? and they promised him thirty pieces of silver:

16. and from that time he sought opportunity to betray Him.

17. Now upon the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, came the disciples to Jesus, saying, where wouldest thou have us make preparation for thee to eat the passover?

18. And He said, Go into the city, to such a man, and tell him, The master saith, my time is near, I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples: and the disciples did as Jesus ordered them,

19. and prepared the passover.

20. And when the evening was come, He sat down with the twelve:

21. and as they were eating, He said, Verily I tell you, that one of you will betray me.

22. And they were exceedingly grieved, and said to Him, every one of them, Lord, is it I?

23. and He answered, he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, even he will betray me.

24. The Son of man is going indeed as it is written concerning Him: but wo to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed; it had been good for him, if that man had never been born.

25. And Judas, who betrayed Him, answered and said, Master, is it I? and He said unto him, It is.

26. Now as they were at table, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body:

27. and He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it:

28. for this is my blood, the blood of the new covenant, which is to be shed for many for the remission of sins:

29. but I tell you, that from henceforth I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.

30. And when they had sung an hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.

31. Then saith Jesus unto them, Ye will all take offence at me this night; for it is written, "I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered:"

32. but after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.

33. But Peter answered and said to Him, though they should all be offended in thee, yet will I never be offended.

34. Jesus said unto him, Verily I tell thee that this night, before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice.

35. Peter replied, though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. And so likewise said all the disciples.

36. Then went Jesus with them to a place called Gethsemane, and saith to the disciples, Sit here, while I go there and pray:

37. and having taken with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, He began to be sorrowful and much distressed;

38. and saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death, stay here and watch with me.

39. And going a little farther, He prostrated himself, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.

40. And coming to the disciples, he findeth them asleep, and saith to Peter, what! could ye not watch with me one hour?

41. Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.

42. And going away again, the second time He prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass from me, unless I drink it, thy will be done.

43. And He came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy.

44. And He left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, to the same effect.

45. Then He cometh to his disciples and saith, Are ye sleeping still and taking your rest? behold, the hour is come, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

46. Rise, let us go, see the traitor is at hand.

47. And while He was yet speaking, behold, Judas one of the twelve came, and with him a great number, with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people:

48. (now he that betrayed Him, had given them a signal, saying, The man whom I shall kiss is He, lay hold of Him:)

49. and going directly up to Jesus, he said, Hail master, and kissed Him.

50. And Jesus said to him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? then they came up and laid hands on Jesus, and apprehended Him.

51. And one of them that were with Jesus, stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and striking at the high priest's servant took off his ear.

52. Then said Jesus to him, Put up thy sword into it's place; for they that take the sword shall perish by the sword:

53. dost thou think that I cannot now apply to my Father, and He will send me more than twelve legions of angels?

54. but how then should the scriptures be fulfilled, which say that thus it must be?

55. Then said Jesus to the multitudes, Ye are come out as against a thief with swords and clubs to take me, whereas I sat with you day after day teaching in the temple, and ye did not seize me: but all this is done,

56. that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.

57. Then all the disciples deserted Him and fled. And they, that apprehended Jesus, led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled:

58. and Peter followed Him at a distance, to the high-priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, that he might see the issue.

59. Now the chief priests and elders, and the whole council sought false-witness against Jesus, that they might put Him to death: but found none.

60. And tho' many false witnesses came, they found none to their purpose. But at last came two false witnesses and said,

61. This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.

62. And the high priest stood up and said to Him, Dost thou make no answer? what do these men testify against thee? but Jesus made no reply.

63. Then the high priest said to Him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us, if thou be the Christ, the Son of God.

64. Jesus saith unto him, It is as thou hast said: and I tell you, hereafter ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.

65. Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy, what need have we more of witnesses? now ye have heard his blasphemy, what think ye?

66. and they answered, He ought to be put to death.

67. Then did they spit in his face, and beat Him about the head; and some struck Him with rods,

68. saying, Divine to us, thou Christ, who it is that smote thee.

69. Now Peter was sitting without in the hall, and one of the maids came to him and said, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee:

70. but he denied it before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.

71. And he went out into the porch; after which another maid saw him, and said to them that were there, This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth:

72. and he denied a second time, and that with an oath, saying, I know not the man. And a little after, they that stood by came to Peter and said,

73. Verily thou also art one of them, for thy speech discovers thee:

74. then he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.

75. And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who had said to him, before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly. 

## Matthew 27

1. And as soon as it was morning all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, how to get Him executed:

2. so they bound Him and led Him away, and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the Roman governor.

3. Then Judas, who had betrayed Him, when he saw that He was condemned, being struck with remorse, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,

4. saying, I have sinned, for I have betrayed innocent blood: but they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.

5. And he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.

6. But the chief priests took up the pieces of silver, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury of the temple, because it is the price of blood:

7. so they consulted together, and bought with them the potter's field for a burying-ground for strangers:

8. and therefore that field is called the field of blood to this day.

9. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was estimated, on whom the children of Israel set the price,

10. and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.

11. And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked Him, saying, Art thou the king of the Jews? And Jesus answered him, It is as thou sayest.

12. And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing.

13. Then saith Pilate to Him, Dost thou not hear how many things they witness against thee?

14. but He answered him not one word: so that the governor was much astonished.

15. Now the governor used at the feast to release a prisoner to the people, whomsoever they desired:

16. and they had then a notorious malefactor named Barabbas.

17. Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you?

18. Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ? for he knew that out of envy they had delivered Him up.

19. (And while he was sitting on the tribunal, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that righteous man: for I have suffered much in a dream to day on his account.)

20. But the chief priests and elders persuaded the common people to ask for Barabbas, and so to destroy Jesus.

21. And the governor said to them, Which of the two would you have me release to you? and they said, Barabbas.

22. What shall I do then, saith Pilate, with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all cried out, Let Him be crucified.

23. And the governor said, Why, what evil hath He done? but they cried out the more, saying, Let Him be crucified.

24. Pilate seeing that he prevailed nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just man, look ye to it:

25. and all the people answered and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.

26. Then he released to them Barabbas: but he ordered Jesus to be scourged, and delivered Him to be crucified.

27. Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the hall, and gathered the whole band about Him:

28. and when they had stript Him, they covered Him with a scarlet robe;

29. and having platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they bowed the knee before Him in derision, saying, Hail king of the Jews:

30. and they spit upon Him, and took the reed and struck Him on the head.

31. And after they had thus abused Him, they took off the scarlet robe from Him, and put on Him his own clothes, and led Him away to be crucified.

32. And as they were going along they met with a man of Cyrene, whose name was Simon; and forced him to carry the cross.

33. And when they were come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say,

34. the place of a skull, they gave Him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: but when He had tasted it, He would not drink.

35. And after they had fixed Him to the cross, they parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.

36. And they sat down and watched Him there: and put up over his head his accusation in writing,

37. THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

38. And there were two thieves crucified with Him: one on his right hand, and one on the left.

39. And they that passed by reviled Him, shaking their heads,

40. and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it again in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross.

41. And in like manner the chief priests also insulting Him, with the scribes and elders,

42. said, He saved others, himself He cannot save: if He be the king of Israel, let Him come down now from the cross, and we will believe Him:

43. He trusted in God, let Him deliver Him now, if He will own Him; for He said, I am the Son of God.

44. And one of the thieves also, that were crucified with Him, cast the same reproach upon Him.

45. Now from the sixth hour to the ninth there was darkness over all the land.

46. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani," that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

47. And some of them that stood by, hearing Him, said, He calls upon Elias:

48. and immediately one of them ran, and took a spunge, and having filled it with vinegar put it upon a reed, and offered it Him to drink;

49. the rest said, Stay, let us see whether Elias will come and save Him.

50. But Jesus cried out again with a loud voice; and then gave up the ghost.

51. And behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom, and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were split:

52. and the graves opened, and many bodies of departed saints arose,

53. and coming out of the graves, after his resurrection, went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.

54. And when the centurion, and they that were with him guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake, and what was done, they were sore afraid, and said, This was indeed the Son of God.

55. And several women were there looking on at a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministring unto Him:

56. among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.

57. And in the evening, there came a rich man of Arimathea, whose name was Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus, and went to Pilate,

58. and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered the body to be delivered to him;

59. and Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,

60. and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had had cut out in the rock; and when he had rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, he went away:

61. but there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary sitting over against the sepulchre.

62. Now the next day after the preparation, the chief priests and pharisees went together to Pilate, saying, Sir, we remember that this impostor,

63. when He was alive, said, After three days I will rise again:

64. order therefore the sepulchre to be secured till the third day, least his disciples should come and steal Him away, and tell the people, He is risen from the dead: and so the last error will be worse than the first.

65. But Pilate said to them, Ye have a guard of your own, go and make it as secure as ye will.

66. So they went and made the sepulchre safe, sealing the stone, and setting a guard to watch it. 

## Matthew 28

1. Now after the sabbath, in the dawning towards the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, to look at the sepulchre:

2. and behold, there had been a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descending from heaven, had come and rolled away the stone from the door, and was sitting upon it:

3. (and his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:

4. and the guards shook for fear of him, and became like dead men:)

5. and the angel said to the women, Be not ye afraid: for I know that ye seek Jesus who was crucified.

6. He is not here, for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay:

7. and go quickly, and tell his disciples that He is risen from the dead; and behold, He is going before you into Galilee; there ye shall see Him; lo, I have told you.

8. And they went immediately from the sepulchre, with fear, and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.

9. And as they were going to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them and said, God save you. And they drew near and embraced his feet, and worshipped Him.

10. Then saith Jesus unto them, Be not afraid, go tell my brethren to repair into Galilee, and there they shall see me.

11. Now while they were going, behold some of the guard came into the city, and told the chief priests all that had happened:

12. and they assembled with the elders, and taking counsel together gave the soldiers a large sum of money,

13. saying, Do you say, that his disciples came by night, and stole Him away, while we were asleep.

14. And if this should come to a hearing before the governor, we will satisfy him, and indemnify you.

15. So they took the money, and did as they were instructed: and this is commonly reported among the Jews to this day.

16. And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.

17. And when they saw Him, they worshipped Him: but some doubted.

18. And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me both in heaven and on earth.

19. Go ye therefore and instruct all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son,

20. and of the holy Ghost, and teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world. Amen.
