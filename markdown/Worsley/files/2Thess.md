# 2 Thessalonians

## 2 Thessalonians 1

1. Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ;

2. grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

3. We ought always to give thanks to God on your account, my brethren, as it is fit; because your faith increaseth greatly, and the love of every one of you towards each other aboundeth:

4. so that we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God, for your patience and faith under all your persecutions and afflictions which ye endure.

5. Which are a demonstration of the just judgement of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:

6. seeing it is a righteous thing with God to render affliction to those that afflict you;

7. and to you, who are in trouble, rest with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven,

8. with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on those who know not God, and who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:

9. who shall be punished with everlasting destruction, by the presence of the Lord and by his glorious power:

10. in that day, when He shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe; because our testimony among you was believed.

11. Wherefore we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:

12. that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in Him, according to the grace of our God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

## 2 Thessalonians 2

1. But as to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto Him,

2. we beseech you, brethren, that ye be not soon moved from your steadiness of mind, or troubled, neither by Spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as from us, that the day of Christ is at hand.

3. Let not any one deceive you by any means; for it shall not come till there come an apostasy first, and the man of sin be revealed,

4. the son of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or the object of worship; so that he sits as God in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.

5. Do ye not remember, that when I was with you, I told you these things?

6. And ye know what now hindereth him from being revealed in his own time.

7. For the mystery of iniquity is already working, only there is one that hindreth till he be taken out of the way.

8. And then the wicked one shall be detected, whom the Lord will destroy by the breath of his mouth, and abolish by the brightness of his coming:

9. who comes, through the efficacy of Satan, with all kind of lying power, and signs,

10. and wonders, and with all iniquitous fraud, among those that shall perish; because they received not the love of the truth, by which they might be saved.

11. And for this cause God will send upon them the efficacy of error, so that they shall themselves believe the lie:

12. that they may all be condemned, who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in iniquity.

13. But we ought always to give thanks to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord; because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth:

14. to which He hath called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

15. Therefore, brethren, be steady, and hold fast the traditions, which ye have been taught, whether by word or by our letter.

16. And may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and our God and Father, who hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation, and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts,

17. and establish you in every good word and work. 

## 2 Thessalonians 3

1. As for the rest, my brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run, and be glorified, as it is among you:

2. and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for all have not faith.

3. But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you, and preserve you from the evil one.

4. And we trust in the Lord concerning you, that ye both do and will do the things which we give you in charge.

5. And may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.

6. Now we charge you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw yourselves from every brother who walketh disorderly, and not according to the instruction which he received from us.

7. For ye know how ye ought to imitate us: for we were not disorderly among you;

8. neither did we eat any one's bread for nothing; but with labor and toil, working night and day, that we might not be burthensome to any of you.

9. Not that we have not power, but that we might give ourselves as an example to you to imitate us.

10. For when we were with you, we gave you this charge, if any will not work, neither let him eat.

11. For we hear that there are some among you that walk disorderly, doing no work themselves, but very busy in the affairs of others.

12. Such we charge and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that they work quietly and earn their own bread.

13. But be not you, my brethren, discouraged from well-doing. And if any obey not our order,

14. by this epistle, mark such a one, and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed.

15. However do not look upon him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.

16. Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in all places. The Lord be with you all.

17. The salutation of me Paul by my own hand, which is the token in every epistle; for so I write,

18. "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all." Amen.
