## 2 John 1

1. The elder unto the excellent Lady, and her children, whom I love in truth: and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;

2. for the sake of the truth which dwelleth in us, and will be with us for ever:

3. grace, mercy, and peace be with you from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.

4. I rejoiced greatly that I found among thy children such as walked in truth, as we received commandment from the Father.

5. And now I beseech thee, Lady, not as writing to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we may love one another.

6. And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, as ye heard from the beginning, that ye should walk in it.

7. For many deceivers are come out into the world, who disown that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. Such a one is a deceiver and an antichrist.

8. Look to yourselves, that ye lose not the things which ye have wrought, but that ye may receive a full reward.

9. Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God: but he, that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, hath both the Father and the Son.

10. Now if any one come unto you, and bringeth not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, nor wish him success: for he,

11. that biddeth him welcome, is partaker of his evil deeds.

12. Having many things to write unto you, I would not with paper and ink: but I hope to come unto you, and speak mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full.

13. The children of thy elect sister salute thee. Amen.
