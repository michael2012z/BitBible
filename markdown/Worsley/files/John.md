## John 1

1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

2. The same was in the beginning with God.

3. By Him were all things made, and without Him was not any one thing made that was made.

4. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.

5. And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness attained it not.

6. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John:

7. this man came for witness, that he might testify concerning the light, that through him all might believe.

8. He was not that light, but was sent to bear witness of the light.

9. The true light was that which enlightneth every man that cometh into the world.

10. He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and yet the world knew Him not:

11. yea, He came to his own peculiar right, and even his own people received Him not.

12. But as many as received Him, to them granted He the privilege to become the children of God, even to them that believe on his name;

13. who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

14. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, being full of grace and truth: and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father.

15. Of Him did John bare witness, and publicly declared, saying, This was He of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me; for He was before me.

16. And of his fulness have we all received, even grace for grace.

17. For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ:

18. and though no one hath ever seen God, or can see Him: yet the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, hath made Him known.

19. And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, Who art thou?

20. he confessed, and denied not; but declared openly, I am not the Christ.

21. And they asked him, What then? art thou Elias? And he said, I am not. Art thou a prophet? and he answered, No.

22. Therefore said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us: What dost thou say of thy self?

23. and he said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, "Make straight the way of the Lord," according to Esaias the prophet.

24. Now they that were sent, were of the pharisees:

25. and they asked him, and said to him, Why then dost thou baptize, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elias, nor a prophet?

26. John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;

27. that cometh after me, but is preferred before me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.

28. These things passed at Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.

29. The next day John seeth Jesus coming towards him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.

30. This is He of whom I said, After me cometh a man, who is preferred before me: for He was before me.

31. And I knew Him not: but therefore came I baptizing with water, that He might be made known to Israel.

32. And John testified saying, I saw the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven, and it abode upon Him.

33. And I knew Him not: but He that sent me to baptize with water, said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on Him, the same is he that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit.

34. And I saw it, and therefore testified that this is the Son of God.

35. The day following John was standing, (and two of his disciples,)

36. and looking upon Jesus as He was walking, he saith, "Behold the lamb of God."

37. And when the two disciples heard what he said, they followed Jesus.

38. And Jesus turning, and seeing them following Him, saith unto them, What do ye seek? They said unto Him, Rabbi (that is to say, Master,) where is thine abode?

39. He saith unto them, Come and see. And they came and saw where He dwelt, and abode with Him that day: and it was about the tenth hour.

40. Now Andrew the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two that heard what John said, and thereupon followed Jesus.

41. He first meeteth with his own brother Simon, and telleth him, "We have found the Messiah, which is to say, the Christ."

42. And Andrew brought him to Jesus: and Jesus looking at him said, Thou art Simon the son of Jonas, thou shalt be called Cephas; which is interpreted a stone.

43. The day following Jesus had a mind to go out into Galilee, and meeting with Philip, saith unto him, Follow me.

44. Now Philip was of Bethsaida the city of Andrew and Peter.

45. Philip meeting Nathaniel, saith unto him, We have found Him, of whom Moses in the law, and of whom the prophets also wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Jeseph.

46. And Nathaniel said unto him, Can any thing good come out of Nazareth? Philip replied, Come and see.

47. And when Jesus saw Nathaniel coming towards Him, He saith concerning him, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile."

48. Nathaniel saith unto Him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered him, Before Philip called thee, I saw thee, when under the fig-tree.

49. Nathaniel replied, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the king of Israel.

50. Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I told thee that I saw thee under the fig-tree, thou believest: thou shalt see greater things than these.

51. And He saith unto him, Verily verily I say unto you, Ye shall hereafter see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. 

## John 2

1. And on the third day after, there was a marriage at Cana of Galilee: and the mother of Jesus was there.

2. And Jesus and his disciples were invited to the wedding.

3. And the wine falling short, the mother of Jesus saith unto Him, They have no wine.

4. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? my time is not yet come.

5. His mother saith to the servants, Whatsoever he ordereth you to do, do it.

6. And there were six stone waterpots, placed according to the custom of purifying among the Jews, containing each about two or three firkins.

7. Jesus saith unto them, Fill the water-pots with water: and they filled them up to the brim.

8. And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and carry it to the master of the feast. And they carried it to him.

9. And when the manager of the feast had tasted the water which was made wine, and knew not whence it was, (but the servants, that drew the water, knew,) he called the bride-groom,

10. and saith unto him, Every man sets out good wine at first, and when they have drank plentifully, then that which is worse; but thou hast keep the good wine till now.

11. This beginning of his miracles Jesus wrought at Cana of Galilee, and made manifest his glory: and his disciples believed on Him.

12. After this He went down to Capernaum, He and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: but they staid there not many days.

13. For the passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. And He found in the temple those that sold oxen,

14. and sheep, and doves, and the money changers sitting:

15. and having made a whip of small cords He drove them all, out of the temple; with the sheep and the oxen: and He poured out the changers money, and threw down the tables.

16. And said to them that sold doves, Take away these things from hence, and make not my Father's house an house of traffick.

17. And his disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.

18. The Jews therefore answered and said unto Him, What sign dost thou shew us, seeing thou dost these things?

19. Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again: then said the Jews,

20. Forty and six years has this temple been in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days? but He spake of the temple of his body.

21. Therefore when he was risen from the dead,

22. his disciples remembered, that He had said this to them: and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.

23. And when he was in Jerusalem at the passover on the feast-day, many believed in his name, seeing his miracles, which He wrought.

24. But Jesus did not trust Himself to them;

25. for He knew all men, and He had no need that any should testify concerning man; for He knew what was in man. 

## John 3

1. Now there was a man of the pharisees, whose name was Nicodemus, a ruler among the Jews:

2. who came to Jesus by night, and said unto Him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for none can do these miracles which thou dost, unless God be with him.

3. Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily verily I tell thee, Unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

4. Nicodemus saith unto Him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?

5. Jesus answered, I tell thee of a truth, Unless a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

6. That, which is born of the flesh, is flesh; and that, which is born of the Spirit, is spirit.

7. Do not wonder that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.

8. As the wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound of it, but knowest not whence it cometh, or whither it goeth; so is every one that is born of the Spirit.

9. Nicodemus answered and said unto Him, How can these things be?

10. Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a teacher of Israel and knowest not these things?

11. I assure thee, that we speak what we know, and testify what we have seen; though ye receive not our testimony.

12. If I have told you earthly things and ye believe not, how will ye believe if I should tell you heavenly ones?

13. For no one hath ascended up into heaven, but He that came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven.

14. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up:

15. that whosoever believeth on Him may not perish, but have eternal life.

16. For God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on Him might not perish, but have everlasting life:

17. for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved by Him.

18. He that believeth on Him is not condemned: but he that believeth not, is already condemned; because he hath not believed on the name of the only-begotten Son of God.

19. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.

20. For every one that doth evil, hateth the light; and he cometh not to the light, least his deeds should be reproved.

21. But he that acts according to truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

22. After these things came Jesus, and his disciples into the land of Judea: and He stayed with them there, and baptized.

23. And John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim; because there was much water there: and people came to him and were baptized.

24. For John was not yet cast into prison.

25. Now there arose a dispute between some of the disciples of John, and the Jews, about purifying.

26. And they came to John, and said unto him, Rabbi, He that was with thee on the other side Jordan, to whom thou barest testimony, behold, He baptizeth and all the people come to Him.

27. John answered and said, A man can take nothing upon him, unless it be given him from heaven.

28. Ye your selves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but am sent before Him.

29. He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth with great joy at the bridegroom's voice. Therefore my joy is complete.

30. He must increase, but I must decrease.

31. He, that cometh from above, is above all: he that is of the earth, is earthly, and talketh like one of the earth:

32. but He that cometh from heaven, is above all: and what He hath seen and heard, this He testifieth: and yet scarce any one receiveth his testimony.

33. He that hath received his testimony, hath set his seal to this, that God is true:

34. for He, whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God: for God giveth the Spirit to Him not by measure.

35. The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all into his hand:

36. wherefore he that believeth on the Son, hath eternal life; and he that obeyeth not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. 

## John 4

1. Therefore when the Lord knew, the pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,

2. (though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but his disciples,)

3. He left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.

4. And as He must pass through the country of Samaria, He came to a Samaritan city called Sichar,

5. near the piece of ground which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

6. And Jacob's well was there. Now Jesus was tired with his journey, and sat down at the well: and it was about the sixth hour of the day,

7. when a woman of Samaria coming to draw water, Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.

8. (For his disciples were gone away to the city to buy food.)

9. But the Samaritan saith unto Him, How is it that thou who art a Jew askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan? for the Jews have no friendly intercourse with the Samaritans.

10. Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith unto thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldst have asked of Him, and He would have given thee living water.

11. The woman saith unto Him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou the living water?

12. Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his children, and his cattle?

13. Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water, will thirst again;

14. but he that drinketh of the water which I shall give him, shall never thirst: but the water, which I shall give him, will be in him a fountain of water springing up unto eternal life.

15. The woman saith unto Him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.

16. Jesus saith unto her, Go call thine husband, and come hither.

17. The woman answered, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou hast said right, I have no husband:

18. for thou hast had five husbands; and he, whom thou now hast, is not thy husband: this thou hast said true.

19. The woman saith unto Him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.

20. Our fathers worshipped on this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.

21. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the time is coming, when ye shall worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.

22. Ye worship ye know not what; but we worship what we know: for salvation is from the Jews.

23. But the time is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for the Father requireth such worshippers of Him.

24. God is a spirit, and they that worship Him, must worship in spirit and truth.

25. Then saith the woman unto Him, I know that the Messiah, that is to say the Christ, is coming; and when He comes, He will tell us all things.

26. Jesus saith unto her, I, who am talking to thee, am He.

27. And upon this came his disciples and wondered that He talked with the woman: (though none of them said, What dost thou seek? or, Why dost thou talk with her?)

28. therefore the woman left her water-pot, and went away into the city,

29. and saith to the people, Come, see a man who hath told me all that ever I did; is not this the Christ?

30. They therefore went out of the city, and came to Him.

31. In the mean time his disciples addressed Him, saying, Master, eat.

32. But He said unto them, I have food to eat, which ye know not of.

33. Therefore the disciples said one to another, Hath any one brought Him aught to eat?

34. Jesus saith unto them, My food is to do the will of Him that sent me, and to finish his work.

35. Do not ye say, it is yet four months, and then cometh harvest? Behold, lift up your eyes, and see the fields, they are already white for harvest.

36. And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth the fruit together unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together;

37. for herein the saying is verified, that one soweth, and another reapeth,

38. in as much as I have sent you to reap that on which ye have not laboured: others have laboured, and ye are entered into their labors.

39. And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on Him, because of what the woman said, testifying, He told me all that ever I did.

40. Therefore when the Samaritans came to Him, they desired Him to stay with them: and He staid there two days.

41. And many more believed on account of his own discourse:

42. and said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of what thou hast spoken; for we ourselves have heard Him, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.

43. And after two days he departed thence, and went into Cana of Galilee.

44. For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.

45. And when He was come into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went to the feast.

46. Therefore Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where He had made the water wine.

47. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum: who, when he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee, went to Him, and intreated Him, that he would come down and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.

48. Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe.

49. The nobleman saith unto Him, Lord, come down before my child die.

50. Jesus saith unto him, Go, thy son is well. And the man believed what Jesus said unto him, and went his way.

51. And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told him, saying, Thy son is well.

52. He inquired therefore of them the hour in which he grew better: and they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.

53. So the father knew that it was in that same hour, in which Jesus said to him, Thy son is well. And he and his whole family believed.

54. This is the second miracle that Jesus wrought, upon coming out of Judea into Galilee. 

## John 5

1. After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

2. Now there is at Jerusalem near the sheep-market a pool, called in Hebrew Bethesda, with five porticos about it.

3. In these lay a great number of people that were infirm, blind, lame, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.

4. For an angel descended at a certain season into the pool, and moved the water; the first therefore that went in after the disturbing of the water, was cured of whatever malady he laboured under.

5. And there was a man who had been under illness thirty eight years.

6. Jesus seeing him lie there, and knowing that he had been now a long time ill, saith unto him, Dost thou desire to be cured?

7. The infirm man answered Him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is moved, to put me into the pool; but while I am coming, another goes down before me.

8. Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.

9. And immediately the man was cured: and he took up his bed and walked.

10. Now this was the sabbath-day, therefore the Jews said to him that was cured, It is the sabbath, it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.

11. He answered them, He, that made me well, said unto me, Take up thy bed and walk.

12. Therefore they asked him, Who is the man that said to thee, Take up thy bed and walk?

13. but he, that was healed, did not know who it was: for Jesus had withdrawn himself, there being many people in the place.

14. Afterwards Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou art healed; sin no more, least something worse befal thee.

15. And the man went away, and told the Jews, that it was Jesus who had healed him.

16. And for this did the Jews persecute Jesus, and endeavoured to put Him to death; because He had done these things on the sabbath-day.

17. But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh without intermission, and so do I.

18. For this therefore the Jews sought the more to kill Him, because He had not only broken the sabbath, but had also called God his own Father, making Himself equal with God.

19. Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Verily, verily I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do: for whatsoever He doth, these also the Son doth in like manner.

20. For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth Him all things, which He Himself doth: and He will shew Him greater than these, that ye may wonder.

21. For as the Father raiseth up the dead and giveth life: even so the Son maketh alive whom He pleaseth.

22. For neither doth the Father judge any one, but hath committed all judgement to the Son;

23. that all men may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father: he, that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father that sent Him.

24. Verily, verily I say unto you, he, that heareth my word, and believeth in Him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come under condemnation; but is passed from death to life.

25. Verily, verily I tell you, that the time is coming, and even now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.

26. For as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given also to the Son to have life in Himself.

27. And hath given Him authority also to execute judgement, because He is the Son of man.

28. Wonder not at this; for the time is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,

29. and shall come forth, they that have done good to the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil to the resurrection of damnation.

30. I can do nothing of my self: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father that hath sent me.

31. If I alone bear witness of my self, my testimony is not true in law:

32. but there is another who testifieth concerning me; and I know that the testimony, which he giveth concerning me, is true.

33. Ye your selves sent unto John, and he bore witness to the truth:

34. though I need not testimony from man; but I say these things that ye may be saved.

35. He was indeed a burning and shining light, and for a while ye willingly rejoiced in his light.

36. But I have a testimony greater than John's: for the works which the Father hath given me to perform, the very works which I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.

37. And the Father who sent me, hath Himself borne witness of me: and yet ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.

38. And ye have not his word abiding in you; because ye believe not Him, whom He hath sent.

39. Ye search the scriptures; for ye think that in them ye have eternal life:

40. and they testify of me: and yet ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.

41. Though I desire not applause from men:

42. but I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.

43. I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another should come in his own name, him ye will receive.

44. How can ye believe, who receive applause from each other, and the glory which is from God only, ye seek not?

45. Think not that I shall accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.

46. For if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote concerning me:

47. but if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words? 

## John 6

1. After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.

2. And a great multitude followed Him, because they saw his miracles which He performed on them that were diseased.

3. So Jesus went up to a mountain, and there He sat down with his disciples.

4. And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.

5. Then Jesus lifted up his eyes, and seeing a great multitude come to Him, saith to Philip, Whence shall we buy bread that these people may eat?

6. (and this He said to try him, for He knew what He was going to do:)

7. Philip answered Him, Two hundred penny-worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one may take a little.

8. One of his disciples, to wit, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter,

9. saith unto Him, There is a lad here, that hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes; but what are they among so many?

10. And Jesus said, Make the men sit down: (now there was much grass in the place:) so the men sat down in number about five thousand.

11. And Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks, He distributed them to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were sat down; and of the fishes likewise, as much as they would take.

12. And when they were filled, He saith to his disciples, Gather up the fragments that are left, that nothing may be lost.

13. They therefore gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley-loaves, which remained after they had eaten.

14. Therefore the people when they had seen the miracle that Jesus wrought, said, this is certainly the Prophet who was to come into the world.

15. Jesus therefore knowing that they would come, and take Him by force if possible, to make Him king, retired again to the mountain Himself alone.

16. And when evening was come, his disciples went down to the sea:

17. and having entered into a ship were going over the Sea towards Capernaum: and it was now dark, and Jesus was not yet come to them.

18. And the sea rose high by reason of a violent wind.

19. So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and near the ship: and they were affrighted.

20. But He saith unto them, It is I: be not afraid.

21. They desired therefore to take Him into the ship: and immediately the vessel was at the land to which they were going.

22. The day following the people that staid on the other side of the sea, seeing there was no other boat there, but that one into which his disciples embarked, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples went away alone:

23. though there came other vessels from Tiberias, near the place where they had eaten bread after the Lord had given thanks: when therefore the people saw that Jesus was not there,

24. nor his disciples; they also went into those vessels, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.

25. And when they found Him on the other side of the Sea, they said unto Him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?

26. Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.

27. Labour not so much for the meat that perisheth, but rather for that food which endureth unto life eternal, which the Son of man will give you: for Him hath God the Father sealed.

28. Therefore said they unto Him, What should we do, that we may work the works approved of God?

29. Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him, whom He hath sent.

30. Therefore said they unto Him, What sign dost thou shew, that we may see it, and believe Thee? What work dost thou do?

31. Our fathers did eat manna in the desert, as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.

32. Therefore Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I tell you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven, but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.

33. For the bread of God is that which descendeth from heaven, and giveth life to the world.

34. Therefore said they unto Him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.

35. Then Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.

36. But I have told you, so that ye have seen me, and yet ye do not believe.

37. All that the Father giveth me, will come unto me; and him that cometh to me I will not cast out.

38. For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of Him that sent me.

39. And this is the will of the Father who sent me, that of all that He hath given me, I should lose none, but should raise them up at the last day.

40. And this is the will of Him that sent me, that every one who looketh attentively at the Son, and so believeth on Him, may have eternal life: and I will raise him up at the last day.

41. The Jews then murmured about Him; because He said, I am the bread that came down from heaven.

42. And they said to one another, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we knew? How then does He say, I came down from heaven?

43. Jesus therefore said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.

44. No one can come to me, unless the Father, who hath sent me, draw him, and I will raise him up at the last day.

45. It is written in the prophets, "And they shall all be taught of God." Every one therefore that hath heard and learned from the Father, cometh unto me.

46. Not that any one hath seen the Father, but He who is from God.

47. He hath seen the Father. Verily, verily, I declare unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.

48. I am the bread of life. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead:

49. but this is the bread which cometh down from heaven,

50. that any one may eat thereof and not die.

51. I am the living bread, which came down from heaven: if any one eat of this bread, he shall live for ever. And the bread, that I will give, is my flesh, which I will give up for the life of the world.

52. The Jews therefore cavilled amongst themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?

53. Then said Jesus unto them, I tell you truly, that unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.

54. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.

55. For my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink: he that feedeth on my flesh and drinketh my blood,

56. abideth in me and I in him.

57. As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that feedeth on me he also shall live by me.

58. This is the bread that came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat, and yet are dead. He that eateth this bread shall live for ever.

59. These things He said in the synagogue, when He was teaching in Capernaum.

60. Many therefore of his disciples, when they heard Him, said, This discourse is hard to be understood, who can take it in?

61. But Jesus knowing in Himself, that his disciples were murmuring about it, said unto them, Does this offend you?

62. What then, if ye should see the Son of man ascending up, where He was before?

63. The spirit is the principle of life, the flesh availeth nothing: now the words that I speak unto you are spirit, and therefore life.

64. But there are some of you that believe not: (for Jesus knew from the beginning, who they were that believed not, and who would betray Him:

65. and He said,) therefore I told you, that no one can come unto me except it be given him from my Father.

66. From this time many of his disciples went away, and walked no more with Him.

67. Jesus therefore said to the twelve, Have ye also a mind to go away?

68. Then Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go?

69. Thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe and know that thou art the Messiah, the Son of the living God.

70. Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?

71. Now He spake of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon; for he was about to betray Him, though he was one of the twelve apostles. 

## John 7

1. After these things Jesus resided in Galilee: for He would not appear in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill Him.

2. Now the Jews feast called the feast of tabernacles was near;

3. his brethren therefore said, Depart from hence, and go into Judea, that thy disciples there also may see the works which thou performest.

4. For no man doth any thing in secret, who is himself desirous to be known in public. As thou dost these wonderful things, make thyself known to the world.

5. For neither did his brethren believe in Him.

6. Then saith Jesus unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always alike ready; for the world cannot hate you:

7. but me it hates, because I bear my testimony concerning it, that it's deeds are evil.

8. Go ye up to this feast as soon as ye please; for I am not yet going up to it, because my time is not yet fully come.

9. And after He had said these things unto them, He stayed a while in Galilee.

10. But when his brethren were gone up, then He also went up to the feast, not in a public manner but as it were in private.

11. The Jews therefore sought for Him at the feast, and said, Where is He?

12. And there was much murmuring among the people concerning Him: for some said, He is a good man; others said, No: He deceiveth the people.

13. No one however spake openly in favor of Him, for fear of the Jews.

14. But when it was now about the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.

15. And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, who never learnt?

16. Jesus answered them and said, The doctrine that I teach is not mine, but his that sent me.

17. If any man desire to do his will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.

18. He, that speaketh from himself, seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of Him that sent him is true, and there is no imposture in him.

19. Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you observeth the law? wherefore else do ye seek to kill me?

20. The people answered and said, Thou art possessed by a demon: who seeketh to kill thee?

21. Jesus answered and said unto them, I performed one miracle on the sabbath, and ye are all amazed at it.

22. Now Moses gave you the law of circumcision, (not that it is originally from Moses, but from the patriarchs,) and ye circumcise even on the sabbath:

23. if then a man receive circumcision on the sabbath-day, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye angry with me, because I made a man perfectly well on the sabbath-day?

24. Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgement.

25. Therefore some of those of Jerusalem said, Is not this He whom they seek to put to death?

26. and here He talketh openly, and they say nothing to Him: Do the rulers indeed know, that this is in truth the Messiah?

27. But we know whence this man is; whereas when Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence He is.

28. Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, ye say, and ye know whence I am: now I am not come of myself, but He that sent me is true, whom ye know not.

29. But I know Him, for I am from Him, and He hath sent me.

30. They sought therefore to seize Him, but no one laid hand on Him, because his hour was not yet come.

31. And many of the people believed on Him, and said, When the Messiah cometh, will He do more miracles than this man hath done?

32. Now the pharisees heard the people murmuring these things concerning Him: and they, with the chief priests, sent officers to seize Him.

33. Therefore Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while I am to be among you, and then I shall go to Him that sent me.

34. Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am to be, ye cannot come.

35. Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will He go, that we shall not find Him? will He go to them that are dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?

36. What is the meaning of this speech, that He said, "Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am to be, ye cannot come?"

37. And on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If any one thirst, let him come unto me and drink.

38. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, rivers of living water shall flow from within him.

39. (This He spake of the Spirit, which they that believe on Him should receive; for the holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.)

40. Many of the people therefore, when they heard this discourse, said, This is in truth a prophet.

41. Others said, This is the Messiah. But some said, Shall the Messiah come out of Galilee?

42. Hath not the Scripture said, that Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the town whence David was.

43. So there was a division among the people about Him.

44. And some among them would have seized Him: but no one laid hands on Him.

45. Then came the officers to the chief priests and pharisees, and they said, Why have ye not brought Him? and the officers answered,

46. Never man spake like this man.

47. The pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also deceived?

48. have any of the rulers believed on Him, or of the pharisees?

49. but these people, who know not the law, are cursed.

50. Upon this Nicodemus, (who came to Him by night)

51. being one of them, saith to them, Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he hath done?

52. They replied, Art thou also of Galilee? Search and see: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.

53. And every man went to his own house. 

## John 8

1. But Jesus went to the mount of Olives;

2. and returned early in the morning into the temple, and all the people came to Him: and He sat down, and taught them.

3. And the scribes and pharisees brought to Him a woman taken in adultery;

4. and setting her in the midst, they said to Him, "This woman was caught in the very act, committing adultery.

5. Now Moses in the law has commanded us that such women should be stoned, but what sayest Thou?"

6. This they said to tempt Him, that they might have something to accuse Him of. But Jesus stooping down, wrote with his finger upon the ground.

7. And as they continued asking Him, He raised himself up and said unto them, "Let him that is without sin among you, first cast a stone at her."

8. Then He stooped down again and wrote on the ground.

9. But when they heard his answer, being convicted by their own conscience, they went out one by one, beginning at the elder, even to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst of the people.

10. Then Jesus rising up, and seeing none but the woman, said unto her, Where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?

11. And she said, None, Lord. Then said Jesus unto her, Neither do I condemn thee, Go thy way and sin no more.

12. Then spake Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he, that followeth me, shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.

13. The pharisees therefore said to Him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy testimony is not true.

14. Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear witness of myself, my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I am going; but ye know not whence I come, nor whither I go.

15. Ye judge according to the flesh, but I judge no man as yet:

16. though if I should judge, my judgement is true; for I am not alone, but I am with the Father that sent me.

17. And it is written in your own law, that the testimony of two persons is valid.

18. Now I am one, who bear witness of myself; and the Father, who sent me, beareth witness of me.

19. Then said they unto Him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also.

20. These words spake Jesus in the treasury, when He was teaching in the temple: and no one laid hands on Him, for his hour was not yet come.

21. Jesus therefore said unto them again, "I am going away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: where I go ye cannot come."

22. The Jews therefore said, What! will He kill himself; that He says, where I am going, ye cannot come?

23. And He said unto them, Ye are from beneath, I am from above: ye are of this world, I am not of this world.

24. Therefore I said unto you, that ye shall die in your sins; for if ye believe not that I am the Messiah, ye shall die in your sins.

25. Then said they to Him, Who art thou? And Jesus answered them, Even the same that I told you at first.

26. I have many things to say and to judge concerning you: but I only say, He that sent me is true, and I declare to the world those things, which I have heard from Him.

27. But they did not know that He spake unto them of the Father.

28. Jesus therefore said unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am He, and that I do nothing of myself, but as my Father hath instructed me, I speak these things.

29. And He that sent me, is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him.

30. As He spake these words many believed on Him.

31. Therefore said Jesus to the Jews that believed on Him, If ye continue in my word, ye are indeed my disciples.

32. And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.

33. They answered Him, We are the seed of Abraham, and never were slaves to any one, how then dost thou say, Ye shall be made free?

34. Jesus answered them, Verily, verily I say unto you, whosoever maketh a practice of sin, is the servant of sin.

35. Now the servant does not continue always in the family: but the Son abideth always.

36. If therefore the Son make you free, ye shall be free indeed.

37. I know that ye are the seed of Abraham, but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.

38. I speak that which I have seen with my Father, and ye do what ye have seen with your father.

39. They answered Him, Abraham is our father, Jesus replied, If ye were the children of Abraham, ye would do the works of Abraham:

40. but now ye seek to kill me, who have told you the truth which I have heard from God: Abraham did not thus.

41. But ye do the works of your father. Then said they unto Him, We are not born of fornication, we have one Father, even God.

42. Jesus said unto them, If God were your father, ye would love me: for I came forth, and do come, from God; neither came I of myself, but He sent me.

43. And why do ye not understand my language, but because ye cannot bear my doctrine?

44. Ye are of your father the devil, and are bent upon doing the lusts of your father: he was a murderer from the beginning, and continued not in the truth: for there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh like himself, for he is a liar, and the father of such.

45. And because I say the truth, ye believe me not. Which of you convicteth me of sin?

46. And if I speak truth, why do ye not believe me?

47. He, that is of God, receiveth the words of God; but ye therefore receive them not, because ye are not of God.

48. The Jews therefore answered and said unto Him. Do we not rightly say, that thou art a Samaritan, and art possessed by a demon?

49. Jesus answered I am not possessed by a demon, but I honour my Father, though ye dishonour me.

50. And I seek not my own glory; there is One that seeketh it, and judgeth.

51. Verily, verily, I say unto you, If any one keep my word, he shall never see death.

52. The Jews therefore said unto Him, Now we are sure that thou art possessed by a demon. Abraham is dead, and the prophets too; and thou sayest, If any one keep my word, he shall never taste of death: art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead?

53. and the prophets are dead: whom dost thou pretend to be?

54. Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honor is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me, of whom ye say that He is your God.

55. And yet ye know him not; but I know Him: and if I should say, That I know Him not, I shall be like you, a liar: but I know Him, and obey his word.

56. Your father Abraham longed to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.

57. Then said the Jews unto Him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?

58. Jesus said unto them, Before Abraham was, I am.

59. Therefore they took up stones to throw at Him. But Jesus concealed Himself, and went out of the temple, through the midst of them, and so passed on. 

## John 9

1. And as Jesus was passing along, He saw a man, who had been blind from his birth.

2. And his disciples asked Him, saying, Master, who sinned? this man or his parents? that he was born blind.

3. Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God might be manifested in him.

4. I must perform the works of Him that sent me, while it is day: the night is coming, when no man can work.

5. But as long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.

6. And when He had said these things, He spit on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,

7. and said to him, Go wash at the pool of Siloam (which signifies Sent.) He went therefore and washed, and came again seeing.

8. And the neighbors, and they that had seen him before, that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat begging?

9. Some said, this is he: and others, It is like him: but he said, I am the man.

10. Therefore they said to him, How were thine eyes opened?

11. He answered and said, A man who is called Jesus, made clay and anointed mine eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash: and I went and washed and received my sight.

12. Then said they unto him, Where is He? he answered, I know not.

13. So they brought him, that had formerly been blind, to the pharisees.

14. Now it was the sabbath-day, when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.

15. Therefore the pharisees also asked him again, how he recovered his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.

16. Then said some of the pharisees, This man is not of God, because He doth not keep the sabbath: but others said, How can a wicked man do such miracles? And there was a division among them.

17. So they asked the blind man again, What sayst thou concerning Him? as He hath opened thine eyes.

18. And he said, He is a prophet. But the Jews did not believe that he had been blind and recovered sight, till they called the parents of him, that had received his sight.

19. And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say, was born blind? how then doth he now see?

20. His parents answered them, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;

21. but how it is that he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age, ask him; he can speak for himself.

22. These things said his parents, because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed, that if any one confessed Him to be Christ, he should be turned out of the synagogue.

23. Therefore his parents said, he is of age, ask him.

24. Then they called a second time for the man that had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: for we know that this man is a great sinner.

25. He answered, and said, Whether He be a sinner, I know not: but one thing I know, that I who was blind, do now see.

26. Then said they to him again, What did he do to thee? how did He open thine eyes?

27. He answered them, I have told you already, and ye would not hear? why would ye now hear it again? have ye also a mind to be his disciples?

28. Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple, but we are the disciples of Moses: we know that God spake to Moses:

29. but as for this man, we know not whence He is.

30. The man answered, and said unto them, Why this is something strange, that ye know not whence He is, and yet He hath opened mine eyes.

31. Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a servant of God, and do his will, him He heareth.

32. From the beginning of the world it was never heard, that any one opened the eyes of a person that was born blind.

33. And if this man were not from God, He could do nothing.

34. They answered, and said unto him, Thou wast wholly born in sins, and dost thou teach us?

35. And they cast him out. Now Jesus heard that they had turned him out of the synagogue; and when He met him, He said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?

36. He answered and said, Who is He, Lord, that I may believe on Him?

37. Jesus said unto him, Thou hast seen Him, and it is He that talketh with thee.

38. And he said, Lord, I believe; and worshipped Him.

39. And Jesus said, I am come into this world to execute judgement; that they who see not, may see; and that they who say they see, may be made blind.

40. And some of the pharisees who were present, heard these words, and said to Him, Are we blind also?

41. Jesus replied, If ye were blind, ye would not have sin: but now ye say, We see; your sin therefore remaineth. 

## John 10

1. Verily, verily I say unto you, He that entreth not into the sheep-fold by the door, but climbeth up some other way, is a thief and a robber.

2. But he that cometh in by the door, is the shepherd of the sheep.

3. To him the porter openeth, and the sheep hear his voice; and He calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.

4. And when he bringeth forth his sheep, he goeth before them: and the sheep follow him; because they know his voice.

5. But they will not follow a stranger, but will flee from him; because they know not the voice of strangers.

6. This parable Jesus spake unto them; but they did not understand what He said to them.

7. Jesus therefore said unto them again, Verily, verily I tell you, that I am the door of the sheep.

8. All that came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not regard them.

9. I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved; and shall go in and out, and find pasture.

10. The thief cometh only to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they may have life, and may have it in perfection.

11. I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep.

12. But the hireling, that is not the true shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf seizeth them, and disperseth the sheep.

13. Now the hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.

14. I am the good shepherd, and I know my own sheep, and am known by them.

15. Even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.

16. And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they will hear my voice; so there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.

17. For this doth the Father love me; because I lay down my life: that I may take it again.

18. None taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment I have received from my Father.

19. There was a division therefore again among the Jews on account of these words.

20. And many of them said, He is a demoniac, and is mad; why do ye hear Him?

21. Others said, These are not the words of a demoniac; can a demon open the eyes of the blind?

22. Now it was the feast of dedication at Jerusalem, and it was winter.

23. And Jesus was walking about the temple, in Solomon's portico.

24. Then the Jews came round Him, and said unto Him, How long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou be the Messiah, tell us plainly.

25. Jesus answered them, I have told you, and ye do not believe me: though the works that I do in the name of my Father, testify of me.

26. But ye believe not; because ye are not of my sheep: for as I said unto you, my sheep hear my voice,

27. and I know them, and they follow me.

28. And I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; nor shall any one force them out of my hand.

29. My Father who gave them to me, is greater than all: and therefore none is able to force them out of my Father's hand.

30. I and the Father are one. Then the Jews again took up stones to stone Him.

31. But Jesus said unto them,

32. Many good works have I shewn you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?

33. The Jews answered Him, saying, We do not go about to stone thee for a good work, but for blasphemy; and because thou being a man makest thyself God.

34. Jesus replied, Is it not written in your law, "I have said, ye are gods?"

35. And if it stiled them gods, to whom the word of God came, (and the scripture cannot be made void,)

36. do ye say of Him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?

37. If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.

38. But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in Him.

39. Therefore they sought again to seize Him; but He escaped out of their hand, and went away again beyond Jordan,

40. to the place where John was at first baptizing, and there He abode.

41. And many resorted to Him, and said, John wrought no miracle, but all that he said concerning this man, was true.

42. And many there believed on Him. 

## John 11

1. Now there was a certain person sick, to wit, Lazarus of Bethany, the town of Mary and Martha her sister.

2. (And it was Mary, that anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)

3. His sisters therefore sent to Him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.

4. But when Jesus heard it, He said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.

5. Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.

6. Therefore when He heard that Lazarus was sick, He stayed indeed two days in the place where He was:

7. and after that He saith to his disciples, Let us go again into Judea.

8. The disciples say unto Him, Master, the Jews very lately attempted to stone thee, and art thou going thither again?

9. Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? if any man walk in the day, he doth not stumble; for he seeth the light of this world:

10. but if any one walk in the night, he stumbleth; because he hath no light.

11. Having thus answered them, He afterwards saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus is asleep; but I am going to awake him.

12. Therefore his disciples said, Lord, if he sleep, he will do well.

13. But Jesus spake of his death; though they thought that He was speaking of the refreshment of sleep.

14. Then Jesus said to them plainly, Lazarus is dead:

15. and I am glad for your sakes, I was not there, that ye may believe: but let us go to him.

16. Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.

17. And when Jesus came, He found that he had been four days in the grave.

18. Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, being but about fifteen furlongs from it:

19. and many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.

20. Therefore Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him: but Mary was sitting in the house.

21. And Martha said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.

22. But I know that even now whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will grant it thee.

23. Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.

24. Martha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.

25. Jesus then told her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth on me, though he were dead, shall live again.

26. And every one that is alive, and believeth in me, shall never die.

27. Dost thou believe this? She saith unto Him, Yes, Lord, I believe that thou art the Messiah, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.

28. And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister, telling her privately, The Master is coming and calleth for thee.

29. As soon as she heard it, she gets up with all speed and comes to Him.

30. For Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in the place where Martha met Him.

31. The Jews therefore that were with her in the house to comfort her, seeing Mary that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She is going to the grave to weep there.

32. Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was and saw Him, fell down at his feet, saying unto Him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.

33. Jesus therefore, when He saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping, that came with her, groaned in spirit and was troubled.

34. And He said, Where have ye laid him?

35. They say unto Him, Lord, come and see: and Jesus wept.

36. The Jews therefore said, Behold, how he loved him!

37. but some of them said, Could not He, who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused also that this man should not have died?

38. Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself, cometh to the sepulchre: which was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.

39. Jesus saith, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the deceased, saith unto Him, Lord, by this time he is offensive; for it is the fourth day.

40. Jesus saith unto her, Did I not tell thee, that if thou believest, thou shalt see the glory of God?

41. So they took away the stone from the place where the corpse was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, Father, I thank Thee, that Thou hast heard me.

42. I knew indeed that Thou always hearest me: but because of the people standing by I say this, that they may believe that Thou hast sent me.

43. And when He had said these things, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.

44. And he that had been dead came forth, having his feet and hands rolled up in grave-cloths: and his face bound about with a napkin. Then Jesus bid them, Loosen him and let him go.

45. Therefore many of the Jews, that came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed on Him.

46. But some of them went to the pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.

47. Therefore the chief priests and the pharisees held a council and said, What are we doing? for this man worketh many miracles.

48. If we suffer Him to go on thus, all the people will believe on Him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our place and nation.

49. But Caiaphas who was one of them, being high-priest that year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all;

50. nor do ye consider, that it is better for us that one man should die for the people, than that the whole nation should perish.

51. This however he spake not of himself, but being high-priest at that time he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation:

52. and not for the Jewish nation only, but that he might also gather together the children of God that are dispersed.

53. From that day therefore they consulted together to put Him to death.

54. Wherefore Jesus appeared no longer publicly among the Jews; but went away from thence into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.

55. Now the passover of the Jews was near; and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country, before the passover, to purify themselves.

56. So they sought for Jesus, and said to one another in the temple, What think ye? that He will not come to the feast?

57. Now both the chief priests and the pharisees had given order, that if any one knew where He was, he should inform them, that they might take Him. 

## John 12

1. Jesus however, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, and whom He raised from the dead.

2. Therefore they made Him a supper there, and Martha waited at table, but Lazarus was one of them that sat down with Him.

3. And Mary taking a pound of ointment of spikenard of great value, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped them with her hair; and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.

4. Therefore said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, who was about to betray Him,

5. Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence and given to the poor?

6. He said this, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the common purse he carried what was put into it.

7. Jesus therefore said, Let her alone, she hath reserved this as for the day of my burial.

8. For the poor ye have always with you, but me ye have not always.

9. And a great number of the Jews understanding that He was there, came not only on account of Jesus, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom He had raised from the dead.

10. Wherefore the chief priests took counsel to put Lazarus also to death.

11. Because on his account many of the Jews went away from them, and believed on Jesus.

12. The next day a great multitude that were come to the feast, hearing that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took branches of palm-trees,

13. and went out to meet Him, and cried, Hosanna! blessed be the king of Israel, who cometh in the name of the Lord.

14. And Jesus having gotten a young ass sat thereon,

15. as it is written, "Fear not, O daughter of Sion, behold thy king cometh sitting on an ass's colt."

16. Now his disciples did not understand these things at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written concerning Him, and that they had done thus unto Him.

17. And the people that were with Him testified, that He called Lazarus out of the grave, and raised him from the dead:

18. and for this reason the people went to meet Him, because they heard that He had done this miracle.

19. The pharisees therefore said among themselves, Do ye not see that ye prevail nothing? Behold, all the world is gone after Him.

20. And among those that came up to worship at the feast there were certain Greeks:

21. that came to Philip who was of Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we have a desire to see Jesus.

22. And Philip cometh and telleth Andrew, and then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.

23. And Jesus answered them saying, The time is come that the Son of man is to be glorified.

24. Though I tell you indeed and in truth, Except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it remaineth alone; but if it die, it produceth much fruit.

25. So he, that loveth his life, shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world, shall preserve it unto life eternal.

26. If any man would serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: and if any one serve me, him will my Father honour.

27. Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I to this hour.

28. Father, glorify thy name. Then came a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.

29. The people therefore that stood by, and heard it, said, That it was thunder: but others said, it was an angel spake to Him.

30. Jesus answered and said, This voice came not for my sake, but for yours.

31. Now is the judgement of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.

32. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, shall draw all men unto me.

33. This He said, signifying what death He should die.

34. The people answered Him, We have heard out of the law, that the Messiah abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, the Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?

35. Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while the light is to be with you; walk while ye have the light, least darkness overtake you; for he that walketh in the dark knoweth not whither he goeth.

36. While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and then went away, and concealed himself from them.

37. But though He had done so many miracles before their eyes, yet they did not believe on Him:

38. so that the word of Esaias the prophet was fulfilled, which he spake, saying, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?

39. And therefore they could not believe; for Esaias had also said,

40. He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they might not see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.

41. These things said Esaias when he saw his glory, and spake concerning Him.

42. There were however many of the chief rulers that believed on Him; but because of the pharisees they did not confess it, lest they should be excommunicated.

43. For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.

44. And Jesus raised his voice, and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me only, but on Him that sent me:

45. and he that beholdeth me, beholdeth Him that sent me.

46. I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me, might not abide in darkness.

47. And if any one hear my words and believe not, I do not condemn him: for I am not now come to condemn the world, but to save the world.

48. He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word, that I have spoken, will condemn him at the last day.

49. For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father, who sent me, gave me a commandment, what I should say and what I should speak.

50. And I know that his commandment is life eternal: the things therefore which I speak, I so speak, as the Father hath directed me. 

## John 13

1. Now before the feast of the passover, (Jesus knowing that his hour was come, when He should pass out of this world unto the Father, as He had loved his own, who were yet in the world, He loved them unto the end:)

2. supper being prepared, (the devil having put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray Him) Jesus,

3. who knew that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that He came from God, and was going to God,

4. riseth from supper, and turneth aside his clothes, and took a towel and tied it about Him;

5. and then pouring water into a bason, began to wash the feet of his disciples, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith He was girded.

6. He cometh therefore to Simon Peter among the rest, who saith unto Him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?

7. Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou dost not now understand, but thou shalt know hereafter.

8. Peter saith to Him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I do not wash thee, thou hast no part with me.

9. Simon Peter saith unto Him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.

10. Jesus saith to him, He that hath been bathing, hath need only to wash his feet, being then clean all over: and thus ye are clean, but not all of you.

11. For He knew who would betray Him; therefore He said, Ye are not all clean.

12. And when He had washed their feet, and taken his clothes about Him, He sat down again, and said to them, Do ye know the intent of what I have been doing to you?

13. Ye call me, Master, and Lord; and ye say well; for so I am.

14. If I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet.

15. For I have given you an example, that ye also should do as I have done to you.

16. Verily, verily I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord, nor is the messenger greater than he that sent him.

17. If ye know these things, happy are ye, if ye do them.

18. I speak not of you all; I know whom I have chosen: but have done it that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me, hath lift up his heel against me.

19. And I tell you now, before it come, that when it comes to pass ye may believe that I am the Messiah.

20. Verily, verily I say unto you, He that receiveth him, whom I shall send, receiveth me: and he that receiveth me, receiveth Him that sent me.

21. Jesus having said these things was troubled in spirit, and He openly testified and said, Verily, verily I tell you, that one of you will betray me.

22. The disciples therefore looked on one another, doubting of whom He spake.

23. Now there was one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, sitting next Him.

24. Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him to ask, who it was concerning whom He spake.

25. And he, reclining on the breast of Jesus, saith unto Him, Lord, who is it?

26. Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it: and He dipped in a sop and gave it to Judas the Iscariot the son of Simon.

27. And after the sop Satan entred into him. Then Jesus saith unto him, What thou dost, do quickly.

28. But none of those that sat at table knew wherefore He said this to him.

29. For some of them thought, because Judas kept the purse, that Jesus said to him, Buy what things we have need of against the feast: or that he should give something to the poor.

30. He therefore, when he had taken the sop, immediately went out. And it was night.

31. And when he was gone out Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him:

32. and if God be glorified in Him, God will glorify Him in Himself, and will soon glorify Him.

33. Little children, I am to be with you but a little while longer. Ye will wish for me, and as I said to the Jews, "Whither I go ye cannot come", so I now tell you.

34. A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; ---as I have loved you, that ye also love one another: for by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples,

35. if ye have mutual love to each other.

36. Simon Peter saith unto Him, Lord, whither art thou going? Jesus answered him, Whither I am going thou canst not follow me now, but thou shalt follow me hereafter.

37. Peter saith unto Him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.

38. Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily verily I tell thee, The cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice. 

## John 14

1. Let not your heart be troubled: believe in God, believe also in me.

2. In my Father's house there are many mansions; if not, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you.

3. And as I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself, that where I am, ye may also be.

4. And ye know where I am going, and ye know the way.

5. Thomas saith unto Him, Lord, we know not whither thou art going, and how can we know the way?

6. Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father but by me.

7. If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye do know Him, and may be said to have seen Him.

8. Philip saith unto Him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.

9. Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long with you, and dost thou not know me? Philip, he that hath seen me, hath seen the Father: and how then dost thou say, Shew us the Father?

10. Dost thou not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? as to the words which I speak to you, I speak them not of my self; and the Father who abideth in me, doth the works.

11. Believe me therefore that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: at lest, believe me for the very works.

12. Verily, verily I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I perform he also shall perform, and greater than these shall he do: because I am going to the Father.

13. And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, I will do it: that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

14. If ye ask any thing in my name, I will do it.

15. If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father,

16. and He will give you another comforter to abide with you for ever:

17. even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him: but ye know Him, because He abideth with you, and shall be in you.

18. I will not leave you orphans: I will come to you.

19. Yet a little while, and the world shall see me no more; but ye shall see me: and because I live, ye shall live also.

20. Then ye shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.

21. He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest my self to him.

22. Judas (not the Iscariot) saith unto Him, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thy self to us, and not to the world?

23. Jesus answered and said unto him, If any one love me, he will observe my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and will make our abode with him.

24. He that doth not love me, doth not observe my words: and yet the word that ye hear, is not mine, but the Father's who hath sent me.

25. These things have I spoken unto you, while I have been with you.

26. But the comforter, that is the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I have said unto you.

27. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, do I give unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

28. Ye have heard, how I said unto you, "I am going away, and I shall come again to you." If ye loved me, ye would rejoice that I said, I am going to the Father: for my Father is greater than I.

29. And now I have told you before it come to pass, that when it cometh to pass ye may believe.

30. I shall not have much more conversation with you: for the prince of this world is coming; not that he hath any thing in me,

31. but that the world may know that I love the Father, and that I do as the Father hath commanded me. Arise, let us go hence. 

## John 15

1. I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman:

2. every branch in me that beareth not fruit He taketh away, and every one that beareth fruit, He purgeth, that it may bear more fruit.

3. Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.

4. Abide therefore in me, and I will abide in you: for as the branch cannot bear fruit of it self, unless it abide in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye abide in me.

5. I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in me, and I in him, beareth much fruit: but without me ye can do nothing.

6. If any one abide not in me, he is cast out as a useless branch and withereth: and they gather them up, and throw them into the fire, and they are burnt.

7. If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask what ye will, and it shall be granted you.

8. Herein is my father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; and so shall ye be my disciples.

9. As the Father hath loved me, and I have loved you, continue in my love:

10. and if ye keep my commandments ye will continue in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and continue in his love.

11. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy in you may continue, and that your joy may be full.

12. This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.

13. Greater love hath no one than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends:

14. and ye are my friends, if ye do what I command you.

15. I no longer stile you servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doth: but I have called you friends; for whatsoever I have heard from my Father, I have made known to you.

16. Ye did not first choose me, but I chose you, and have appointed you to go forth, and bear fruit, and that your fruit should be lasting: that whatsoever ye ask the Father in my name, He may give it you.

17. These commands I give you, that ye should love one another.

18. If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me first.

19. If ye were of the world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.

20. Remember what I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you: if they have observed my word, they will also observe yours.

21. But all these things will they do unto you, on my account, because they know not Him that sent me.

22. If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin.

23. He that hateth me, hateth my Father also.

24. If I had not done among them such works as no other ever did, they had not comparatively had sin: but now they have both seen, and hated, both me and my Father.

25. But thus it is that the word might be fulfilled, which is written in their law, they hated me without a cause.

26. But when the comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, (even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father,) He shall testify of me.

27. And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning. 

## John 16

1. These things have I spoken unto you, that ye may not be offended:

2. for they will excommunicate you: yea, the time is coming, that whosoever killeth you, will think that he offers an acceptable service to God.

3. And these things will they do unto you; because they have not known the Father, nor me.

4. But I have told you these things, that when the time cometh, ye may remember that I told you of them. Though I did not tell you of them at the beginning, because I was with you.

5. But now I am going away to Him that sent me, and yet none of you asketh me, Whither art thou going? but because I have said these things to you,

6. sorrow hath filled your heart.

7. Nevertheless I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I should go away; for if I go not away, the comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto you.

8. And when He comes, He will convince the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgement:

9. of sin, because they believe not on me;

10. of righteousness, because I am going to my Father and ye shall see me no more;

11. and of judgement, because the prince of this world is judged.

12. I have yet many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them now.

13. But when the Spirit of truth is come, He will guide you into all truth: for He will not speak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that will He speak, and will shew you things to come.

14. He shall glorify me, for He shall take of mine and shew it unto you.

15. All that the Father hath are mine: therefore I said, that He shall take of mine and shew it unto you.

16. A little while and ye shall not see me: and again a little while and ye shall see me, because I am going to the Father.

17. Some of his disciples therefore said one to another, What is the meaning of this that He saith to us, A little while and ye shall not see me, and again a little while and ye shall see me, and---because I am going to the Father?

18. they said therefore, What is this little while that He speaks of? we do not understand what He means.

19. Now Jesus knew that they wanted to ask Him, and therefore said unto them, Are ye enquiring among each other about this, that I said, A little while and ye shall not see me, and again a little while and ye shall see me?

20. Verily I tell you, that ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.

21. A woman when she is in labor, hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she is delivered of the child, she thinks no more of the anguish, for joy, that a man is born into the world.

22. And ye therefore now have sorrow; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy shall no one take from you.

23. And in that day ye shall ask me nothing: but I assure you, that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, He will give it you.

24. Hitherto ye have asked for nothing in my name: ask and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.

25. These things have I spoken to you in parables: but the time is coming when I shall no more speak to you in parables, but tell you with plainness concerning the Father.

26. In that day ye shall ask in my name; and I do not say that I will ask the Father on your behalf.

27. For the Father himself loveth you; because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came from God: and I indeed came from the Father,

28. and am come into the world: but now I am leaving the world again, and am going to the Father.

29. His disciples said unto Him, Now indeed Thou speakest plainly, and usest no parable.

30. Now we are convinced that Thou knowest all things, and hast no need that any one should ask Thee: by this we believe that Thou camest forth from God.

31. Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?

32. Behold, the time is coming, and is even now come, that ye shall be dispersed every one his own way, and shall leave me alone: but I am not alone, for the Father is with me.

33. These things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have trouble: but be of good courage, I have overcome the world. 

## John 17

1. When Jesus had spoken these words, He lifted up his eyes to heaven and said,---"Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify Thee:

2. as Thou hast given Him power over all flesh, that as to all which Thou hast given Him, He might give them eternal life;

3. and this is life eternal, to know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.

4. I have glorified Thee on earth, I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do:

5. and now, O Father, glorify Thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was made.

6. I have manifested thy name to the men, whom Thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and Thou gavest them to me, and they have kept thy word.

7. They now know that all things whatsoever Thou hast given me, are indeed from Thee;

8. for the instructions, which Thou gavest me, I have given to them: and they have received them, and have known of a truth that I came from Thee, and have believed that thou hast sent me.

9. I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for those whom Thou hast given me, for they are thine.

10. And all my concerns are thine, and thine are mine: and I am therefore glorified in them.

11. And as I am to be no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to Thee, Holy Father, keep by thy name those whom Thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.

12. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name; I have preserved those whom Thou gavest me, and none of them is lost; except the son of perdition, that the scripture might be fulfilled.

13. But now I am coming to Thee, and I speak these things in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in them.

14. I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

15. I do not pray that Thou wouldest take them out of the world, but that thou wouldest keep them from the evil.

16. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

17. Sanctify them by thy truth: thy word is truth.

18. As Thou hast sent me into the world, so have I also sent them into the world.

19. And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified through the truth.

20. Nor do I pray for these only, but for them also that shall believe on me through their word.

21. That they all may be one, as Thou, O Father, art in me, and I in Thee; that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.

22. And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them: that they may be one, even as we are one.

23. I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that Thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as Thou hast loved me.

24. Father, I desire that they also, whom thou hast given me, may be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for Thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.

25. O righteous Father, the world indeed hath not known Thee: but I have known Thee, and these have known that Thou hast sent me.

26. And I have made known to them thy name, and will farther make it known; that the love wherewith Thou hast loved me, may be in them, and I also in them. 

## John 18

1. When Jesus had spoken these words, He went out with his disciples over the brook Kedron; where there was a garden, into which He entred, and his disciples. Now Judas who was gone to betray Him,

2. knew the place: for Jesus often met there together with his disciples: Judas therefore having got a band of soldiers,

3. and officers from the chief priests and pharisees, cometh thither with candles, and lamps, and arms.

4. Upon which Jesus, who knew all that was coming upon Him, went forth and said unto them, Whom do ye seek? They answered Him, Jesus the Nazarene.

5. Jesus saith unto them, I am He. And Judas that betrayed Him, was standing with them.

6. Now as soon as He said unto them, I am He, they went backwards and fell to the ground.

7. Then He asked them again, Whom do ye seek?

8. And they said, Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus answered, I have told you that I am He: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:

9. That the word might be fulfilled which He had spoken, "Of those, whom Thou hast given me, I have lost none."

10. Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.

11. But Jesus said to Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?

12. So the band with the captain, and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus, and bound Him:

13. and led Him away to Annas first: (for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high-priest that year:)

14. and Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high-priest. Now Caiaphas was he who had said in council to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.

15. And Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. And that other disciple being known to the high priest went in with Jesus into the high-priest's hall.

16. But Peter stood at the door without: the other disciple therefore, who was known to the high-priest, went out and spake to her that kept the door, and brought Peter in.

17. Then saith the maid, that kept the door, to Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? and he said, I am not.

18. And the servants and officers stood there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold, and were warming themselves: and Peter was standing with them and warming himself.

19. The high-priest therefore asked Jesus concerning his disciples, and his doctrine.

20. Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world, I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, whither the Jews are continually resorting: and in secret have said nothing. Why dost thou ask me?

21. ask them that heard me, what I have said unto them: for they know what I have said.

22. And upon his saying these things, one of the officers that stood by struck Jesus, saying, Dost thou answer the high-priest thus?

23. Jesus answered him, If I have ever spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why dost thou strike me?

24. [See verse 24 between verse 13 and 14.]

25. And Simon Peter stood warming himself: and they said to him, Art not thou one of his disciples? and he denied it, and said, I am not.

26. Then said one of the servants of the high-priest, kinsman to him whose ear Peter cut off, Did not I see thee in the garden with Him?

27. Peter then denied it again, and immediately the cock crew.

28. Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the pretorium: (now it was morning) and they themselves went not in to the court, least they should be defiled, and so might not eat of the passover.

29. Therefore Pilate went out to them, and said, What accusation do ye bring against this man?

30. They answered him, If He were not a malefactor, we should not have delivered Him to thee.

31. Then said Pilate to them, Take Him, and judge Him according to your law. But the Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:

32. that what Jesus had said might be fulfilled, signifying by what death He should die.

33. Pilate therefore went into the palace again, and called Jesus and said to Him, Art thou the king of the Jews?

34. Jesus answered him, Dost thou say this from thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?

35. Pilate replied, Am I a Jew? thine own nation, and the chief priests, have delivered thee to me: what hast thou done?

36. Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have fought, that I might not have been delivered to the Jews: but my kingdom is not from hence.

37. Pilate therefore said unto Him, Art thou then a king? Jesus answered, Thou sayest right, I am a king. For this end was I born, and for this came I into the world, even that I might bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice.

38. Pilate saith unto Him, What is truth? And as soon as he had spoke, he went out again to the Jews,

39. and saith unto them, I find no fault at all in Him. But ye have a custom, that I should release to you one at the passover; will ye therefore that I release to you the king of the Jews?

40. Then they all cried out again, saying, Not Him, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber. 

## John 19

1. Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged Him.

2. And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head,

3. and threw a purple robe about Him, and said, "Hail king of the Jews," and struck Him with their hands.

4. Pilate therefore came out again, and saith unto them, Behold I bring Him out to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in Him.

5. So Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, "Behold the man."

6. When the chief priests therefore and the officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, "Crucify Him, crucify Him." Pilate saith unto them, Take Him yourselves, and crucify Him: for I find no fault in Him.

7. The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law He ought to die, because He made himself the Son of God.

8. Now when Pilate heard this he was the more afraid;

9. and went into the palace again, and saith to Jesus, From whence art thou? but Jesus gave him no answer.

10. Pilate therefore saith unto Him, Dost thou not speak to me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?

11. Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above; wherefore he, that delivered me up to thee, hath the greater sin.

12. Upon this Pilate sought to release Him; but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Cesar's friend; for whosoever maketh himself a king, opposeth Cesar.

13. Therefore when Pilate heard this he brought Jesus forth, and sat down on the tribunal, in a place called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.

14. (And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour.) And he saith to the Jews, Behold your king. But they cried out,

15. Away with Him, away with Him, crucify Him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Cesar.

16. Then delivered he Him therefore unto them to be crucified.

17. And they took Jesus, and led Him away. And He went out, bearing his cross, into a place called the place of a scull, in Hebrew Golgotha:

18. where they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on each side, and Jesus in the middle.

19. And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross: and there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.

20. Many of the Jews therefore read this inscription; for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.

21. And the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Write not "The king of the Jews," but that "He said, I am king of the Jews."

22. Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.

23. And the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, (and made four parts, to each soldier a part,) and his coat. Now the coat had no seam in it, being woven from the top throughout:

24. they said therefore to one another, Let us not cut it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, "They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots." These things therefore the soldiers did.

25. Now there stood near the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.

26. Jesus therefore seeing his mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, saith to his mother, Woman, behold thy son:

27. and then saith to the disciple, Behold thy mother. And from that hour the same disciple took her to his own home.

28. After this Jesus knowing that all things were now finished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.

29. Now there was set a vessel there full of vinegar: so they filled a spunge with the vinegar, and putting it upon hyssop, held it up to his mouth.

30. And when Jesus had received the vinegar, He said, It is finished. And reclining his head, He yielded up the ghost.

31. The Jews therefore, that the bodies might not remain upon the cross on the sabbath-day, because it was now the preparation, (for that sabbath-day was an high-day) desired Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.

32. So the soldiers came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with Him. But coming to Jesus,

33. as they saw He was dead already, they did not break his legs:

34. but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.

35. And he that saw it testifieth it, and his testimony is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye may believe.

36. For these things were done, that the scripture might be fulfilled, Not a bone of Him shall be broken.

37. And again another scripture saith, They shall look on Him whom they have pierced.

38. And after these things Joseph of Arimathea (who was a disciple of Jesus, but a concealed one for fear of the Jews) petitioned Pilate, that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him leave: he came therefore and took away the body of Jesus.

39. And there came also Nicodemus (who at first came to Jesus by night) and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred pound weight.

40. So they took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen cloths, with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.

41. Now there was a garden in the place where He was crucified; and in the garden a new sepulchre, in which none had ever yet been laid.

42. There therefore they laid Jesus, because of the Jews preparation-day; for the sepulchre was near. 

## John 20

1. Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene cometh early in the morning, while it was yet dark, to the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.

2. She therefore runneth and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid Him.

3. Peter therefore went out, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.

4. So they both ran together, but the other disciple out-ran Peter, and came first to the sepulchre:

5. and stooping down to look in saw the linen cloths lying; but did not go in.

6. Then cometh Simon Peter, who followed him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen cloths lying there;

7. and the napkin that was upon his head, not laid with the linen cloths, but folded up by itself.

8. Then went in also the other disciple; who came first to the sepulchre, and he saw and believed.

9. For they did not before understand the scripture, that He must rise from the dead.

10. So the two disciples went away again to their own company.

11. But Mary stood without near the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept she stooped down to look into the sepulchre; and there seeth two angels in white sitting,

12. one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.

13. And they said to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him.

14. And having said this, she turned back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.

15. Then said Jesus to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? whom dost thou seek? She thinking that it was the gardener, saith to Him, Sir, if thou hast carried Him hence, tell me where thou hast laid Him, and I will take Him away.

16. Jesus saith unto her, Mary: and she turned herself and said unto Him, Rabboni, that is to say, Master.

17. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not now; for I am not yet ascended to my Father; but go directly to my brethren, and tell them, "I am to ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God."

18. So Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples, that she had seen the Lord, and that He had said these things to her.

19. Now the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, and the doors where the disciples were being shut, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be to you.

20. And when He had said this, He shewed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore rejoiced when they saw the Lord.

21. Then said Jesus unto them again, Peace be to you. As my Father sent me, even so send I you.

22. And when He said this, He breathed upon them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the holy Spirit:

23. and whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; but whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.

24. But Thomas called Didymus, one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came.

25. The other disciples therefore told him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and my hand into his side, I will not believe.

26. And after eight days his disciples were again within, and Thomas with them: and Jesus came (the doors being shut as before) and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be to you.

27. Then saith He to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands, and reach hither thy hand, and put it into my side; and be not incredulous, but believing.

28. And Thomas answered, and said, "My Lord and my God."

29. Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.

30. And indeed Jesus wrought many other signs also in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:

31. but these things are written, that ye may believe, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life through his name. 

## John 21

1. After these things Jesus shewed Himself again to the disciples near the sea of Tiberias; and He shewed Himself thus.

2. Simon Peter and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together:

3. and Simon Peter saith unto them, I will go a fishing, and they say to him, We will also go with thee. So they went out, and forthwith entered into a ship: and that night they caught nothing.

4. But when it was morning, Jesus stood on the shore: though the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.

5. Then Jesus saith unto them, Young men, have ye any thing to eat?

6. They answered Him, No. And He said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye will find some. So they cast it, and they were not able to draw it up by reason of the multitude of fishes.

7. Whereupon that disciple whom Jesus loved, saith to Peter, "It is the Lord." Then Simon Peter perceiving that it was the Lord, girded on his coat, (for he was stript,) and threw himself into the sea;

8. and the other disciples came in the boat dragging the net of fishes; for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits.

9. And as soon as they were come to land, they saw a fire laid, and fish upon it, and bread.

10. And Jesus saith unto them, Bring some of the fish, which ye have now caught.

11. Then Simon Peter went aboard, and drew the net to land, full of large fishes, an hundred fifty-three: and though there were so many, the net was not broken.

12. Jesus saith unto them, Come, and dine. And none of the disciples presumed to ask Him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.

13. Jesus therefore cometh and taketh bread, and giveth it to them, and fish likewise.

14. This was the third time that Jesus shewed Himself to a number of his disciples, after He was risen from the dead.

15. Now when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon son of Jonas, dost thou love me more than these? He saith unto Him, Yes, Lord, Thou knowest that I love Thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.

16. He saith to him again the second time, Simon son of Jonas, dost thou love me? He saith unto Him, Yes, Lord, Thou knowest that I love Thee.

17. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep. He saith unto him the third time, Simon son of Jonas, dost thou love me? Peter was grieved, that He said to him the third time, Dost thou love me? And he said unto Him, Lord, Thou knowest all things, Thou knowest that I love Thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.

18. Verily, verily I say unto thee, When thou wast younger, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst about where thou wouldest: but when thou art old, thou shalt stretch out thine hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee where thou wouldest not.

19. This He said, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when He had said this, He saith unto him, Follow me.

20. And Peter turning about seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved, (and who leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, who is he that will betray Thee?) following them;

21. and upon seeing him, Peter saith to Jesus, Lord, what shall this man do?

22. Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he stay till I come, what is it to thee? Follow thou me.

23. This rumor therefore was spread among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: though Jesus did not say that he should not die, but---if I will that he stay till I come, what is that to thee?

24. This is the disciple that testifieth of these things, and that writeth them: and we know that his testimony is true.

25. There are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were to be described particularly, I suppose that the whole world could not contain the books that would be written concerning them. Amen.
