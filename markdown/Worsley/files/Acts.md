# Acts

## Acts 1

1. The former treatise, O Theophilus, I made concerning all that Jesus undertook both to do and to teach;

2. till the day in which He was taken up, after He had by the holy Spirit given instructions to the apostles whom He had chosen:

3. to whom also He presented Himself alive, after He had suffered, by many certain proofs; being seen among them for forty days, and speaking of the things relating to the kingdom of God.

4. And meeting them together He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, said He, ye have heard from me;

5. for John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall within a few days be baptized with the holy Spirit.

6. Being therefore come together they asked Him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?

7. And He said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or seasons, which the Father hath reserved in his own power.

8. But ye shall receive power from the holy Spirit coming upon you: and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth.

9. And having said these things, as they were looking upon Him, He was lifted up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight.

10. And while they were looking stedfastly toward heaven, as He went up, behold two men in white stood by them;

11. who said, Ye men of Galilee, why do ye stand gazing up to heaven? This Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in the manner ye have seen Him going into heaven.

12. Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath-day's journey.

13. And when they were come in to the city, they went up into an upper room, where Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon the zealot, and Jude the brother of James, usually abode.

14. These all persevered with one accord in prayer and supplication with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brethren.

15. And in these days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, (now the number of the persons that were together was about an hundred and twenty,)

16. and said, Men and brethren, it was necessary that this scripture should be fulfilled, which the holy Ghost spake by the mouth of David, concerning Judas, who was guide to them that apprehended Jesus:

17. for he was numbered with us, and had obtained a part of this ministry.

18. (Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling down on his face, burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out:

19. (and it was known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field is called in their own dialect, Aceldama, that is, the field of blood:)

20. for it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let none dwell in it; and again, Let another take his office.)

21. Wherefore it is necessary that one of these men, who have been conversant with us all the time that the Lord Jesus came in and out among us,

22. from the baptism of John, till the day that He was taken up from us, should be joined with us as a witness of his resurrection.

23. And they proposed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.

24. And they prayed and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all, shew us, which of these two Thou hast chosen,

25. to take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas is fallen by his transgression, that he might go to his own place.

26. And they gave out their lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the apostles. 

## Acts 2

1. And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all met together with one accord.

2. And suddenly there was a sound from heaven as of a strong rushing wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.

3. And there appeared unto them divided tongues, as it were of fire, and it sat upon each of them:

4. and they were all filled with the holy Spirit, and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them utterance.

5. Now there were at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven.

6. And when this rumor was spread, the multitude came together and were astonished; for every one heard them speaking in his own language.

7. And they were all amazed and wondered, saying to one another, Behold, are not all these, that are speaking, Galileans?

8. and how do we every one hear them in our own native tongue?

9. Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and those that dwell in Mesopotamia, and Judea, and Capadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia,

10. Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers from Rome, Jews and proselytes,

11. Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our own tongues the wonderful works of God.

12. And they were all amazed and in doubt, saying one to another, What can this mean?

13. but others scoffing said, they are full of sweet wine.

14. But Peter standing up with the eleven, raised his voice and said unto them, Ye men of Judea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and listen to my words:

15. for these men are not drunk, as ye suppose; for it is but the third hour of the day.

16. But this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel,

17. "And it shall come to pass in the last days (saith God) that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy; and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:

18. yea and on my servants and on my handmaids, in those days, I will pour out of my Spirit, and they also shall prophesy.

19. And I will give prodigies in the heaven, and signs upon the earth; blood, and fire, and smoky vapour.

20. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and illustrious day of the Lord come.

21. And whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved."

22. Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you, by miracles, and prodigies, and signs, which God wrought by Him in the midst of you,

23. (as ye yourselves also know,) Him being given up by the determinate counsel and fore-knowlege of God ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain.

24. Whom God hath raised up again, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that He should be held by it.

25. For David saith concerning Him, "I set the Lord always before me, for He is at my right hand, that I should not be moved: therefore my heart rejoiced, and my tongue was glad;

26. and my flesh shall rest in hope,

27. that Thou wilt not leave my soul in the invisible state, nor suffer thine holy one to see corruption.

28. Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; and Thou wilt fill me with joy by the light of thy countenance."

29. Men and brethren, allow me to speak with freedom to you concerning the patriarch David, that he is dead and buried, and his sepulchre is among us to this day.

30. Therefore being a prophet; and knowing that God had sworn to him with an oath, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up the Messiah, to sit on his throne;

31. foreseeing this he spake of the resurrection of Christ, when he said, that his soul was not left in the invisible state, nor did his flesh see corruption.

32. This Jesus hath God raised up from the dead, of which we all are witnesses.

33. Therefore being exalted by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the holy Spirit, He hath poured forth this gift, which ye now see and hear.

34. For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he himself says, "The Lord said to my Lord,

35. Sit thou at my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool."

36. Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made this very Jesus, whom ye crucified, both Lord and Christ.

37. Now when they heard this, they were pricked to the heart, and said unto Peter, and to the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what shall we do?

38. And Peter said unto them, Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the holy Spirit:

39. for the promise is to you and to your children, yea and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.

40. And with many other words did he press and exhort them, saying, Save yourselves from this perverse generation.

41. They therefore that received his word with readiness were baptized: and in that same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.

42. And they continued stedfast in the apostles doctrine, and fellowship, and in the breaking of bread, and in prayers.

43. And fear came upon all the people: and many miracles and signs were wrought by the apostles.

44. And all that believed were together, and had all things common.

45. And they sold their possessions and goods, and distributed to all, according as any one had need.

46. And continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with gladness and simplicity of heart,

47. praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved. 

## Acts 3

1. Now Peter and John were going up to the temple together at the hour of prayer, which is the ninth hour.

2. And a certain man who had been lame from his birth was carried along; whom they laid every day at the gate of the temple, which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of those that were going into the temple:

3. who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked alms of them.

4. But Peter, and John, looking earnestly at him said, Look on us.

5. And he fixed his eyes upon them, expecting to receive something from them.

6. But Peter said, Silver and gold I have not; but what I have I give thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.

7. And taking him by the right hand, he raised him up: and immediately his feet and ancles were strengthened:

8. and leaping up he stood firm, and walked; and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.

9. And all the people saw him walking and praising God:

10. and knew that it was he who sat to ask for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with astonishment and extasy at what had befallen him.

11. And as the lame man that was healed had hold of Peter and John, all the people being astonished ran together to them to the porch called Solomon's porch.

12. And Peter seeing this said to the people, Men of Israel, why marvel ye at this, or why look ye so earnestly on us, as if by our own power or piety we had made this man able to walk?

13. The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers hath glorified his son Jesus, whom ye delivered up, and denied before Pilate, when he determined to release Him.

14. But ye refused the holy and righteous One, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you:

15. and put to death the prince of life; whom God hath raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.

16. And through faith in his name, hath strengthened this man, whom ye see and know: his name, I say, and saith in Him, hath wrought this perfect cure before you all.

17. And now, brethren, I know that ye did it through ignorance, as did also your rulers:

18. but thus hath God accomplished those things which He had foretold by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer.

19. Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out: that seasons of refreshing may come upon you from the presence of the Lord;

20. and He may send Jesus Christ, who was before preached unto you:

21. whom heaven must indeed receive till the times of settling all things, of which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets from the beginning.

22. For Moses said unto the fathers, the Lord your God will raise up a prophet unto you, of your brethren, like me, Him shall ye hear in all things whatever He shall say unto you;

23. and every soul, who will not hearken to that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people: yea and all the prophets from Samuel,

24. and those that followed, as many as have prophesied, have also foretold these days.

25. Now ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant, which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, "And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed:"

26. and to you first God having raised up his son Jesus, sent Him to bless you; in your turning away every one of you from your iniquities. 

## Acts 4

1. And while they were speaking to the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the sadducees came upon them,

2. being vexed that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.

3. And they laid hands on them, and put them into custody till the next day: for it was now evening.

4. But many of them who heard the word, believed: and the number of the men was about five thousand.

5. And on the morrow their rulers, and elders, and scribes were gathered together at Jerusalem:

6. and with them Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest.

7. And when they had set them in the midst, they asked them, By what power, or in what name have ye done this?

8. Then Peter filled with the holy Spirit said unto them, Ye rulers of the people,

9. and elders of Israel, if we are this day examined about the benefit done to the impotent man,

10. by what means he is cured, be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, but whom God hath raised from the dead, even by Him doth this man stand here before you whole.

11. This is the stone that was set at nought by you builders, which is become the head of the corner.

12. And there is salvation in no other; for there is no other name under heaven given among men, by which we can be saved.

13. Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were plain and illiterate men, they were amazed; and they knew them again that they had been with Jesus:

14. but seeing the man that was cured standing with them, they had nothing to say against it.

15. Therefore they ordered them to withdraw from the council,

16. and conferred among themselves, saying, What shall we do with these men? for that indeed an evident miracle hath been wrought by them is manifest to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.

17. But that it may spread no farther among the people, let us severely charge them to speak no more to any man in this name.

18. So they called them and commanded them not to speak at all, nor teach in the name of Jesus.

19. But Peter and John answered them, and said, Whether it be right in the sight of God to obey you rather than God, judge ye:

20. for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.

21. So they threatened them more severely, and let them go; not finding how to punish them, because of the people: for they all glorified God for that which was done.

22. For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miraculous cure was wrought.

23. Being dismissed they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.

24. And when they heard it, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, Thou art God, who hast made heaven and earth, and sea, and all things therein:

25. who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?

26. The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his anointed.

27. For of a truth both Herod and Pontius Pilate, the Gentiles and the people of Israel, combined against thy holy child Jesus,

28. (whom Thou hast anointed,) to do whatever thy hand and thy counsel had before determined to be done.

29. And now, Lord, behold their threatenings; and give unto thy servants to speak thy word with all freedom, while Thou art stretching forth thy hand to heal,

30. and while signs and wonders are done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.

31. And when they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled was shaken; and they were all filled with the holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with freedom.

32. And the heart and soul of the multitude that believed was one: no one called any of his possessions his own property, but they had all things common.

33. And with great power did the apostles give their testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.

34. Neither was there any indigent person among them; for as many as were proprietors of lands or houses, sold them and brought the prices of what were sold,

35. and laid them at the apostles feet; and distribution was made to every one according to their necessity.

36. So Joses who was by the apostles sirnamed Barnabas, which is a son of consolation,

37. a Levite, by birth a Cyprian, having an estate, sold it and brought the money, and laid it at the feet of the apostles. 

## Acts 5

1. But a certain man named Ananias, together with Sapphira his wife,

2. sold a possession, and secreted part of the price, his wife also being conscious to it; and bringing: some part, laid it at the feet of the apostles.

3. But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan so filled thine heart, that thou shouldst lie to the holy Ghost, and keep back part of the price of the land?

4. While it remained, did it not remain thy own? and when sold, was it not in thy own power? what is the meaning that thou hast taken this into thine heart? Thou hast not lyed to men, but to God.

5. And Ananias at the hearing of these words fell down and expired: and great fear came on all that heard these things.

6. And some of the young men arose, and wrapped him up; and they carried him out, and buried him.

7. And about the space of three hours after, his wife also came in, not knowing what had happened.

8. And Peter said to her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much. And she said, Yes, for so much.

9. Then Peter said unto her, Wherefore have ye agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold the feet of those, who have been burying thy husband, now at the door, and they shall carry thee out.

10. And immediately she fell down at his feet and expired: and the young men coming in found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband.

11. And great fear came upon the whole assembly, and upon all that heard these things.

12. And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders done among the people: And they all met with one accord in Solomon's portico:

13. but no other presumed to join himself to them; however the people magnified them.

14. And true believers were the more willingly added to the Lord, even multitudes both of men and women.

15. insomuch that they brought the sick out into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at lest the shadow of Peter, as he came by, might pass over some of them.

16. And a great number out of the cities round about also came together to Jerusalem, bringing those that were infirm and that were troubled with impure spirits; and they were all cured.

17. Then the high priest rose up, and all that were with him, (being of the sect of the sadducees,) and were filled with rage:

18. and laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the public prison.

19. But an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison by night, and having brought them out said,

20. "Go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life."

21. And hearing this, they went early in the morning into the temple and taught the people. But the high priest being come, and they that were with him, to the council-chamber, they called together the Sanhedrim, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent orders to the prison that they should be brought before them.

22. But when the officers came they found them not in the prison: so they returned,

23. and told them, saying, the prison we found shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we opened them, we found no body within.

24. Now when the high priest, and the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were in doubt concerning them, what this would come to;

25. when there came one and told them, saying, behold, the men whom ye put in prison, are in the temple teaching the people.

26. Then the captain went with the officers and brought them, but not with violence; for they were afraid of the people least they should be stoned:

27. and when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest asked them,

28. saying, Did not we strictly charge you not to teach in this name? and behold ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and would bring this man's blood upon us.

29. But Peter, and the other apostles, answered, and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.

30. The God of our fathers hath raised up Jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.

31. Him hath God exalted with his right hand as a prince and saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins:

32. and we are his witnesses of what we declare; and so is the holy Spirit, whom God hath given to them that obey Him.

33. And when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to put them to death.

34. But a certain pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, held in much esteem by all the people, stood up in the council, and ordered the apostles to be taken out a little while; and then he said unto them,

35. Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves, what ye are about to do, as to these men.

36. For some time ago one Theudas arose, pretending to be some extraordinary person, to whom was joined a number of men, about four hundred: who was slain, and all that followed him were dispersed and came to nothing.

37. After him arose Judas the Galilean, at the time of the registring, and drew much people after him: but he also perished, and all that followed him were dispersed.

38. And therefore as to the present affair I advise you to refrain from these men and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nothing;

39. but if it be of God, ye cannot defeat it, least ye be found fighting even against God.

40. So they took his advice, and having called for the apostles and scourged them, they charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.

41. And they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer disgrace for his name.

42. And every day in the temple and from house to house they ceased not from teaching and preaching that Jesus was the Christ. 

## Acts 6

1. Now in those days, as the number of disciples increased, there rose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily distribution.

2. So the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them and said, It is not seemly that we should leave the word of God and attend at tables.

3. Wherefore, brethren, look out from among you seven men of good character, full of the holy Spirit, and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this matter:

4. but we will constantly attend to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.

5. And the advice pleased the whole multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith, and of the holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus a proselyte of Antioch.

6. These they set before the apostles; who, when they had prayed, laid their hands upon them.

7. And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was greatly multiplied; and a great number of the priests became obedient to the faith.

8. Now Stephen being full of grace and power, wrought miracles and great signs among the people.

9. But there rose up some of the synagogue, which is called that of the libertines, and some of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia, and Asia, to dispute with Stephen:

10. and they were not able to resist the wisdom and spirit by which he spake.

11. Then they suborned men to say, we heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.

12. And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes; and they came upon him, and forced him along with them, and brought him to the council:

13. and they set up false witnesses; who said, This man is continually speaking blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law.

14. For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and change the rites which Moses delivered to us.

15. (And all that were sitting in the council, looking stedfastly at him, saw his face like the face of an angel.) 

## Acts 7

1. Then said the high priest, Are these things so?

2. And he said, "Brethren and fathers, hearken,---The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,

3. and said to him, Depart from thy native country and from thy kindred, and come into the country which I shall shew thee.

4. Then he came out of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, after his father died, He removed him into this land in which ye now dwell:

5. though He gave him no inheritance in it, no not the breadth of a foot; but He promised to give it to him for a possession, even to his seed after him; though he had then no child."

6. And God spake thus unto him, "that his seed should sojourn in a strange country, and they shall in slave and abuse them four hundred years:"

7. and God said, "I will judge the nation, to which they shall be in slavery; and afterwards they shall come out, and shall worship me in this place."

8. And He gave him the covenant of circumcision: and he begat Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.

9. And the patriarchs, envying him, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,

10. and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he appointed him governor over Egypt, and over all his houshold.

11. And there came a famine over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction; and our fathers could not find sustenance.

12. But Jacob hearing that there was corn in Egypt, sent out our fathers first:

13. and at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known to Pharaoh.

14. Then Joseph sent for his father Jacob, and all his kindred, even seventy-five souls.

15. So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died there, he and our fathers:

16. and were carried to Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre which he had bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.

17. But as the time of the promise drew near, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt.

18. Till another king arose, who knew not Joseph. This king formed crafty schemes against our nation,

19. and oppressed our fathers, causing their children to be exposed, that their race might be extinguished.

20. In which time Moses was born, who was exceeding beautiful, and he was nourished up in his father's house three months: and when he was exposed,

21. Pharaoh's daughter took him up and nourished him for her own son.

22. And Moses was trained up in all the wisdom of the Egyptians: and he was mighty in words, and in deeds.

23. And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.

24. And seeing one of them injured he defended him, and smiting the Egyptian he avenged him that was wronged.

25. Now he supposed that his brethren would have understood that God would give them deliverance by his hand: but they understood not.

26. And the next day he came to them, as they were two of them fighting, and would have persuaded them to agree, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren, why do ye injure one another?

27. But he, that injured his neighbor, thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?

28. Wilt thou kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian yesterday?

29. Upon this Moses fled, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons.

30. And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina, an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.

31. Now Moses, when he saw it, was amazed at the sight; and as he came near to observe it, there was a voice of the Lord to him,

32. saying, "I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;" but Moses trembling durst not look on.

33. And the Lord said to him, "Take off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place on which thou standest is holy ground.

34. I have seen the oppression of my people that are in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. Therefore come now, and I will send thee into Egypt."

35. This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? did God send, by the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush, to be their ruler and deliverer.

36. And he brought them out, performing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the red sea, and in the wilderness, forty years.

37. ---This is that Moses who said unto the children of Israel, "A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of your brethren, like unto me; Him shall ye hear."

38. This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the angel that spake to him on mount Sinai, and with our fathers; and who received the oracles of life to give unto us.

39. To whom our fathers would not be subject, but renounced him, and in their hearts turned back into Egypt,

40. saying to Aaron, Make us gods to go before us; for as to this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him. And they made a calf in those days,

41. and offered sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.

42. Then God turned away, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets, "O house of Israel, did ye offer to me your victims and sacrifices, for the space of forty years in the wilderness?

43. yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them by: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon."

44. The tabernacle of witness was among our fathers in the wilderness, as He, that spake unto Moses, ordered him to make it according to the model which he had seen in the mount:

45. and which our fathers receiving, they with Joshua, brought into the territory of the nations, whom God drove out from before the face of our fathers, till the days of David, who found favor in the sight of God,

46. and was desirous to provide an habitation for the God of Jacob.

47. But Solomon built Him an house.

48. Though the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands, as the prophet saith,

49. "Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool; what house will ye build for me, saith the Lord, or what is the place of my rest?

50. hath not my hand made all these things?" ---

51. Ye stiff-necked, and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the holy Spirit: as your fathers did, so do ye.

52. Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? and slew those who prophesied concerning the coming of that righteous One, of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers;

53. who received the law by the ministration of angels, and yet have not kept it.

54. And when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart and gnashed their teeth at him.

55. But he being full of the holy Spirit looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God:

56. and he said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.

57. Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,

58. and cast him out of the city and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at the feet of a young man, whose name was Saul.

59. And they stoned Stephen calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.

60. And bending his knees, he cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this he fell asleep. 

## Acts 8

1. And Saul was well pleased with his execution. For at that time there was a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all dispersed through the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.

2. And some pious men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation for him.

3. But Saul made havock of the church, entring into the houses, and dragging out men and women, committed them to prison.

4. Now they that were dispersed went about preaching the word.

5. And Philip coming to the city of Samaria, preached Christ unto them.

6. And the people unanimously attended to the things which were spoken by Philip, hearing and seeing the miracles which he wrought:

7. for impure spirits crying with a loud voice came out of many that were possessed by them; and many paralytic and lame persons were cured.

8. And there was great joy in that city.

9. But there was before in the city a man named Simon practising magic and bewitching the people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great person.

10. Whom they all greatly regarded, from the lest to the greatest, saying, This man is as the great power of God.

11. And they were attentive to him, because he had for a considerable time astonished them by his magic arts.

12. But as they believed Philip, preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women;

13. and Simon himself also believed, and was baptized, and kept constantly with Philip: and beholding the signs and miracles that were wrought, he was amazed.

14. Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John:

15. who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy Spirit: (for He was not yet fallen upon any of them,

16. only they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus:) and then they laid their hands on them,

17. and they received the holy Spirit.

18. And when Simon saw that the holy Spirit was given by the imposition of the hands of the apostles, he offered them money,

19. saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the holy Spirit.

20. But Peter said unto him, Let thy money perish with thee, since thou thoughtest to purchase the gift of God with money.

21. Thou hast no part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.

22. Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray to God, if so be the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee:

23. for I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity.

24. And Simon answered, and said, Do ye pray to the Lord for me, that none of the things which ye have spoken may come upon me.

25. And they having testified and declared the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.

26. And an angel of the Lord spake to Philip, saying, Arise and go southward to the way that leads down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is desert.

27. And he arose and went; and behold a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, and her high-treasurer, who had come to Jerusalem to worship,

28. was returning, and as he sat in his chariot, was reading the prophet Esaias:

29. and the Spirit said to Philip, Go near and join thyself to this chariot. And Philip running up to him,

30. heard him reading the prophet Esaias, and said, Dost thou understand what thou readest?

31. And he said, How can I, unless some one guide me? and he desired Philip to come up and sit with him.

32. And the portion of scripture, which he was reading, was this, "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before it's shearer is dumb, so He opened not his mouth:

33. in his humiliation his judgement was taken away, and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken away from the earth."

34. And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom doth the prophet say this? of himself, or of some other person?

35. Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at this scripture, preached unto him Jesus.

36. And as they went on their way, they came to a certain water: and the eunuch said, See here is water, what hindereth me from being baptized?

37. And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.

38. And he ordered the chariot to stop: and they both went down to the water, Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.

39. And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more: but went on his way rejoicing.

40. But Philip was found at Azotus; and as he passed along, he preached the gospel in all the cities, till he came to Cesarea. 

## Acts 9

1. But Saul still breathing out threatnings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, came to the high priest, and desired of him letters to the synagogues at Damascus,

2. that if he should find any of this persuasion, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.

3. And as he was on his journey, and came near to Damascus, suddenly there shone round about him a light from heaven;

4. and he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

5. And he said, Who art Thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus the Nazarene whom thou art persecuting: it is hard for thee to kick against the goads.

6. And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise and go into the city, and it shall be told thee, what thou must do.

7. And the men that went along with him, stood astonished, hearing the voice, but seeing no one.

8. And Saul rose from the earth, but when he opened his eyes he could not see: so they led him by the hand, and brought him to Damascus.

9. And he was three days without sight, and did neither eat nor drink.

10. Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias, and he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.

11. And the Lord said unto him, Arise and go into the street which is called Strait, and enquire in the house of Judas for one Saul, of Tarsus:

12. for behold he is praying, and hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias, coming in and putting his hand upon him, that he might recover his sight.

13. And Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how much mischief he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:

14. and here too he hath authority from the chief priests to apprehend all that call upon thy name.

15. But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way, for he is the instrument I have chosen, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:

16. for I will shew him how great sufferings he must endure for my name.

17. And Ananias went away and came into the house; and putting his hands on him, said, "Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, who appeared to thee on the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the holy Spirit."

18. And immediately there fell from his eyes as it were scales; and he instantly recovered his sight, and arose and was baptized.

19. And when he had taken some nourishment, he was strengthened. Now Saul was with the disciples at Damascus for some time.

20. And he immediately preached Christ in the synagogues, that He is the Son of God.

21. But all that heard him, were amazed, and said, Is not this he that persecuted those in Jerusalem who called on this name, and came hither for this end, that he might carry them bound to the chief priests?

22. But Saul prevailed more and more, and confounded the Jews that dwelt at Damascus, fully proving that this same Jesus is the Christ.

23. And after a considerable time, the Jews conspired to kill him:

24. but Saul was apprised of their design. And they watched the gates day and night, to make away with him:

25. but the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall, in a basket.

26. And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he attempted to associate with the disciples: and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.

27. But Barnabas took and brought him to the apostles, and related to them, how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that He had spoken to him; and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.

28. And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem, and preaching openly in the name of the Lord Jesus:

29. and he talked and disputed with the Hellenists, who attempted to kill him:

30. but when the brethren knew it, they brought him down to Cesarea, and sent him away to Tarsus.

31. Then the churches throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, had rest, being edified and walking in the fear of the Lord; and through the consolation of the holy Spirit were multiplied.

32. And it came to pass that as Peter was going through all parts, he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda.

33. And there he found a man named Eneas, who had kept his bed eight years, with the palsy.

34. And Peter said unto him, Eneas, Jesus the Messiah, healeth thee. Arise, and make thy bed. And he rose up immediately.

35. And all that dwelt at Lydda and in Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.

36. And there was at Joppa a certain female disciple named Tabitha, who by interpretation is called in Greek Dorcas: and she was full of good works and alms-deeds.

37. And it happened, about the same time, that she fell sick and died: and when they had washed her they laid her out in an upper chamber.

38. And as Lydda was near to Joppa, the disciples hearing that Peter was there sent two men to him, intreating him that he would not delay to come to them.

39. Then Peter arose, and went with them: and when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber. And all the widows stood round him weeping, and shewing him the coats and garments which Dorcas made when she was with them.

40. But Peter, putting them all out, kneeled down and prayed: and then turning to the body he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.

41. And giving her his hand he raised her up, and calling the saints and widows he presented her alive.

42. And it was soon known throughout all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord.

43. And he staid many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner. 

## Acts 10

1. Now there was a certain man at Cesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band: a pious man,

2. and one that feared God, with all his house; giving also much alms to the people, and praying to God continually.

3. He evidently saw in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius!

4. and he looking earnestly at him, and being afraid, said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up as a memorial before God.

5. And now send men to Joppa, and fetch hither one Simon, whose sirname is Peter.

6. He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea-side: he shall tell thee what thou must do.

7. As soon as the angel, that spake to Cornelius, was departed, he called two of his domestic servants, and a devout soldier, that constantly attended him.

8. And when he had related all to them, he sent them to Joppa.

9. On the morrow, while they were on their journey, and drawing near to the city, Peter went up on the top of the house to pray, about the sixth hour.

10. And he was very hungry, and desired something to eat: but while they were getting it ready, he fell into a trance; and saw heaven opened,

11. and some thing descending to him, like a great sheet tied at the four corners, and let down to the earth:

12. in which were all kinds of four-footed creatures, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.

13. And there was a voice which said to him, Rise, Peter, kill and eat.

14. But Peter said, By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing polluted or unclean.

15. And the voice said to him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, do not thou account polluted.

16. This was done thrice, and the vessel was taken up again into heaven.

17. Now while Peter was doubting in himself what might be the meaning of the vision which he had seen, behold the men that were sent from Cornelius, having enquired for Simon's house, stood at the door;

18. and called, and asked, if Simon sirnamed Peter lodged there.

19. And as Peter was pondering upon the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold there are three men enquiring for thee:

20. arise therefore and go down, and go along with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them.

21. Then Peter went down to the men that were sent to him from Cornelius, and said, Behold I am the person whom ye seek: what is the cause for which ye are come?

22. And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a righteous man, and one that feareth God, and of a good character among all the nation of the Jews, hath been warned from God by an holy angel, to send for thee to his house, and to hear what thou shalt say.

23. Then he invited them in, and entertained them that night. And on the morrow Peter set out with them; and some of the brethren from Joppa went with him.

24. And the next day they came into Cesarea; and Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relations and intimate friends.

25. And as Peter came in, Cornelius met him, and falling down at his feet did him reverence.

26. But Peter raised him up, saying, I myself also am a man.

27. And as he was conversing with him, he went in, and found many assembled together.

28. And he said unto them, Ye know how unlawful it is for a man that is a Jew, to associate with or go to the house of one of another nation: but God hath shewn me, that I should not call any man polluted or unclean.

29. And therefore I came to you, when I was sent for, without demur. I ask therefore on what account ye sent for me.

30. And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting till this hour, and at the ninth hour I was praying in my house, when behold a man stood before me in bright raiment,

31. and said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are remembered before God.

32. Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, who is sirnamed Peter, (he lodgeth in the house of one Simon a tanner, by the sea-side,) who when he cometh, will talk with thee.

33. Immediately therefore I sent to thee, and thou hast done well that thou art come. And now we are all here present before God, to hear all the things which God hath charged thee with to us.

34. Then Peter opened his mouth and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:

35. but in every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to Him.

36. According to the declaration which He made to the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.

37. Ye know the report that was spread through all Judea, having begun from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached: concerning Jesus of Nazareth,

38. how God anointed Him with the holy Spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed by the devil: for God was with Him.

39. And we are witnesses of all things that He did, both in the country of Judea, and in the city of Jerusalem: whom notwithstanding they put to death, hanging Him on a tree.

40. Him God raised up the third day, and gave Him to be seen openly; not to all the people,

41. but to witnesses before appointed by God, even to us, who did eat and drink with Him, after He rose from the dead.

42. And He commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is He who is appointed by God to be judge of the living and of the dead.

43. To Him do all the prophets bear witness, that whosoever believeth on Him shall receive the forgiveness of their sins through his name.

44. While Peter was yet speaking these words, the holy Spirit fell upon all them that heard the word.

45. And those of the circumcision that were believers, who came with Peter, were astonished, that the gift of the holy Spirit was conferred upon the Gentiles also:

46. for they heard them speaking in divers languages, and glorifying God.

47. Then said Peter, Can any one forbid water, that these persons should not be baptized, who have received the holy Spirit, as well as we?

48. And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. And they desired him to stay there some days. 

## Acts 11

1. Now the apostles and brethren that were in Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.

2. And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, those that were of the circumcision contended with him, saying,

3. Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised and didst eat with them.

4. But Peter began and laid the matter in order before them,

5. saying, I was praying in the city of Joppa; and in a trance I saw a vision, some thing like a large sheet descending from heaven, let down by the four corners; and it came close to me.

6. And looking stedfastly upon it, I observed four-footed creatures and wild beasts, and reptiles, and fowls of the air.

7. And I heard a voice saying to me, Rise, Peter, kill and eat.

8. But I said, By no means, Lord: for nothing polluted or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth.

9. And the voice answered me a second time from heaven, What God hath cleansed do not thou call polluted.

10. And this was done thrice: and then they were all drawn up again to heaven.

11. And behold at that very time there came three men to the house where I was, sent from Cesarea to me.

12. And the Spirit ordered me to go with them, doubting nothing. And these six brethren also came with me, and we entred into the man's house;

13. and he told us how he had seen an angel in his house, standing and saying to him, Send men to Joppa, and fetch hither Simon,

14. whose sirname is Peter, who will tell thee things, by which thou shalt be saved and all thy family.

15. And when I began to speak, the holy Spirit fell on them, even as it did upon us at the beginning.

16. Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the holy Spirit.

17. As therefore God gave to them the like gift that He did to us, upon our believing on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I should be able to withstand God?

18. And when they heard these things they acquiesced, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God given to the Gentiles also repentance unto life.

19. Now they that were dispersed by the trouble, which arose about Stephen, travelled as far as Phenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but the Jews only.

20. But some of them were Cyprians, and Cyrenians, who when they came to Antioch, discoursed with the Grecians also, preaching the Lord Jesus.

21. And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.

22. And the report of these things came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem; and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.

23. Who, when he was come, and saw the grace of God, rejoiced, and exhorted them all with steadiness of heart to adhere to the Lord.

24. For he was a good man, and full of the holy Spirit, and of faith: and many were added unto the Lord.

25. Then Barnabas departed to Tarsus, to seek Saul: and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch.

26. And they assembled in the church a whole year, and taught much people: and the disciples were first called Christians at Antioch.

27. And in these days came down prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.

28. And one of them, named Agabus, stood up and signified by the Spirit, that there would be a great famine over all the earth: which accordingly came to pass in the reign of Claudius Cesar.

29. And each of the disciples, according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brethren who dwelt in Judea.

30. Which they also did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul. 

## Acts 12

1. About that time Herod the king exerted his power to distress some of the church.

2. And he cut off James, the brother of John, with the sword.

3. And seeing that it was pleasing to the Jews, he proceeded to apprehend Peter also, (in the days of unleavened bread:)

4. whom he seized and put into prison, delivering him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him; intending, after the passover, to bring him out to the people.

5. Peter was therefore kept in custody: but incessant prayer was made to God for him by the church.

6. And when Herod was about to bring him forth, that very night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the guards at the door watched the prison.

7. And behold an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the room; and smiting Peter on the side, he waked him, and said, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.

8. And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself and tie on thy sandals: and he did so. And he saith unto him, Throw thy garment round thee, and follow me.

9. So he went out and followed him; and he did not know, that what was done by the angel was real, but thought he saw a vision.

10. And passing through the first and second guard, they came to the iron gate, that leadeth into the city, which of its own accord opened to them: and they went out and passed on through one street; and then the angel departed from him.

11. And Peter being come to himself said, Now I know truly, that the Lord hath sent his angel and hath delivered me from the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.

12. And considering with himself, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, who was sirnamed Mark, where many were gathered together and praying.

13. And when Peter knocked at the door of the porch, a servant named Rhoda came to ask who was there.

14. And knowing Peter's voice, through excess of joy she did not open the door, but ran in and told them, that Peter was standing at the door.

15. And they said to her, Thou art mad: but she confidently affirmed that it was so. Then said they, It is his angel.

16. But Peter continued knocking; and when they opened the door, they saw him, and were astonished.

17. But he made a sign to them with his hand to be silent, and related to them, how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go, tell these things to James and to the other brethren. And he departed and went to another place.

18. Now as soon as it was day, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.

19. And Herod searching for him, and not finding him, brought the keepers to a trial, and ordered them to be executed. Then he went down from Judea to Cesarea, and abode there.

20. And Herod was going to make war upon the Tyrians and Sidonians: but they came to him with one consent, and making interest with Blastus the king's chamberlain, they sued for peace; because their territory was supplied with provision by the king's country.

21. And upon a set day, Herod arrayed in his royal robes, and sitting upon his throne, made an oration to them.

22. And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man:

23. but immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and being devoured by worms he died.

24. But the word of God grew and was multiplied.

25. And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their charge, taking along with them John who was sirnamed Mark. 

## Acts 13

1. Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers, as Barnabas, and Simeon called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenean, and Manaen who had been educated with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul;

2. and as they were ministring to the Lord, and fasting, the holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul, for the work to which I have called them.

3. Then having fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them they sent them away.

4. These therefore being sent forth by the holy Spirit came down to Seleucia, and from thence they sailed away to Cyprus.

5. And when they arrived at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John for their assistant.

6. And going quite through the island even to Paphos, they found there a certain magician, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus.

7. Who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an understanding man: who calling for Barnabas and Saul, desired to hear the word of God.

8. But Elymas the magician (for so his name signifies) withstood them endeavouring to turn away the proconsul from the faith.

9. Then Saul, who also is called Paul, being filled with the holy Spirit, and looking earnestly at him,

10. said, O thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, who art full of all deceit and craft, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?

11. And now behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing even the sun for a time. And immediately there fell upon him a mist and darkness; and groping about he sought for somebody to lead him by the hand.

12. Then the proconsul, seeing what was done, believed, being struck with admiration at the doctrine of the Lord.

13. Now Paul and those that were with him loosing from Paphos, came to Perga in Pamphylia: but John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.

14. And they passing on from Perga came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, and sat down.

15. And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation to the people, deliver it.

16. Then Paul stood up, and made a sign with his hand, and said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.

17. ---The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and raised the people, while they sojourned in the land of Egypt, and with mighty power brought them out of it.

18. And about forty years He bare with their behaviour in the wilderness.

19. And destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, He gave them their country for an inheritance.

20. And after these things, about the space of four hundred and fifty years, He gave them judges till Samuel the prophet.

21. And then they desired a king: and God gave them Saul the Son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for the space of forty years.

22. And having removed him, He raised up David for their king, to whom also He gave testimony and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, who will perform all my will.

23. Of this man's seed, according to the promise, hath God raised up to Israel Jesus the Saviour:

24. John having preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.

25. And as John was fulfilling his course, he said, Whom do ye take me to be? I am not He: but behold there cometh one after me, the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to unloose.

26. ---Men and brethren, children of the race of Abraham, and all those among you that fear God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.

27. For the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and their rulers, not knowing Him, have indeed fulfilled the words of the prophets, which are read every sabbath-day, in condemning Him.

28. And though they found in Him no capital offence, yet they desired of Pilate that He might be put to death.

29. And when they had finished all things that were written concerning Him, they took Him down from the cross and laid Him in a tomb.

30. But God raised Him from the dead:

31. and He was seen for many days by those that came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.

32. And we bring you good tidings,

33. that the promise made unto the fathers God hath fulfilled unto us their children, having raised up Jesus again: as it is also written in the second psalm, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee."

34. And that He raised Him from the dead, no more to return to the place of corruption, He hath said thus, "I will give you the sure mercies of David."

35. Wherefore he saith also in another place, Thou wilt not suffer thine holy One to see corruption.

36. Now David having served his own generation according to the will of God, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers, and saw corruption: but He whom God raised,

37. did not see corruption.

38. Be it known therefore unto you, brethren, that through Him is preached unto you the remission of sins:

39. and by Him every one that believeth is justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.

40. Beware therefore, least what is spoken in the prophets come upon you,

41. "Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and vanish; for I do a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though any one should declare it unto you."

42. As they went out of the synagogue of the Jews, the Gentiles desired that these words might be spoken to them on the following sabbath.

43. And when the synagogue was broken up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who addressing themselves to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.

44. And on the next sabbath almost all the city came together to hear the word of God.

45. But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, opposing and reviling him.

46. Then Paul and Barnabas boldly said, It was necessary that the word of God should be first spoken to you; but since ye reject it, and judge not yourselves worthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles:

47. for so the Lord hath commanded us, saying, "I have appointed thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the utmost part of the earth."

48. And when the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were determined for eternal life believed.

49. And the word of the Lord was spread through the whole country:

50. but the Jews stirred up devout and honorable women, and the heads of the city, and raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their territories.

51. But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.

52. And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the holy Spirit. 

## Acts 14

1. And at Iconium they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great number both of the Jews and of the Greeks believed.

2. But the unbelieving Jews stirred up and inflamed the minds of the Gentiles against the brethren.

3. They therefore stayed a considerable time speaking freely of the Lord, who bare witness to the word of his grace, and gave signs and wonders to be done by their hands.

4. But the multitude of the city was divided: and some were for the Jews, and some for the apostles:

5. but when there was an effort both of the Gentiles and of the Jews, together with their rulers, to offer violence to them, and to stone them;

6. being apprised of it they fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the adjacent country:

7. and there they preached the gospel.

8. And there was sitting at Lystra, a man disabled in his feet, who had never walked at all, being lame from his birth.

9. This man heard Paul speaking; who looking earnestly at him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,

10. said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped up, and walked.

11. And the people, seeing what Paul had done, lifted up their voice, saying in the Lycaonian tongue, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.

12. And they called Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercury; because he was the chief speaker.

13. And the priest of Jupiter, whose image was before the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and with the people would have offered sacrifices to them.

14. But the apostles Barnabas and Paul, when they heard of it, rent their clothes, and ran in among the people,

15. crying out, and saying, "Sirs, why do ye these things? we also are men subject to the like infirmities with you, and we preach the gospel unto you, that ye may turn from these vanities to the living God, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea,

16. and all things therein, who in generations past suffered all the nations to walk in their own ways: though He left not Himself without witness;

17. for He did us good, in giving us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."

18. And saying these things, they with difficulty restrained the people from sacrificing to them.

19. But there came thither some Jews from Antioch and Iconium, and persuading the multitude, stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.

20. But when the disciples were gathered round him, he rose up and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.

21. And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and Iconium, and Antioch;

22. confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and telling them that through many afflictions we must enter into the kingdom of God.

23. And when they had appointed them elders in every church, praying and fasting, they recommended them to the Lord, in whom they had believed.

24. And passing through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.

25. And when they had preached the word at Perga, they went down to Attalia.

26. And from thence they sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God, for the work which they had now fulfilled.

27. And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they related what God had done by them, and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.

28. And they spent a considerable time there with the disciples. 

## Acts 15

1. Now some that came down from Judea, taught the brethren, saying, Except ye be circumcised according to the law of Moses, ye cannot be saved.

2. A dissension therefore arising, and Paul and Barnabas having no small dispute with them, it was resolved that Paul and Barnabas, and some others, should go up to the apostles and elders at Jerusalem about this question.

3. They therefore, being brought forward on their way by the church, passed through Phenicia and Samaria, relating the conversion of the Gentiles: and they gave great joy to all the brethren.

4. And when they came to Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and by the apostles and elders, and they told them all that God had done by them.

5. But there rose up, said they, some of the sect of the pharisees that believed, saying, that it was necessary to circumcise them, and enjoin them to keep the law of Moses.

6. So the apostles and elders were assembled together to consider about this matter.

7. And after much debate, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Brethren, ye know that a good while ago, God, who was among us, chose that the Gentiles should hear by my mouth the word of the gospel, and believe.

8. And God who knoweth the heart, bare witness to them, giving them the holy Spirit, as He had done also to us:

9. and made no difference between us and them, having purified their hearts by faith.

10. Now therefore why do ye tempt God, in imposing a yoke on the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?

11. But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, in like manner as they.

12. And all the multitude kept silence, and gave attention to Barnabas and Paul, relating what signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.

13. And after they had done speaking, James rose up and said, Brethren, hearken unto me.

14. ---Simeon hath related, how God at first condescended to take out of the Gentiles a people to his name.

15. And to this agree the words of the prophets,

16. as it is written, "After this will I return, and rebuild the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will repair its ruins, and set it up again.

17. That the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, even all the nations, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord who doth all these things."

18. Now all his works are known unto God from the beginning of the world:

19. wherefore my advice is, not to trouble those who from among the Gentiles are converted to God; but to write to them,

20. that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.

21. For Moses hath had from ancient times those that preach him in every city, and is still read in the synagogues every sabbath-day.

22. Then it seemed good to the apostles, and elders, and the whole church, to send men chose from among themselves to Antioch along with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas sirnamed Barsabas, and Silas; leading men among the brethren:

23. and they wrote by their hand, as follows, The apostles and elders and brethren here to the Gentile brethren which are in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, send greeting.

24. Forasmuch as we have heard, that some who went out from us, have troubled you by their discourses, unsettling your minds, saying, ye must be circumcised, and keep the law; to whom we gave no such commission;

25. it seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you, with our beloved brethren Barnabas and Paul,

26. who have exposed their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

27. We have therefore sent with them Judas and Silas, to tell you the same things also by word of mouth.

28. For it seemed good to the holy Spirit, and so to us, to lay no more burthen upon you than these necessary things.

29. That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from fornication: from which ye will do well to keep yourselves. Farewel.

30. Being thus dispatched they came to Antioch, and when they had assembled the brethren, they delivered the epistle.

31. And when they had read it, they rejoiced at the consolation it brought.

32. And Judas and Silas being prophets also themselves, exhorted and established: the brethren by many discourses.

33. And after some time, they were dismissed with peace from the brethren to the apostles.

34. But it seemed good to Silas to continue there: Paul also and Barnabas stayed at Antioch,

35. teaching and preaching, with many others likewise, the word of the Lord.

36. And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, Let us return and visit our brethren in every city, where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they are.

37. And Barnabas proposed to take with them John, who was surnamed Mark.

38. But Paul did not think proper to take him with them, who left them in Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.

39. And there was a sharp dispute, so that they separated from each other; and Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus: but Paul chose Silas and departed,

40. being recommended to the grace of God.

41. And he went through Syria and Cilicia confirming the churches. 

## Acts 16

1. Then he came to Derbe and Lystra: and behold there was a certain disciple there, named Timothy, the son of a believing Jewess, but of a Grecian father.

2. Who was well spoken of by the brethren at Lystra and Iconium:

3. wherefore Paul was desirous that he should go forth with him, and took and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those parts; for they all knew that his father was a Greek.

4. And as they passed through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees that had been made by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem.

5. And so the churches were established in the faith, and increased in number daily.

6. And when they had passed through Phrygia and Galatia, being forbidden by the holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia, they came to Mysia, and endeavoured to go to Bithynia:

7. but the Spirit suffered them not.

8. So they passed by Mysia, and came down to Troas.

9. And Paul saw a vision in the night, There stood a certain man of Macedonia, intreating him and saying, Come over into Macedonia and help us.

10. And as soon as he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to depart into Macedonia, concluding that the Lord called us to preach the gospel to them.

11. Therefore we set sail from Troas, and came in a direct course to Samothracia, and the day following to Neapolis;

12. and from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a Roman colony. And we staid some time in this city.

13. And on the sabbath-day we went out of the city to a river-side, where there used to be prayer: and we sat down and preached to the women that resorted thither.

14. And a certain woman named Lydia, a purple-seller of the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things that were spoken by Paul.

15. And when she was baptized and her family, she requested us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and lodge there. And she constrained us.

16. Now as we were going to the place of prayer, there met us a young woman that had a spirit of divination, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.

17. She following Paul and us, cried out, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, who shew us the way of salvation.

18. And this she did for many days. But Paul being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.

19. And he came out that instant. And when her masters saw, that the hope of their gain was gone, they seized on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the court to the magistrates.

20. And when they brought them to the governors, they said, These men cause great disturbance in our city, for they are Jews, and teach customs,

21. which it is not lawful for us to receive, nor practise, who are Romans.

22. And the populace rose up together against them: and the officers stripped off their clothes, and ordered them to be scourged.

23. And when they had given them many stripes, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely.

24. Who having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.

25. Now in the middle of the night Paul and Silas were praying and singing praises to God, and the prisoners heard them.

26. And on a sudden there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bonds were loosed.

27. The jailor waking, and seeing the prison-doors open, drew his sword and was going to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners were fled.

28. But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.

29. Then he called for lights, and sprang in, and being in a tremor fell down before Paul and Silas:

30. and bringing them out, he said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?

31. And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thine house.

32. And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all in his family.

33. And he took them at that very time of the night, and bathed their stripes: and was baptized, he and all his immediately after.

34. And he brought them into his house, and spread a table for them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his household.

35. And when it was the day the governors sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.

36. And the jailor told these words to Paul, saying, the governors have sent orders, that you should be discharged; now therefore depart, and go in peace.

37. But Paul said unto them, They have publicly beaten us, uncondemned, and Romans, and cast us into prison, and do they now turn us out privately? No verily, let them come themselves and fetch us out.

38. And the serjeants reported these words to the governors: and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.

39. And they came and intreated them, and when they had brought them out, they desired them to leave the city.

40. And when they were come out of the prison, they went into the house of Lydia: and seeing the brethren, they comforted them, and departed. 

## Acts 17

1. Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.

2. And according to his custom Paul went in among them, and for three sabbath-days discoursed to them from the scriptures;

3. opening them and shewing, that the Messiah was to suffer and rise again from the dead: and that this is the Christ even, Jesus, whom, said he, I preach unto you.

4. And some of them believed and joined themselves to Paul and Silas, and a great number of the devout Greeks, and of the women of distinction not a few.

5. But the unbelieving Jews being filled with envy, collected some loose profligate fellows, and making a tumult set all the city in an uproar: and assaulting Jason's house, they sought for them in order to bring them out to the populace.

6. But not finding them, they dragged Jason and some of the brethren to the rulers of the city, crying out, these men that have turned the world upside down,

7. are come hither also, and Jason has privately received them. And they all act contrary to the decrees of Cesar, saying, there is another king, one Jesus.

8. And they alarmed the people, and the rulers of the city upon hearing these things:

9. but they taking security of Jason and the rest, let them go.

10. And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea: who, when they were come thither, went into the synagogue of the Jews.

11. These were more ingenuous than those at Thessalonica; for they received the word with all readiness of mind, searching the scriptures daily, whether these things were so.

12. And therefore many of them believed: and of the Grecian women of quality, and of men likewise not a few.

13. But when the Jews of Thessalonica knew that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came thither also, to stir up the people.

14. Then the brethren immediately sent away Paul towards the sea: but Silas and Timothy remained there.

15. And they that conducted Paul attended him to Athens: and receiving an order to Silas and Timothy, to come to him as soon as possible, they departed.

16. Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his Spirit was greatly moved, when he saw the city wholly given up to idolatry.

17. He therefore disputed in the synagogue with the Jews and other devout persons on the sabbath-day, and with whomsoever he met in public every day.

18. But some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him; and some said, What would this babler say? and others, He seemeth to be a proclaimer of foreign deities: because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.

19. And they took and brought him to the Areopagus, and said, May we know what this new doctrine is, of which thou speakest?

20. For thou bringest strange things to our ears; we would therefore know what these things mean.

21. (Now all the Athenians, and strangers sojourning among them, spent their time in nothing else, but to tell or to hear something new.)

22. Then Paul stood up in the midst of the Areopagus and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that you are indeed over-much religious:

23. for as I was passing along, and looking at what ye worshipped, I found an altar on which there was inscribed, "To the unknown God." Whom therefore ye worship unknown, Him do I declare unto you.

24. The God that made the world and all things therein, being lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands:

25. nor is He served by the hands of men, as needing any thing: for He giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;

26. and hath made of one blood every nation of men to dwell upon all the face of the earth, having determined the seasons before-appointed them, and the bounds of their habitation;

27. that they might seek the Lord, if possibly they might trace Him, and find Him: though indeed He is not far from every one of us.

28. For in Him we live and move, and exist; as some also of your own poets have said, "For we his offspring are."

29. Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to imagine that the Deity is like to gold, or silver, or stone, carved by the art and device of man.

30. Wherefore though God overlooked the times of this ignorance, He now requireth all men every where to repent.

31. Because He hath fixed a day, in which He will judge the world in righteousness, by that man whom He hath appointed thereto; having given assurance of it to all men, by raising Him from the dead.

32. And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some laughed at it: and others said, We will hear thee again concerning this matter.

33. So Paul went out of the assembly.

34. Some however adhered to him, and believed: among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them. 

## Acts 18

1. After these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth.

2. And finding there a certain Jew, named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who was lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, (because Claudius Cesar had ordered all the Jews to depart from Rome,) he went to them;

3. and as he was of the same trade, he staid and worked with them: for they were tent-makers.

4. And he discoursed in the synagogue every sabbath-day, and persuaded both Jews and Greeks.

5. And when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was very urgent in spirit, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.

6. But as they opposed and blasphemed, he shook his garment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clear of it: from henceforth I will go to the Gentiles.

7. And departing thence, he went to the house of one named Justus, who worshipped God, whose house was contiguous to the synagogue.

8. But Crispus the ruler of the synagogue believed on the Lord with all his house: and many of the Corinthians hearing the word believed, and were baptized.

9. And the Lord said to Paul by a vision in the night, "Fear not, but speak: and be not silent:

10. for I am with thee, and no man shall lay hands on thee to hurt thee; for I have much people in this city."

11. And he staid a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God.

12. But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose against Paul, and brought him to the seat of justice,

13. saying, this fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.

14. And when Paul was going to speak, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were indeed an act of injustice, or some wicked crime, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you.

15. But if it be a question about words, and names, and your law, settle it yourselves; for I will be no judge of these matters.

16. And he ordered them away from the tribunal.

17. Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him even before the tribunal: but Gallio did not concern himself about the matter.

18. And after Paul had staid there yet a considerable time, he took leave of the brethren, and sailed from thence to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, after he had shaved his head at Cenchrea; for he had a vow.

19. And he came to Esphesus, and left them there: but before his departure he himself went into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.

20. Though when they desired him to stay longer with them, he did not consent: but took his leave of them,

21. saying, I must by all means keep the approaching feast at Jerusalem; but I will return to you again, God willing. So he sailed from Ephesus;

22. and landing at Cesarea, went up to Jerusalem, and after he had saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.

23. And when he had spent some time there, he departed, and went in order through the country of Galatia and Phrygia strengthening all the disciples.

24. Now there came to Ephesus a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures.

25. Who had been instructed in the way of our Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught clearly the things of the Lord, though he knew only the baptism of John.

26. And as he began to speak openly in the synagogue, Aquila and Priscilla heard him and took him home, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.

27. And as he was inclined to go into Achaia, the brethren wrote to the disciples exhorting them to receive him: who when he arrived, was very helpful to those who had believed through grace.

28. For he disputed vehemently with the Jews in public, proving by the scriptures, that Jesus was the Christ. 

## Acts 19

1. Now it came to pass while Apollos was at Corinth, that Paul having passed through the upper parts of Asia came to Ephesus:

2. and finding some disciples there, he said unto them, Have ye received the holy Spirit since ye embraced the faith? And they said unto him, Nay, we had not even heard whether the holy Spirit be yet given.

3. And he said unto them, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into the baptism of John.

4. Then said Paul, John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people, that they should believe in Him that was coming after him, that is, in Christ Jesus.

5. And when they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.

6. And as Paul laid his hands on them, the holy Spirit came upon them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied. And the men were in all about twelve.

7. And he went into the synagogue,

8. and spake boldly, disputing with them for the space of three months, and persuading them of the things concerning the kingdom of God.

9. But as some were hardened and refractory, speaking evil of the way of life before the multitude, he departed from them, and took away the disciples with him, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.

10. And this he did for two years; so that all the inhabitants of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord Jesus.

11. And God wrought extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul:

12. so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were brought from his body to the sick, and the diseases lest them, and evil spirits went out of them.

13. Then some of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to name the name of the Lord Jesus over those that had evil spirits, saying, "We adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth."

14. Now there were seven sons of one Sceva a Jewish priest, who did this.

15. But the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye?

16. And the man in whom the evil spirit was, leapt upon them, and mastered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.

17. And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.

18. And many of them that believed came confessing and declaring their former practices.

19. And a great number of those that had used inquisitive arts, brought the books, and burned them before them all: and they computed the price of them, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.

20. So mightily did the word of the Lord increase and prevail.

21. After these things, Paul purposed in spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia, and go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.

22. So he sent into Macedonia two of those that ministred to him, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself stayed some time in Asia.

23. Now there happened at that time no small disturbance about the way which he taught.

24. For one Demetrius, a silver-smith, who made silver models of Diana's temple, brought no small gain to the artificers: whom he got together,

25. and with them the workmen they employed about such things, and said, My friends, ye know that by this employment we get our wealth.

26. And ye see and hear, that not only at Ephesus, but in almost all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and perverted many people, saying, that they are no gods which are made by hands.

27. So that we are not only in danger of this, that the business we follow will come to nothing; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana will be despised; and her magnificence destroyed, whom all Asia and the whole world worshippeth.

28. Hearing this and being filled with rage, they cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

29. And the whole city was filled with confusion: and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus two Macedonians, fellow-travellers with Paul.

30. And when Paul would have gone in unto the people, the disciples would not let him.

31. And some also of the chief men of Asia, being his friends, sent to him and desired him not to venture himself into the theatre.

32. Some therefore cried one thing, and some another; for the assembly was confused, and the greater part did not know for what they were come together.

33. And they brought Alexander forward out of the multitude, the Jews urging him on. And Alexander beckoning with the hand, would have made a defence to the people.

34. But when they knew that he was a Jew, they all cried out with one voice, for near two hours, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

35. And when the Secretary had appeased the multitude, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there who doth not know that the city of the Ephesians is devoted to the service of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?

36. Since therefore these things are incontestible, ye ought to be quiet and composed, and to do nothing rashly.

37. For ye have brought these men hither, who are neither robbers of temples, nor blasphemers of your goddess.

38. If Demetrius therefore, and the artificers that are with him, have a charge against any one, the law-courts are open, and there are Roman proconsuls likewise: let them implead one another.

39. But if ye are enquiring any thing about other matters, let it be decided in a lawful assembly:

40. for we are in danger of being charged with sedition for what has happened this day, there being no cause by which we can give a reason for this concourse.

41. And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly. 

## Acts 20

1. And after the tumult was over, Paul sent for the disciples to him, and having embraced them, departed to go into Macedonia.

2. And having passed through those parts, and given them much exhortation, he came into Greece.

3. And when he had spent three months there, the Jews having laid wait for him as he was going to embark for Syria, he determined to return by Macedonia.

4. And there accompanied him to Asia, Sopater the Berean, and of the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy: and the Asiatics,

5. Tychicus and Trophimus, who went before and stayed for us at Troas.

6. And after the days of unleavened bread we sailed from Philippi, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we spent seven days.

7. And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples were assembled together to break bread, Paul being about to depart on the morrow, preached unto them, and continued his discourse till midnight.

8. And there were many lamps in the upper room where they were assembled.

9. And a young man named Eutychus, who sat in a window, falling into a deep sleep, as Paul was discoursing for a long time, sunk down and fell from the third story, and was taken up dead.

10. And Paul went down and leaned over him, and took him up and said, Be not disturbed; for his life is in him.

11. Then he went up again, and having broken bread and eaten, and conversed with them a considerable time, even till break of day, he departed.

12. And they brought in the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.

13. But we went before to the ship, and sailed to Assos, being there to take in Paul: for so he had appointed, designing himself to go on foot.

14. And as soon as he joined us at Assos, we took him in and came to Mitylene.

15. And sailing from thence we came the next day over against Chios; and the day following we arrived at Samos, and stopping at Trogyllium, we came the day after to Miletus.

16. For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, that he might not spend time in Asia: for he endeavoured, if it were possible, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.

17. But he sent from Miletus to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.

18. And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know in what manner I behaved among you all the time, from the first day that I came into Asia.

19. Serving the Lord with all humility, and many tears, and trials which befel me by the ambushes of the Jews.

20. And how I with-held nothing that was useful, but have declared it to you, and have taught you publicly and from house to house:

21. testifying both to the Jews and Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.

22. And now, being constrained by the spirit, behold I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will befal me there:

23. save that the holy Spirit testifieth in every city, that bonds and afflictions await me.

24. But none of these things move me, nor do I account my life dear, so that I may finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.

25. And now behold I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.

26. Wherefore I call you to witness this day, that I am clear from the blood of all men.

27. For I have not failed to declare unto you all the counsel of God.

28. Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the holy Spirit hath appointed you bishops, to feed the church of God, which He purchased with his own blood.

29. For I know this, that after my departure grievous wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.

30. And from among yourselves shall men arise, speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them.

31. Watch therefore, remembering that for the space of three years I ceased not by night and by day to warn every one with tears.

32. And now, my brethren, I recommend you to God, and to the word of his grace: who is able to edify you, and to give you an inheritance among all that are sanctified.

33. I have coveted no one's silver, or gold, or apparel:

34. and ye yourselves know that these hands have ministred to my necessities, and to those that were with me.

35. I have shewed you in all things, that by labouring thus ye ought to support the infirm; and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, who said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.

36. And when he had said these things, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.

37. And they were all much grieved, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him: sorrowing most of all at the word which he spake,

38. that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship. 

## Acts 21

1. Now as soon as we had parted from them, and set sail, we came in a strait course to Coos, and the day following to Rhodes, and from thence to Patara.

2. And finding a ship there, which was passing over to Phenicia, we went aboard it, and set sail.

3. And coming in fight of Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed to Syria, and came down to Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade.

4. And we stayed there seven days; having met with some disciples: who told Paul by the Spirit, not to go up to Jerusalem.

5. But when we had completed these days, we departed and went our way, all of them attending us with their wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore and prayed.

6. And having taken leave of each other, we went into the ship, and they returned home.

7. And we finishing our voyage, came down from Tyre to Ptolemais, and saluting the brethren stayed with them one day.

8. On the morrow Paul and those that were with him departed from Ptolemais, and came to Cesarea; and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven deacons, we stayed with him.

9. And he had four daughters virgins, that were prophetesses.

10. And as we abode there several days, there came down from Judea a certain prophet named Agabus:

11. and he came to us, and taking up Paul's girdle, and binding his own hands and feet, he said, Thus saith the holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man whose girdle this is, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.

12. And when we heard these things, both we and those of the place intreated him not to go up to Jerusalem.

13. But Paul answered, What do ye mean, weeping and breaking my heart? for I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.

14. And as he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.

15. And after these days were expired, we packed up our things, and went to Jerusalem.

16. And there went also with us from Cesarea some of the disciples, who brought us to one Mnason a Cyprian, an old disciple, with whom we were to lodge.

17. And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us with joy.

18. And the next day Paul went in with us to James: and all the elders were present.

19. And when he had saluted them, he gave a particular narrative of the things which God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry.

20. And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said to him, Thou seest, brother, how many myriads there are of the believing Jews, and they are all zealous for the law.

21. And they have heard of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews, who are among the Gentiles, to forsake the law of Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, nor to walk after our customs.

22. What then is to be done? The people must necessarily meet together; for they will hear that thou art come.

23. Do this therefore, which we advise thee. Here are four men with us, that have a vow upon them: take these and be purified with them,

24. and join in their expences, that they may shave their head: and that all may know, that there is nothing in what they have heard of thee; but thou thyself walkest according to the law.

25. But as to the believing Gentiles, we have written and determined, that they need observe no such thing; only to keep themselves from what is offered to idols, and from blood, and from any thing strangled, and from fornication.

26. Then Paul took the men, and the next day being purified with them entered into the temple to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification till an offering should be offered for every one of them.

27. But when the seven days were near ended, the Jews that came from Asia seeing him in the temple, raised a tumult among the people, and laid hands on him, crying out, Men of Israel, help:

28. this is the man that teaches all men every where against the people of the Jews, and the law, and this sacred place? and besides, hath brought Greeks too into the temple, and polluted this holy place.

29. (For they had before seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they thought Paul had brought into the temple.)

30. And the whole city was moved, and there was a concourse of the people: and they laid hold on Paul, and dragged him out of the temple; and immediately the gates were shut.

31. And as they were going to kill him, a report came to the tribune of the cohort, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar:

32. who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. And when they saw the chiliarch and the soldiers, they left off beating Paul.

33. Then the commanding officer came near and took him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains; and inquired, who he was, and what he had done.

34. But some in the croud bawled out one thing and some another: and as he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.

35. And when he was upon the stairs, he was even borne by the soldiers, because of the violence of the people.

36. For the multitude followed crying out, Away with him.

37. And as Paul was going to be led into the castle, he said to the tribune, May I be allowed to speak a word to thee? And he said, Canst thou speak Greek?

38. Art not thou that Egyptian, who before this madest a sedition, and didst lead out into the wilderness four thousand murtherers?

39. But Paul said, I am indeed a Jew, a man of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beg thou wouldest permit me to speak to the people.

40. And when he gave him leave, Paul standing on the stairs made a sign with the hand to the people: and there being a great silence made, He spake to them in the Hebrew tongue, saying, 

## Acts 22

1. Brethren, and Fathers, hear now my apology to you,

2. ---(and when they heard that he spake to them in the Hebrew dialect, they the more readily kept silence, and he said,)

3. ---I am indeed a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, but educated in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, accurately instructed in the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, as ye all are this day.

4. And I persecuted those of this persuasion even unto death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.

5. As the high priest is my witness, and all the elders: from whom I received letters to our brethren, and went to Damascus to bring those also, that were there, bound to Jerusalem, to be punished.

6. And it came to pass that as I was on my journey and drew nigh to Damascus, about mid-day, on a sudden a great light from heaven shone round about me:

7. and I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

8. And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And He said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.

9. And they that were with me saw the light indeed, and were affrighted; but they did not hear the voice of Him that spake to me.

10. And I said, Lord, what shall I do? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go on to Damascus, and there it shall be told thee concerning all things which are appointed for thee to do.

11. And as I could not see by reason of the glory of that light, being led by the hand by those that were with me, I came to Damascus.

12. And one Ananias, a devout observer of the law, who had a good character from all the Jews that dwelt there,

13. came to me, and stood by me, and said, Brother Saul, look up: and I immediately looked up upon him.

14. And he said, The God of our Fathers hath before appointed thee to know his will, and to see the just One, and to hear a voice from his mouth.

15. For thou shalt be his witness unto all men, of what thou hast seen and heard.

16. And now why shouldst thou delay? Arise and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling upon the name of the Lord.

17. And when I was returned to Jerusalem, and was praying in the temple, I was in a trance.

18. And I saw Him saying unto me, Make haste and go quickly out of Jerusalem; for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.

19. And I said, Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and scourged in the synagogues them that believed on Thee.

20. And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also stood by and consented to his death, and kept the clothes of them that slew him.

21. But he said unto me, Go away; for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.---

22. And they heard him to this word, and then they exalted their voice, saying, Away with such a fellow from the earth; for it is not fit that he should live.

23. And as they were bawling out, and throwing off their clothes, and casting up dust into the air,

24. the tribune commanded him to be brought into the castle, and ordered him to be put to the question by scourging; that he might know for what reason they so cried out against him.

25. And as they were binding him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, uncondemned?

26. And the centurion hearing this, went and told the tribune, saying, Consider what thou art about to do; for this man is a Roman.

27. Then the tribune came and said to him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? And he said, Yes.

28. And the tribune replied, I obtained this freedom with a large sum of money. And Paul said, But I was free-born.

29. Immediately therefore those who were going to put him to the question quitted him: and the tribune also was afraid, when he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.

30. And on the morrow, desiring to know for certain what he was accused of by the Jews, he loosed him from his bonds, and ordered the chief priests and all their council to attend; and he brought down Paul, and set him before them: 

## Acts 23

1. and Paul looking earnestly at the sanhedrim, said, "Brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God even to this day:"

2. but the high priest Ananias ordered those that stood next him, to smite him on the mouth.

3. Then said Paul to him, "God will smite thee, thou whited wall: dost thou sit to judge me according to the law, and contrary to the law commandest me to be smitten?"

4. But they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high-priest?

5. And Paul said, I was not aware, brethren, that it was the high-priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.

6. But Paul, knowing that the one part were sadducees, and the other pharisees, cried out in the sanhedrim, "Brethren, I am a pharisee, the son of a pharisee: for the hope of a resurrection of the dead I am now prosecuted."

7. Upon his saying this, there rose a contention between the pharisees and the sadducees; and the people were divided.

8. For the sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but the pharisees acknowledge both.

9. So there was a great clamor: and the scribes that were of the party of the pharisees rose up and contended, saying, We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.

10. But as there arose much contention, the tribune fearing least Paul should be torn in pieces by them, ordered a party of soldiers to go down, and take him by force out of the midst of them, and to bring him into the castle.

11. And the following night, the Lord standing by him said, Paul, be of good courage; for as thou hast testified concerning me at Jerusalem, so must thou also bear testimony at Rome.

12. And when it was day, some of the Jews, having formed a conspiracy, bound themselves with a curse, saying, that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.

13. And they were more than forty that had made this oath:

14. who came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, "We have bound ourselves by a curse to eat nothing till we have killed Paul.

15. Now therefore do ye with the rest of the sanhedrim signify to the tribune, that he would bring him down to you to-morrow, as if you would examine more accurately some things concerning him: and we are ready to dispatch him before he come near you."

16. But Paul's sister's son, hearing of the ambush, came and entered into the castle, and told Paul.

17. Then Paul called one of the centurions to him, and said, Introduce this young man to the tribune; for he hath something to tell him.

18. So he took him and brought him to the tribune, and said, Paul the prisoner called me to him, and desired me to introduce this young man unto thee, as having something to say to thee.

19. And the tribune took him by the hand, and retiring into a private apartment asked him, What is it which thou hast to tell me?

20. And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee, that thou wouldest bring down Paul to-morrow to the council, as if they would inquire something more strictly concerning him.

21. But do not thou comply with them: for there lie in wait for him more than forty men of them, who have bound themselves with a curse neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him: and they are now ready, waiting for an order from thee.

22. Then the tribune dismissed the young man, charging him, Tell no one that thou hast discovered these things to me.

23. And he called two of the centurions to him, and said, Get ready two hundred soldiers to go to Cesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, by the third hour of the night.

24. And provide beasts, that they may set Paul on and bring him safe to Felix the governor.

25. And he wrote a letter to this effect:

26. Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.

27. This man being seized by the Jews, and about to be killed by them, I came upon them with some soldiers and rescued him: for I understand that he is a Roman.

28. But desiring to know the cause for which they accused him, I brought him down into their council:

29. and I found he was accused about questions of their law, but had no charge against him deserving death or bonds.

30. But an ambush, which was going to be laid for the man by the Jews, being discovered to me, immediately I sent him to thee, telling his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.

31. The soldiers therefore, according to the orders given them, took up Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.

32. And the next day they returned to the castle, leaving the horsemen to go with him;

33. who, when they came into Cesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.

34. And when the governor had read the letter, and asked of what province he was; being informed that he was of Cilicia, he said,

35. I will hear thee, when thine accusers are also come. And he ordered him to be kept in Herod's palace. 

## Acts 24

1. And after five days, the high-priest Ananias came down with the elders, and one Tertulius an orator, who appeared before the governor against Paul.

2. And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, "As by thee we enjoy much peace, and glorious things are done to this nation by thy prudent administration,

3. we acknowledge it upon all occasions and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.

4. But that I may not trespass upon thee too far, I beg thou wouldst hear us a few words with thy wonted goodness.

5. For having found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ring-leader of the sect of the Nazarenes,

6. and attempting to profane the temple, we apprehended him, and would have judged him according to our law.

7. But Lysias the tribune came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands, commanding his accusers to come unto thee:

8. from whom thou mayst thyself by examining him come to the knowledge of all these things of which we accuse him."

9. And the Jews also assented, saying, that these things were so.

10. Then Paul, when the governor permitted him to speak, answered in this manner, "As I know that thou hast been many years a judge to this nation, I do the more chearfully answer for myself:

11. because thou mayst know, that there are not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem:

12. and they neither found me disputing with any one in the temple, or making sedition among the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:

13. nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.

14. But this I confess unto thee, that after the way, which they call heresy, so do I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law, and the prophets:

15. having hope in God, (which they themselves also expect) that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.

16. And on this account do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence both towards God and towards men.

17. Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.

18. Upon which some Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude nor with tumult:

19. who ought to have been here before thee, and make good their charge, if they had any thing against me.

20. Or let these themselves say, if they found any crime in me, when I stood before the sanhedrim;

21. unless for this one expression, that I cried out when I stood among them, For the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day."

22. And when Felix heard these things he put them off, (for he had been more particularly informed concerning this way of religion,) and said, When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will thoroughly examine your matters.

23. And he commanded the centurion to keep Paul secure, and to let him have some liberty, and to hinder none of his friends from assisting him or coming to him.

24. Some days after Felix coming with his wife Drusilla, a Jewess, sent for Paul, and heard him concerning faith in Christ.

25. And as he was reasoning of justice, temperance, and a future judgement, Felix trembled, and said, Go thy way for this time, and I will take a proper opportunity to call for thee again.

26. And hoping also that money would be given him by Paul, that he might discharge him; he sent for him the more frequently, and conversed with him.

27. But after two years Felix received a successor, Porcius Festus; and being willing to gain favor with the Jews lest Paul confined. 

## Acts 25

1. Festus therefore, being come into the province, after three days went up from Cesarea to Jerusalem.

2. And the high-priest and principal men among the Jews, appeared before him against Paul, and made application to him,

3. begging the favor of him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem; for they were preparing an ambush to kill him by the way.

4. But Festus answered, that Paul was in custody at Cesarea, and that he himself should go thither soon.

5. Therefore, said he, let those of you who are able, go down with me, and if there be any thing bad in this man, let them accuse him.

6. And when he had staid among them more than ten days, he went down to Cesarea, and the next day sitting on the tribunal, he commanded Paul to be brought before him.

7. And when he was come, the Jews that came down from Jerusalem, stood round about, bringing many heavy charges against Paul, which they were not able to prove:

8. he answering in his own defence, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Cesar have I committed any offence.

9. But Festus, being desirous to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Art thou willing to go up to Jerusalem, and there to be tried concerning these things before me?

10. Then said Paul, I stand at Cesar's tribunal, where I ought to be tried: I have done no wrong to the Jews, as thou very well knowest.

11. For if I am indeed doing them wrong, and have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be nothing in what these men accuse me of, no one can give me up to them.

12. I appeal to Cesar. Then Festus, conferring with his council, answered, Hast thou appealed to Cesar? to Cesar thou shalt go.

13. And some days after king Agrippa and Bernice came to Cesarea to salute Festus.

14. And as they spent several days there, Festus related Paul's case to the king, saying, There is a man left in custody by Felix: concerning whom,

15. when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews appeared in court, desiring judgement against him.

16. To whom I answered, it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man to destruction, till he that is accused have the accusers face to face, and have an opportunity of making his defence concerning the accusation.

17. Therefore when they were come hither, making no delay, I sat on the tribunal the next day, and ordered the man to be brought before me.

18. Against whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such things as I supposed they would:

19. but had certain questions against him concerning their own religion; and of one Jesus that was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.

20. But I being in doubt as to the dispute concerning these matters, asked him, if he would go to Jerusalem, and there be tried concerning these things.

21. But when Paul appealed, to be reserved to the hearing of our sovereign, I ordered him to be kept till I could send him to Cesar.

22. Then Agrippa said to Festus, I should be willing to hear the man myself. And he said, thou shalt hear him to-morrow.

23. The next day therefore, Agrippa and Bernice coming with much pomp, and entering into the court, together with the chief officers, and men of greatest eminence in the city, at the command of Festus Paul was brought in.

24. And Festus said, "King Agrippa and all that are here present with us, ye see this man, concerning whom all the Jews have applied to me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying out, that he ought not to live.

25. But when I found that he had done nothing worthy of death, and as he himself has appealed to the emperor, I have determined to send him.

26. Concerning whom I have nothing certain to write to our sovereign: wherefore I have brought him out before you, and especially before thee, O king Agrippa, that after examination is made I may have somewhat to write.

27. For it seems to me absurd, to send a prisoner and not to signify the crimes laid against him." 

## Acts 26

1. Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretching forth his hand, thus made his defence,

2. "O king Agrippa, I think myself happy, that I am this day to make my defence before thee, concerning all the things which I am accused of by the Jews:

3. especially as thou art acquainted with all the customs and questions which are among the Jews; wherefore I intreat thee to hear me patiently.

4. My manner of life then from my youth, as it has been from the beginning among my own nation at Jerusalem, all the Jews are acquainted with,

5. knowing me before, (if they would testify it,) that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a pharisee.

6. And now I stand arraigned for the hope of the promise which was made by God to our fathers:

7. to which promise our twelve tribes, worshipping continually night and day, hope to attain: concerning which hope, O king Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.

8. What! is it judged incredible by you, that God should raise the dead?

9. I indeed once thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus the Nazarene:

10. which I also did in Jerusalem; and I shut up many of the saints in prison, having received authority for it from the chief priests; and when they were put to death I gave my voice against them.

11. And often punishing them in all the synagogues, I compelled them to blaspheme, and being excessively enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.

12. On which accounts as I was going to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests---at mid-day,

13. O king, as I was on the way thither I saw a light from heaven exceeding the splendor of the sun, shining round about me and those that were going with me.

14. And when we were all fallen down to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goads.

15. And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And He said, I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest.

16. But rise, and stand on thy feet: for to this end have I appeared unto thee, to appoint thee a minister and a witness both of the things which thou hast seen, and of those for which I shall hereafter appear unto thee:

17. delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles, to whom I now send thee,

18. to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of satan unto God; that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me.

19. Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision:

20. but declared first to those in Damascus and Jerusalem, and through all the country of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent, and turn unto God, performing works suitable to repentance.

21. For these things the Jews seized me in the temple, and attempted to kill me.

22. But having obtained help of God, I continue until this day, testifying both to small and great, and saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses declared should come to pass; even that the Messiah should suffer,

23. and being the first of the resurrection from the dead should bring light to the people and to the Gentiles."

24. And as he was saying these things in his defence, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself: much learning turns thy brain.

25. But he replied, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but I speak the words of truth and of a sound mind.

26. For the king knoweth of these things, to whom also I speak with freedom; because I am persuaded that none of them are unknown to him; for this was not done in a corner.

27. O king Agrippa, believest thou the prophets?

28. I know that thou believest them. Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou almost persuadest me to be a Christian.

29. And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.

30. And when he had said this, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and those that sat with them.

31. And when they were retired, they spake to each other, saying, this man hath done nothing worthy of death or of bonds.

32. And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Cesar. 

## Acts 27

1. Now as it was determined that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan cohort.

2. And going on board a ship of Adramyttium, we went off, intending to sail by the coasts of Asia; Aristarchus a Macedonian of Thessalonica being with us.

3. And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius treating Paul with great humanity, permitted him to go to his friends to get proper supplies.

4. And when we departed from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.

5. And sailing through the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra a city of Lycia.

6. And there the centurion finding a ship of Alexandria bound for Italy, he put us on board it.

7. And as we sailed slowly for many days, and were hardly got on to Cnidus, the wind not permitting us, we sailed under Crete by Salmone.

8. And passing it with difficulty, we came to a place called the Fair-havens, near to which was the city of Lasea.

9. And as much time was spent, and sailing was now dangerous, (for the fast was now past,) Paul exhorted them,

10. saying, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage is like to be prejudicial and with much damage, not only of the lading and of the ship, but also of our lives.

11. But the centurion regarded the pilot and the master of the vessel, more than the things that were said by Paul.

12. And the haven not being commodious to winter in, the greater part advised to sail from thence, if they could possibly reach to Phenice to winter at that haven of Crete, which looks both to the south-west and north-west.

13. And as the south wind blew gently, thinking they were secure of their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed close by Crete.

14. But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind called Euroclydon.

15. And the ship being hurried on, and not able to face the wind, we gave it up and so were carried along.

16. And running under a certain island called Clauda, we were hardly able to become masters of the boat.

17. Which when they had hoisted up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and fearing least they should fall into the quick-sands, they struck fail, and so were driven.

18. And as we were exceedingly tossed by the storm, the next day they lightened the ship:

19. and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship too.

20. And as neither sun nor stars appeared for several days, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope of our being saved was now taken away.

21. But after long abstinence from food, Paul stood up in the midst of them and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not loosed from Crete, and so have saved this damage and loss.

22. However, I now exhort you to be of good courage: for there shall be no loss of any life among you, but only of the ship:

23. for there stood by me this night an angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, saying,

24. Fear not, Paul, thou must be brought before Cesar, and behold God hath given thee all that are sailing with thee.

25. Wherefore, Sirs, be of good courage; for I trust in God, that it shall be so, according as it was told me.

26. But we must be cast upon some island.

27. And when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic sea, about the middle of the night the mariners thought they drew near to some land:

28. and sounding they found it twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little farther, and sounded again, they found it fifteen fathoms.

29. Then fearing least they should fall upon some rocky places, they cast four anchors out of the stern and wished for day.

30. But the mariners endeavouring to flee out of the ship, and having let down the boat into the sea, under pretence that they were going to stretch out anchors from the head of the ship,

31. Paul said to the centurion, and to the soldiers, Unless these men stay in the ship ye cannot be saved.

32. Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off.

33. And while the day was coming on, Paul exhorted them all to take some food, saying, Fourteen days this day ye continue waiting without proper food, having taken nothing:

34. wherefore I exhort you to take some nourishment, for this is necessary for your safety: for there shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you.

35. And having spoken thus, he took bread and gave thanks to God in presence of them all, and when he had broken it he began to eat.

36. And being all encouraged they also took some food.

37. And we were in all in the ship two hundred and seventy-six souls.

38. And when they were satisfied with food, they lightened the ship and cast out the corn into the sea.

39. And when it was day, they did not know the land near them: but they perceived a certain creek with a shore, into which they were desirous, if they could, to have thrust the ship.

40. And when they had taken up the anchors, they trusted the ship to the sea, at the same time, loosing the rudder-bands; and hoisting up the main-sail to the wind, they made to the shore.

41. But falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship a-ground; and the fore-part stuck fast, and remained immoveable, but the hinder part was dashed in pieces by the violence of the waves.

42. And the counsel of the soldiers was to kill the prisoners, least any of them should swim out and escape.

43. But the centurion, desirous to save Paul, hindered them from their purpose, and ordered those that could swim to throw themselves out first, and get off to land:

44. and the rest, some on planks, and others on some other things out of the ship. And so it came to pass that they all got safe to land. 

## Acts 28

1. And when they were safe on shore, they understood, that the island was called Melita.

2. And the barbarians shewed us uncommon humanity: for they kindled a fire and took us all in, because of the present rain, and of the cold.

3. And Paul having gathered together a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came out a viper from the heat, and fastened on his hand.

4. And when the barbarians saw the venomous creature hanging on his hand, they said to one another, This man is certainly a murderer, whom, though he hath been saved from the sea, yet justice suffereth not to live.

5. But he shook off the creature into the fire, and suffered no hurt.

6. They however were expecting that he would swell, or suddenly fall down dead: but when they had waited a good while, and saw no hurt come to him, they changed their opinion and said that he was a god.

7. Now in the parts adjacent to this place was the seat of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius, who took us into his house, and entertained us three days courteously.

8. And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and dysentery: to whom Paul went in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.

9. Upon this, others also in the island, who had diseases came to him and were cured:

10. who also honoured us with many honors, and furnished us, when we departed, with such things as were necessary.

11. And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, that had wintered in the island, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.

12. And being arrived at Syracuse, we staid there three days.

13. From whence coasting round we came to Rhegium, and after one day a south-wind rising, we came the second day to Puteoli:

14. where finding some brethren, we were desired to stay with them seven days: and so we went on to Rome.

15. And when the brethren heard of us, they came from thence to meet us, some as far as Appii-forum, and others to the Three-taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God and took courage.

16. And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was permitted to live by himself with the soldier that had him in custody.

17. And after three days Paul called together the chief of the Jews. And when they were come together, he said unto them, Brethren, though I have done nothing against the people of the Jews, or the customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:

18. who when they had examined me, would have set me at liberty, because there was no crime worthy of death found in me:

19. but the Jews opposing it, I was obliged to appeal to Cesar; though not as having any thing to accuse my nation of.

20. For this reason therefore I desired to see and to speak to you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.

21. And they said to him, We have neither received letters concerning thee from Judea, nor has any of the brethren, that is come hither, related or spoken any ill of thee.

22. But we would willingly hear from thee what thou thinkest: for as to this sect, we know that it is every where spoken against.

23. And having appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging; to whom he discoursed and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them of the things concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses, and from the prophets, from morning till evening.

24. And some regarded the things that were spoken, but others did not believe.

25. And so disagreeing one with another they separated, when Paul had said one word, to wit, that the holy Spirit spake rightly by Esaias the prophet to our fathers,

26. saying, Go to this people and say, Ye shall hear by the hearing of the ear, and not understand; and in seeing ye shall see, and not perceive: for the heart of this people is stupified,

27. and they hear heavily with their ears, and have closed their eyes; least they should see at all with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.

28. Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it.

29. And when he had said these things, the Jews departed, having much debate among themselves.

30. And Paul abode two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came to him:

31. preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom, none forbidding him.
