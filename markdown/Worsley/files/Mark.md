# Mark

## Mark 1

1. The beginning of the gospel of JESUS CHRIST the Son of GOD.

2. As it is written in the prophets, "Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee:"

3. and again, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight:" accordingly John came baptizing in the wilderness,

4. and preaching the baptism of repentance in order to the remission of sins;

5. and all the country of Judea, and those of Jerusalem, went out to him, and were all baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.

6. And John was clothed with camels hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and he lived upon locusts and wild honey: and he preached,

7. saying, There cometh after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop and unloose.

8. I indeed have baptized you with water, but He will baptize you with the holy Spirit.

9. And in those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in Jordan:

10. and as soon as He came up from the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him.

11. And there was a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

12. And immediately the Spirit taketh Him out into the wilderness:

13. and He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan, and among the wild beasts: and angels ministred unto Him.

14. Now after John was cast into prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,

15. and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent, and believe the gospel.

16. And as He was walking by the sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea,

17. (for they were fishermen,) and Jesus said unto them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men:

18. and immediately they left their nets and followed Him.

19. And going a little farther, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship, mending their nets, and immediately called them likewise:

20. and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the men he had hired, and went along with Him.

21. And they went into Capernaum: and going directly into the synagogue on the sabbath, He taught the people: and they were astonished at his doctrine;

22. for He taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.

23. And there was in their synagogue a man with an impure spirit,

24. and he cried out, saying, Let us alone, what have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee, who thou art, the holy one of God.

25. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him: and the impure spirit threw him into convulsions,

26. and roaring with a loud voice, came out of him.

27. And they were all amazed, so that they inquired of each other, saying, What is this, what new kind of doctrine is this? for He commands with authority even the impure spirits, and they obey Him.

28. And straitway his fame spread into all the country round about Galilee.

29. And as soon as they came out of the synagogue, they went into the house of Simon and Andrew, together with James and John.

30. And Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever: and they immediately told Him of her:

31. and He came to her, and taking her by the hand raised her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she waited upon them.

32. And in the evening, when the sun set, they brought to Him all that were ill, and demoniacs:

33. and the whole city was gathered together at the door;

34. and He healed many that were ill of various diseases, and cast out many devils, and suffered not the devils to say that they knew Him.

35. And in the morning, before it was light, He rose up and went out, and retired into a solitary place, and there prayed.

36. And Simon, and they that were with him, went in quest of Him:

37. and when they found Him, they said to Him, all the people are seeking for thee.

38. And He saith unto them, Let us go into the neighbouring towns, that I may preach there also; for this was the end of my coming.

39. And He went preaching in their synagogues, through all Galilee, and casting out devils.

40. And there came to Him a leper, beseeching Him, and kneeling down to Him, and saying unto Him, If thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me:

41. and Jesus, being moved with compassion, stretched out his hand and touched him, and saith unto Him, I will;

42. be thou healed: and as soon as He had spoken, immediately the leprosy left him, and he was healed.

43. And he gave him a strict charge, and immediately dismissed him,

44. and saith unto him, See thou tell no man: but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy purification what Moses has commanded, for a testimony to them.

45. But when he was gone he began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the report: so that Jesus could no more go openly into the city, but kept out in country places: and they came to Him from all parts. 

## Mark 2

1. And after some days He went again into Capernaum; and it being heard that He was in the house,

2. great numbers were immediately gathered together, so that there was no more room to contain them, not even about the door: and as he was preaching the word unto them,

3. there came some to Him, bringing a paralytic who was carried by four men:

4. and not being able to come near to Him for the croud, they uncovered the roof where He was, and when they had made an openning, they let down the couch on which the paralytic was laid.

5. And Jesus, seeing their faith, saith to him that had the palsy, Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.

6. But there were some of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,

7. Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God?

8. And Jesus, who knew immediately in his spirit that they were thus reasoning within themselves, said unto them, Why do ye dispute these things in your hearts?

9. Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Rise, take up thy couch, and walk?

10. But that ye may know, that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins,

11. I say unto thee (saith He to the paralytic,) Arise, and take up thy couch, and go thy way to thine own house.

12. And he instantly arose, and taking up his couch, went out before them all, so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, we never saw the like.

13. And He went out again towards the sea-side, and all the people resorted to Him, and He taught them.

14. And as He went along, He saw Levi the son of Alpheus, sitting at the receit of custom, and saith unto him, Follow me: and he rose up and followed Him.

15. And as He sat at table in his house, many publicans and sinners also sat down with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed Him.

16. And the scribes and pharisees, when they saw Him eating with publicans and sinners, said to his disciples, What is the meaning that He eateth with publicans and sinners?

17. Which Jesus hearing, saith unto them, They that are in health have no need of a physician, but they that are ill: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.

18. And as the disciples of John, and of the pharisees used to fast, they came to Him, saying, Why do the disciples of John and of the pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?

19. And Jesus said unto them, Can the bridemen fast, when the bridegroom is with them? while the bridegroom is with them, they cannot fast:

20. but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them; and then shall they fast.

21. No man seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment; otherwise, it's new patch teareth from the old, and the rent is made worse:

22. nor does any one put new wine into old vessels; otherwise the new wine bursteth the vessels, and the wine is spilt, and the vessels are destroyed: but new wine should be put into new vessels.

23. And as He was going thro' the corn-fields on the sabbath-day, his disciples began as they went along to pluck the ears of corn.

24. And the pharisees said to Him, See, why do they what is not lawful to be done on the sabbath-day?

25. And He said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, in his necessity, when he was hungry, himself and those that were with him?

26. how he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar, who was afterwards the high priest, and did eat the shew-bread, which it is not lawful for any to eat, but the priests, and gave also to them that were with him!

27. And He said moreover unto them, The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath:

28. and therefore the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath. 

## Mark 3

1. And He went another time into a synagogue, where there was a man that had a withered hand:

2. and they watched Him, whether He would heal him on the sabbath-day, that they might accuse Him.

3. And He said to the man, that had the withered hand, Rise up into the midst:

4. then saith He to them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? but they were silent.

5. And when He had looked round upon them with indignation, being grieved at the hardness of their hearts, He saith to the man, Stretch out thine hand: and he stretched it out, and his hand was made as sound as the other.

6. And the pharisees went out, and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against Him, how to destroy Him:

7. but Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea.

8. And a great multitude from Galilee followed Him, and from Judea, and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond Jordan; and those about Tyre and Sidon, a great number, hearing how great things He did, came unto Him.

9. Therefore He spake to his disciples, that there might be a small vessel attending Him, because of the multitude, least they should throng Him: for He had healed many,

10. so that whoever had any maladies, crouded upon Him to touch Him.

11. And impure spirits, when they saw Him, fell down before Him, and cried out, saying, Thou art the Son of God:

12. but He strictly charged them not to make Him known.

13. Then going up into a mountain, He calleth for such as He saw fit, and they came to Him:

14. and He appointed twelve to be with Him, and that He might send them forth to preach the gospel,

15. and to have power to heal diseases, and to cast out demons;

16. even Simon, whom He surnamed Peter,

17. and James the Son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, (and He surnamed them Boanerges, which is to say, Sons of thunder,) and Andrew,

18. and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alpheus, and Thaddeus,

19. and Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, even him who betrayed Him.

20. And they went into a house, and the multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat.

21. And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on Him; for they said He spends Himself too much.

22. And the scribes that came down from Jerusalem said, He is in league with Beelzebub, and casts out demons by the help of the prince of demons.

23. So He called them to Him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?

24. If a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand:

25. and if a family be divided against itself, that family cannot stand: and if Satan oppose himself and be divided,

26. he cannot stand, but his kingdom is at an end.

27. No one can enter into the house of a strong man, and plunder his goods; unless he first bind the strong man, and then he may pillage his house.

28. Verily I tell you, that all sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith they may blaspheme:

29. but whosoever blasphemeth against the holy Ghost never hath forgiveness, but is liable to eternal damnation:

30. for they said, He hath an impure spirit.

31. So his brethren and his mother came, and standing without sent to Him to call Him to them:

32. and there was a multitude sitting about Him, and they said to Him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren are without inquiring for thee.

33. And He answered them, and said, Who is my mother, or my brethren?

34. And looking round on those that sat about Him, He said, Behold my mother, and my brethren:

35. for whosoever doth the will of God, he is to me as my brother, my sister, and mother. 

## Mark 4

1. And He began to teach again by the sea-side, and there was gathered unto Him a great multitude; so that He went into a ship, and sat on board, and all the people were by the sea, upon the shore.

2. And He taught them many things by similitudes, and said to them in his instruction,

3. hearken, Behold a sower went out to sow:

4. and in sowing, some fell by the way-side, and the birds came and ate it up:

5. and some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth, and it sprang up immediately, because it had not depth of earth;

6. but when the sun rose, it was burnt up, and withered because it had no root:

7. and some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit:

8. and other fell on good ground, and yielded fruit springing up and increasing; and produced some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred-fold.

9. And He said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

10. And when He was apart from the multitude, those that were about Him with the twelve asked Him concerning the parable.

11. And he said unto them, To you it is granted to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but unto them that are without all things are delivered in parables:

12. that in seeing they may see and not perceive, and in hearing they may hear and not understand, least they should be converted, and their sins be forgiven them.

13. Then saith He unto them, Do ye not understand this parable? how then will ye understand all my other parables.

14. The sower is he that soweth the word. And these are they by the way-side:

15. where the word is sown; but when they have heard it, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.

16. And in like manner, they that are sown as on stony grounds are such, as when they hear the word,

17. immediately receive it with joy, but have no root in themselves, and so continue but for a short season: and then, when affliction cometh, or persecution on account of the word, they are as soon offended.

18. And those that are sown as among thorns, are these: such as hear the word indeed,

19. but the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and inordinate desires after other things entering in choke the word, and so it becometh unfruitful.

20. And these are they who are like seed sown on good ground: such as hear the word, and receive it; and bring forth fruit, some thirty-fold, and some sixty, and some an hundred.

21. And He said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or a bed, and not to be set on a candlestick?

22. for there is nothing hidden, which may not be revealed; nor was there any thing concealed, but in order to become manifest.

23. If any one hath ears to hear, let him hear.

24. And mind what ye hear: for with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you; and more shall be imparted to you that are observant:

25. for whosoever hath, to him more shall be given; and he that hath not, even what he hath, or seemeth to have, shall be taken from him.

26. And He said, The kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed into the ground,

27. and sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up, and increase; he knows not how.

28. For the earth produces fruit of itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear:

29. but when the fruit is ripe, he immediately puts in the sickle, because the harvest is come.

30. And He said, To what shall we compare the kingdom of God, or by what similitude shall we represent it?

31. It is like to a grain of mustard-seed, which when it is sown in the ground, is one of the lest of all the seeds on the earth:

32. but after it is sown, it grows up, and becomes greater than all herbs, and produces large branches, so that the birds of the air may lodge under it's shadow.

33. And in many such parables spake He the word to them, as they had ability to hear it: but spake not to them without a parable.

34. And He explained all to his disciples in private.

35. And the same day, in the evening, He saith to them, Let us go over to the other side.

36. So they dismissed the multitude, and took Him as He was in the ship. But there were other small vessels likewise with Him.

37. And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now almost full.

38. And He was in the stern asleep on a pillow: and they awake Him, and say unto Him, Master, art thou under no concern that we are perishing?

39. And He rose and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still; and the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.

40. And He said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how! have ye no faith?

41. And they were exceedingly afraid, and said to one another, Who is this? that even the wind and the sea obey Him? 

## Mark 5

1. And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.

2. And when He was come out of the ship, immediately there met Him from the tombs,

3. a man with an impure spirit, who kept among the tombs; and no one could bind him, not even with chains:

4. for he had often been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been pulled asunder by him, and the fetters broken; and no man could tame him:

5. and he was always night and day upon the hills and among the sepulchres bawling, and gashing himself with stones.

6. But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped Him,

7. and crying out with a loud voice said, Jesus thou Son of the most high God, what have I to do with thee? I adjure thee by God, that thou wouldst not torment me:

8. (for He said to him, Thou impure spirit, come out of the man.)

9. And He asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.

10. And he earnestly intreated Him, that He would not send them out of that country.

11. Now there was a great herd of swine feeding upon the mountains:

12. and all the demons intreated Him, saying, Send us to the swine, that we may enter into them.

13. And immediately Jesus permitted them: and the impure spirits went out of the man, and entered into the swine; and the herd (which were about two thousand,) ran violently down a precipice into the sea, and were suffocated.

14. And they that were feeding the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what was done:

15. and they come to Jesus, and see the demoniac, who had been possessed by the legion, sitting and clothed, and in his right mind; and they were afraid.

16. And when those that saw it told them what had happened to the demoniac,

17. and concerning the swine, they intreated Him to depart from their borders.

18. And as He went into the ship, the demoniac intreated Him that he might be with Him:

19. but Jesus did not permit him; but saith to him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee:

20. and he departed, and published in Decapolis, how great things Jesus had done for him, and they were all amazed.

21. And when Jesus passed over again in the ship to the other side, a great multitude was gathered unto Him, nigh unto the sea.

22. And behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, named Jairus; and as soon as he saw Him, he fell at his feet,

23. and earnestly intreated Him, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death, I beseech thee that thou wouldst come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed, and she will live.

24. So Jesus went with him, and a great multitude followed Him, and pressed about Him.

25. And a woman who had been in a flux twelve years,

26. and had suffered a great deal from many physicians, and spent all that she had, and received no benefit, but rather grew worse,

27. when she heard of Jesus, came behind Him in the croud, and touched his garment; for she said,

28. If I can but touch his clothes, I shall be cured.

29. And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt within herself that she was healed of the disorder.

30. And immediately Jesus, knowing in Himself that power was gone out of Him, turned about in the croud and said, Who touched my clothes?

31. And his disciples said unto Him, Thou seest the multitude crouding about thee, and dost thou ask, Who touched me?

32. and He looked round about to see who had done it.

33. But the woman being afraid and trembling, as knowing what had been done in her, came and prostrated herself to Him, and told Him all the truth:

34. and He said to her, Daughter, thy faith has saved thee; go in peace, and be healed of thy disorder.

35. While He was yet speaking, there came some from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying, Thy daughter is dead, why dost thou trouble the Master any more?

36. But Jesus hearing the word that was spoken, immediately saith to the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe:

37. and He suffered none to go along with Him, but Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.

38. And He cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth a tumult, people weeping and lamenting greatly:

39. and when He was come in, He saith unto them, Why do ye take on thus and weep? the child is not dead, but asleep.

40. And they laughed at Him: but when He had turned them all out, He taketh the father, and the mother of the child, and those three that were with Him, and goes in where the child was laid:

41. and taking hold of her hand, He saith unto her, Talitha, cumi, which is, being interpreted, Damsel, (I say unto thee) arise:

42. and immediately the damsel rose up and walked; for she was twelve years old; and they were struck with great astonishment.

43. And He strictly charged them, that no one should know it: and bid them give her something to eat. 

## Mark 6

1. And He went out from thence, and came into his own country, and his disciples attended Him:

2. and when the sabbath was come, He began to teach in the synagogue: and many that heard Him were astonished, and said, From whence hath He these things? and what is this wisdom which is given unto Him, that even such mighty things are done by his hands?

3. Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here among us? and they were prejudiced against Him.

4. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is nowhere less honoured, than in his own country, and among his relations, and his own family.

5. And He could do no miracle there, only laying his hands on a few sick people He healed them;

6. and He was amazed at their unbelief. But he went about all the villages round, teaching.

7. And He calleth unto Him the twelve, and sent them forth two and two, and gave them power over impure spirits;

8. and ordered them to take nothing for their journey, but a staff only; no bag, nor bread, nor money in their purse:

9. but to tie on their sandals, and not to put on two coats.

10. And He said unto them, wheresoever ye enter into a house, there stay till ye leave that place.

11. And whosoever will not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Sodom or Gomorrah in the day of judgement, than for that city.

12. And they went forth, and preached that men should repent.

13. And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.

14. And king Herod heard of Him, (for his name was spread abroad,) and he said, John the baptist is risen from the dead, and therefore miraculous powers appear in him.

15. Others said, it is Elias: and others said, it is a prophet, or like one of the prophets.

16. But when Herod heard of Him, he said, it is John whom I beheaded, he is risen from the dead.

17. For Herod had sent and seized John, and bound him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because he had married her:

18. For John had said to Herod, it is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.

19. Wherefore Herodias persecuted him, and would have taken away his life:

20. but could not; for Herod revered John, knowing him to be a just and holy man, and protected him: and when he heard him he did many things according to John's instructions, and heard him willingly.

21. But a convenient day happening, when Herod on his birth-night gave a supper to his lords, and chief officers, and persons of distinction in Galilee; and the daughter of Herodias coming in,

22. and dancing, and having pleased Herod and his guests, the king said to the young princess, Ask of me whatever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.

23. And he gave her his oath too, whatever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, even to the half of my kingdom.

24. And she withdrew and consulted her mother, what to ask: and she said, The head of John the baptist.

25. And immediately she came in again with eagerness to the king, and said, I desire that thou wouldst give me directly the head of John the baptist in a dish.

26. And the king was exceedingly grieved, but on account of his oath, and those who were at table with him, he would not refuse her: but immediately sent one of his guard,

27. and ordered his head to be brought:

28. and he went and beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head in a dish, and gave it to the damsel, and the damsel carried it to her mother.

29. And his disciples hearing of it, came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a sepulchre.

30. And the apostles came together to Jesus, and told Him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.

31. And He said to them, Come ye yourselves apart into a retired place, and rest a little: for there were many coming and going, and they had not time even to eat.

32. And they went away privately in a ship into a desert place.

33. And the people saw them departing, and many took notice of them, and ran thither on foot from all the cities, and got before them, and came together unto Him.

34. And when Jesus came out of the ship, He saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion towards them; because they were as sheep without a shepherd: and He began to teach them many things.

35. And when it was now late in the day, his disciples came to Him, and said, this is a desert place, and it is now late:

36. dismiss them, that they may go into the country-places and villages round about, and buy themselves bread; for they have nothing to eat.

37. But He answered them, Do ye give them something to eat. And they say to Him, shall we go and buy two hundred penny-worth of bread, and give them to eat?

38. But He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they had examined, they said, Five, and two fishes.

39. And He ordered them to cause all the people to sit down by companies upon the grass:

40. and they sat down in an oblong square, an hundred by fifty.

41. And when He had taken the five loaves, and the two fishes, He looked up to heaven, and gave thanks; then He brake the loaves and gave them to his disciples, to set before them; the two fishes likewise He divided among them all.

42. And they did all eat and were fully satisfied.

43. And they took up of the fragments of the bread, and of the fishes, twelve baskets full.

44. And they that had eaten were about five thousand men.

45. And immediately He obliged his disciples to get into the ship, and to go before Him to the other side to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the people:

46. and when He had sent them away, He retired into a mountain to pray.

47. And when the evening was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and He alone upon the land:

48. and He saw them labouring in rowing; (for the wind was contrary:) and about the fourth watch of the night He cometh to them walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.

49. But they seeing Him walking upon the water, thought it was an apparition, and cried out: for they all saw Him and were frighted.

50. And He immediately spake to them, and saith, Be of good courage, it is I, be not afraid.

51. And He went up into the ship to them, and the wind ceased, and they were exceedingly amazed in themselves, and wondered: not considering the miracle of the loaves,

52. for their heart was stupified.

53. And they passed over and came to the country of Gennesaret, and put to shore:

54. and when they came out of the ship, immediately the people knew Him, and ran through all the country,

55. and carried about in beds those that were sick, where they heard He was.

56. And wherever He came into their towns, or cities, or villages, they laid the sick in the streets, and intreated Him that they might but touch the border of his garment, and as many as touched it were healed. 

## Mark 7

1. And there were gathered unto Him the pharisees, and some of the scribes, from Jerusalem;

2. and when they saw some of his disciples eating with impure (that is, unwashed) hands, they found fault:

3. for the pharisees, and indeed all the Jews, do not eat till they have washed their hands thoroughly, observing the tradition of the ancients.

4. And when they come from the market, they do not eat till they have washed. And there are many other things, which they have received to observe, as the washing of cups, and pots, and brass-vessels, and seats.

5. Then the pharisees and the scribes ask Him, Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the ancients, but eat without washing their hands?

6. But He answered them, Well did Esaias prophesy concerning you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me:

7. and in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the injunctions of men.

8. For laying aside the commandment of God, ye retain the tradition of men, as the washings of pots and cups, and many other such like things.

9. And ye expressly annul the commandment of God, that ye may retain your own tradition;

10. for Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, He that revileth father or mother, let him be put to death:

11. but ye say, If a man tell his father or mother, That which thou mightest be profited by from me is Corban, (that is, a gift to the temple) it sufficeth:

12. and so ye allow him to do nothing more for his father or his mother:

13. making void the word of God by your tradition,. And many such like things ye do.

14. And calling all the people to Him, He said unto them,

15. Hear me all of you, and understand, There is nothing without a man, which entring into him can defile him: but the things proceeding from him are those which defile a man.

16. If any one hath ears to hear, let him hear.

17. And when He was come into the house, away from the multitude, his disciples asked Him concerning the meaning of the parable.

18. And He saith unto them, Are ye so void of understanding also? Do ye not know, that whatsoever from without entreth into a man cannot defile him?

19. because it entreth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all his food.

20. But said He, What cometh out of a man, that defileth the man;

21. for out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts,

22. adulteries, fornications, murthers, thefts, avarice, malice, deceit, lasciviousness, envy, slander, pride, folly;

23. all these evils come from within and defile the man.

24. And He arose and went from thence to the borders of Tyre and Sidon; and going into a house He would have had no body know it, but He could not be concealed: for a woman,

25. whose child was possessed by an evil spirit, having heard of Him, came and fell at his feet,

26. (now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation,) and she besought Him to cast out the demon from her daughter.

27. But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be satisfied: for it is not fit to take the children's bread, and throw it to the dogs.

28. And she answered and said unto Him, True, Lord, yet the dogs under the table, eat of the children's crumbs.

29. And He said unto her, For this saying, go thy way, the demon is gone out of thy daughter.

30. And she went away to her house, and found the demon gone out, and her daughter laid on the bed.

31. And departing again out of the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, He came to the sea of Galilee thro' the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.

32. And they brought to Him a deaf man, who had likewise an impediment in his speech, and pray Him to put his hand upon him.

33. And He took him aside out of the croud, and He spit and put his fingers into his ears, and touched his tongue:

34. and looking up to heaven He sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, be opened:

35. and immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake distinctly.

36. And He charged them to tell no one, but the more He charged them, the more they published it:

37. and were exceedingly astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak. 

## Mark 8

1. In those days, there being again a very great multitude, and they having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to Him,

2. and saith unto them, I have compassion on the multitude, for they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:

3. and if I send them away fasting to their own home, they will faint by the way; for some of them are come from far.

4. And his disciples answered Him, From whence can one satisfy these people with bread here in a desert?

5. And He asked them, How many loaves have ye? and they said, Seven.

6. And He ordered the people to sit down upon the ground: and taking the seven loaves, He gave thanks and brake them, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the multitude.

7. And they had a few small fishes: and He blessed them, and bid them set them also before the people.

8. And they did eat and were satisfied: and they took up what were left, to wit of fragments seven baskets:

9. and they that had eaten were about four thousand. And then He dismissed them.

10. And going directly on board a ship with his disciples, He came into the parts of Dalmanutha:

11. and the pharirisees came forth, and began to dispute with Him, desiring of Him a sign from heaven, tempting Him.

12. And He sighing deeply in his spirit, saith, Why doth this generation require a sign? Verily I tell you, There shall no sign be given to this generation.

13. So He left them, and went on board the ship again, and departed to the other side.

14. And his disciples had forgot to take bread, neither had they any more than one loaf with them in the ship.

15. And therefore as He was giving them a charge, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod,

16. they argued one with another, saying, It is because we have no bread.

17. And Jesus knowing it saith unto them, What are ye reasoning about? because ye have no bread? Do ye not yet discern nor understand? have ye your heart still hardened?

18. Have ye eyes, and do not see? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?

19. When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did ye take up? They answer, Twelve.

20. And when I divided the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? and they said, Seven.

21. And He said unto them, How is it then that ye do not understand?

22. Then He cometh to Bethsaida, where they brought to Him a blind man, and begged of Him that He would touch him.

23. And He took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and having spit on his eyes, He laid his hands upon him, and asked him, If he saw any thing.

24. And he looked up, and said, I see men (as it were trees) walking.

25. Then He put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored to sight, and saw them all plainly.

26. And He sent him away to his house, and said, Neither go into the town, nor tell any one in the town.

27. Then Jesus and his disciples went out into the towns of Cesarea Philippi: and by the way He asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I am?

28. And they answered, Some say, John the baptist; and others, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.

29. And He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answered and saith, Thou art the Christ.

30. And He charged them, that they should say this to no one concerning Him:

31. and began to tell them, that the Son of man must suffer much; and be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and scribes; and be put to death: and after three days rise again.

32. And this He spake plainly and openly. Upon which Peter began to rebuke Him.

33. But He turned about and looking on his disciples reproved Peter, saying, Get thee behind me Satan; for thou savourest not the things of God, but the things that be of men.

34. And calling the people and his disciples to Him, He said unto them, Whosoever is willing to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me:

35. for he that would save his life, shall lose it; but he that would lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, shall save it.

36. For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?

37. or what shall a man give as a ransom for his soul?

38. for whosoever shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this degenerate and sinful age, of him will the Son of man be also ashamed, when He cometh in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels. 

## Mark 9

1. And He said unto them, Verily I tell you, that there are some of those who stand here, that shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.

2. And after six days Jesus taketh with Him Peter, and James, and John, and bringeth them up by themselves to a high mountain apart; and was transfigured before them:

3. and his raiment shone, being exceeding white as snow, so as no fuller on earth can whiten.

4. And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.

5. Then said Peter to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: let us make three tabernacles; one for Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias:

6. for he knew not what to say, for they were sore afraid.

7. And there was a cloud overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him.

8. And immediately looking round about, they saw no more of any one, but Jesus alone with them.

9. And as they came down from the mountain, He charged them to tell no one what they had seen, till after the Son of man were risen from the dead.

10. And they laid hold on that expression, querying among themselves, what means the rising from the dead?

11. Then they asked Him, saying, Why do the scribes say, that Elias must come first?

12. And He answered and told them, Elias doth indeed come first, and settle all things: He told them likewise how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things and be used contemptuously.

13. But I tell you, that Elias is come, and they have done to him whatever they would, as it is written of him.

14. And when He came to the other disciples, He saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes disputing with them.

15. And immediately all the people, when they saw Him, were astonished; and running to Him, saluted Him.

16. And he asked the scribes, What are ye disputing about?

17. And one of the multitude answered, and said, Master I have brought unto thee my son, who is possessed by a dumb spirit:

18. and wherever it seizeth him, it convulseth him; and he fometh, and gnasheth his teeth, and thus he pineth away: and I desired thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not.

19. And He answered and said, O unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him to me.

20. And they brought him to Him: and as soon as he saw Him, immediately the spirit threw him into convulsions: and he fell upon the ground, and rolled about foming.

21. And He asked his father, How long is it since this befel him? And he said, From a child.

22. And it has often thrown him both into the fire and into the waters to destroy him. But if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us and help us.

23. And Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.

24. And the father of the child immediately cried out and said with tears, Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief.

25. when Jesus saw the people flock together, He rebuked the impure spirit, and said to him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, Come out of him, and enter no more into him.

26. And when he had rored and vehemently convulsed him, he came out of him: and the child was as one dead, so that many said, that he was dead.

27. But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.

28. And when He was come into the house, his disciples asked Him in private, Why could not we cast him out?

29. And He said unto them, This kind cannot be cast out, but by prayer and fasting.

30. And they departed from thence and passed through Galilee, and He was not willing that any should know it;

31. for He was instructing his disciples, and told them, the Son of man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will put Him to death; and on the third day, after his being put to death, He will rise again.

32. But they knew not his meaning, and were afraid to ask Him.

33. And he came to Capernaum; and when He was in the house, He asked them, What were ye disputing about among yourselves by the way?

34. But they held their peace; for they had been disputing with each other by the way who should be the greatest.

35. So He sat down and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any one would be first, let him be last of all, and servant of all.

36. And He took a child and set him in the midst of them, and taking him in his arms He said unto them,

37. Whoever shall receive one of these little children in my name, receiveth me; and whosoever receiveth me, receiveth not me only, but Him that sent me.

38. But John answered Him and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name, who doth not follow us; and we forbade him, because he followeth not us.

39. But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no one, that worketh a miracle in my name, and can presently speak evil of me:

40. for he that is not against us, is for us.

41. For whosoever shall give you but a cup of water to drink, for my sake; because ye are Christ's, I assure you, he shall not lose his reward.

42. And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones, that believe in me, to offend, it were better for him, if a milstone were laid upon his neck, and he were cast into the sea.

43. And if thy hand cause thee to offend, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands, to go into hell, into the fire that will never be extinguished;

44. where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

45. And if thy foot cause thee to offend, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life lame, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the inextinguishable fire;

46. where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

47. And if thine eye cause thee to offend, cast it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell-fire;

48. where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

49. For every one shall be as it were salted by fire, and every sacrifice shall be seasoned as with salt.

50. Salt is useful, but if the salt become insipid, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt therefore in yourselves, and as a proof of it be at peace one with another. 

## Mark 10

1. And He arose from thence and came into the coasts of Judea, through the country beyond Jordan: and the people resorted to Him again; and, as He was wont, He taught them again.

2. And the pharisees came to Him and asked Him, "if it were lawful for a man to put away his wife," tempting Him.

3. And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?

4. And they said, Moses permitted a man to write a bill of divorce, and to put her away.

5. And Jesus replied, He wrote this precept on account of your cruel tempers:

6. but from the beginning of the world, God created them male and female.

7. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother,

8. and be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh: so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.

9. Therefore let not man separate what God hath joined together.

10. And when they were in the house his disciples asked Him again about it:

11. and He told them, Whoever putteth away his wife and marrieth another, committeth adultery against her.

12. And if a woman be divorced from her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.

13. And they brought to Him little children that He might touch them: and the disciples rebuked those that brought them.

14. Which Jesus observing, was much displeased, and said to them, Let the children come to me; and hinder them not; for of such is the kingdom of God.

15. Verily I tell you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, shall by no means enter into it.

16. And He took them in his arms, and put his hands upon them, and blessed them.

17. And as he went out into the way, there came one running and kneeling to Him, and asked Him, Good master, what shall I do, that I may inherit eternal life?

18. And Jesus said unto him, Why dost thou call me good? there is none good, but one, that is God.

19. Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honour thy father and thy mother.

20. And he answered and said unto Him, Master, all these have I kept from my youth.

21. Then Jesus looked upon him with affection, and said to him, One thing thou wantest; go, sell all that thou hast, and give it to the poor; and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross and follow me.

22. But he was sad at that saying, and went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.

23. And Jesus looking round about saith to his disciples, How difficultly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!

24. And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus repeating it, saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them, that trust in riches, to enter into the kingdom of God!

25. It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

26. And they were exceedingly amazed, saying one to another, Who then can be saved?

27. But Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God; for with God all things are possible.

28. Then Peter said to Him, Behold we have left all, and followed thee.

29. And Jesus answered and said, Verily I tell you, there is no one that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children,

30. or lands for my sake and the gospel's, but he shall receive an hundred-fold: now in this time indeed, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands with persecutions; but in the world to come life everlasting.

31. But many that are first shall be last, and the last first.

32. And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed at it, and afraid to follow Him. And again taking the twelve aside, He began to tell them what things should befal Him,

33. saying, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests, and the scribes, and they will condemn Him to death, and deliver Him to the Gentiles;

34. and they will insult Him, and scourge Him, and spit upon Him, and put Him to death: but on the third day He shall rise again.

35. Then come to Him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying, Master, we desire that thou wouldest do for us what we shall request:

36. and He said to them, What do ye desire me to do for you?

37. they said unto Him, Grant that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left, in thy glory.

38. But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask. Can ye drink of the cup, that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?

39. And they said, We can. And Jesus said unto them, The cup indeed which I drink, ye shall drink of; and with the baptism, that I am baptized with, shall ye be baptized:

40. but to sit on my right hand and on my left, is not mine to give, but for whom it is prepared.

41. And when the other ten heard it, they were provoked at James and John.

42. But Jesus called them to Him, and said unto them, Ye know that those who rule among the Gentiles, lord it over them, and their grandees exercise authority upon them.

43. But it shall not be so among you: but whoever would be great among you shall be your minister;

44. and whoever of you would be first shall be servant of all.

45. For the Son of man came not to be ministred unto, but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many.

46. And they came to Jericho: and as He was going out of Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, blind Bartimeus, the son of Timeus, sat by the way-side begging.

47. And hearing that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.

48. And many rebuked him, that he might hold his peace: but he cried out so much the more, Thou son of David, have pity on me.

49. And Jesus stopt, and ordered him to be called: so they called the blind man, and said to him, Be of good courage, rise up, He calleth thee.

50. And he threw off his outer garment, and arose, and came to Jesus.

51. And Jesus said to him, What dost thou desire that I should do for thee? And the blind man said to Him, Lord, that I may recover my sight.

52. And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way, thy faith has cured thee. And he immediately recovered his sight, and followed Jesus in the way. 

## Mark 11

1. And when they came near to Jerusalem, even to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, He sendeth two of his disciples,

2. and saith to them, Go into the village over against you, and as soon as ye enter into it, ye will find a colt tied, on which no man hath yet sat; loose him, and bring him to me.

3. And if any one say to you, Why do ye so? tell him, that the Lord hath need of it, and he will immediately send it hither.

4. And they went and found the colt tied at a door abroad, where two ways met, and they untied it.

5. And some of the people that stood there, said to them, What do ye mean by untying the colt?

6. And they answered them as Jesus had ordered, and they permitted them.

7. So they brought the colt to Jesus, and laid their garments on it, and He sat upon it.

8. And many spread their clothes in the way; and others cut off branches from the trees, and strewed them in the way.

9. And they that went before, and they that followed, cried out, saying, Hosanna, blessed be He that cometh in the name of the Lord:

10. blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that is coming in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.

11. And Jesus went into Jerusalem, and into the temple; and when He had looked round upon every thing, it being now late in the day, He went out to Bethany with the twelve.

12. And on the morrow, as they came from Bethany, He was hungry:

13. and seeing a fig-tree at a distance, with leaves, He went to see if He might find any thing upon it; and when He came to it, He found nothing but leaves; (for the time of gathering figs was not yet come:) And Jesus spake and said unto it,

14. Let no one ever eat fruit of thee hereafter. And his disciples heard it.

15. Then they came to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to turn out those that sold and bought in the court of the temple, and threw down the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold doves:

16. and suffered not any one to carry a burthen through the courts of the temple.

17. And He taught them, saying, Is it not written, my house shall be called an house of prayer for all nations? But ye have made it a den of thieves.

18. And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how to destroy Him; for they feared Him, because all the people were struck with his doctrine.

19. And when it was evening, He went out of the city.

20. And in the morning, as they were passing by it, they saw the fig-tree withered from the roots.

21. And Peter remembring the tree, saith unto Him, Master, behold, the fig-tree which thou cursedst, is withered.

22. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God: for verily I tell you,

23. that whosoever shall say to this mountain, "Be thou removed and cast into the sea," and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he saith shall be done, he shall have whatsoever he saith.

24. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye ask in prayer, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.

25. But when ye pray, forgive, if ye have any thing against any one, that your heavenly Father may also forgive you your trespasses:

26. but if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive you your trespasses.

27. And they come again to Jerusalem, and as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests, and scribes, and elders come to Him,

28. and ask Him, By what authority dost thou these things, and who gave thee this authority, to do thus?

29. But Jesus said to them, I also will ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.

30. The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? answer me.

31. And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, from heaven; He will say, why then did ye not believe him?

32. but if we should say, from men --- they feared the people: (for they they all thought that John was a prophet indeed:)

33. and they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus replied and said unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things. 

## Mark 12

1. And He began to speak unto them in parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and made a fence about it, and digged a place for the wine-fat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and travelled abroad.

2. And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that he might receive from them of the fruit of the vineyard:

3. and they took him and beat him, and sent him away empty.

4. And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they threw stones, and wounded him on the head, and sent him away shamefully used.

5. And again, he sent another; and him they killed: and many others, beating some, and killing others.

6. Having yet therefore one Son, his beloved, he sent him also at last unto them, saying, they will reverence my Son.

7. But the husbandmen said to one another, this is the heir, Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.

8. And they took him, and killed Him too, casting him out of the vineyard.

9. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy those husbandmen, and will let the vineyard to others.

10. And have ye not read this scripture, "The stone, which the builders refused, is become the head of the corner:

11. this was from the Lord, and it is marvellous in our eyes."

12. And they sought to lay hands on Him, but they were afraid of the people; (for they knew that He spake the parable against them) and they left Him, and went away.

13. And they send to Him some of the pharisees, and of the Herodians to insnare Him in his discourse:

14. and these, when they came, said to Him, Master, we know that thou art a man of truth, and carest for no man; for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to pay tribute to Cesar, or not? should we give, or should we not give?

15. But He knew their hypocrisy, and said to them, Why do ye tempt me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.

16. So they brought one: and He saith to them, Whose is this image and inscription? And they said Cesar's.

17. And Jesus answered and said unto them, Render then unto Cesar the things that are Cesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at Him.

18. Then come the sadducees to Him, who say there is no resurrection;

19. and they asked Him, saying, Master, Moses, in his writings tells us, if any one's brother die, and leave a wife, and leave no children, that his brother shall take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.

20. Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife and died and left no seed;

21. and the second took her, and died, and he left no seed neither; and the third likewise.

22. And all the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all died the woman also.

23. In the resurrection therefore, when they rise again, whose wife shall be of them; for all the seven had her to wife?

24. And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, nor the power of God?

25. For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels in heaven.

26. But as to the dead, that they are raised, have ye not read in the book of Moses, how God spake to him in the bush, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?

27. He is not the God of the dead, but of the living: therefore ye do greatly mistake.

28. And one of the scribes, who heard them disputing, seeing that He answered them well, came to Him and asked Him, Which is the chief commandment of all?

29. And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is the one Lord,

30. and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength:" this is the first or chief commandment,

31. and the second is like it, even this, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself:" there is no other commandment greater than these.

32. And the scribe said unto Him, Truly, Master, thou hast spoke exceeding well; for there is one God, and there is no other beside Him.

33. And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole-burnt-offerings and sacrifices.

34. And Jesus seeing that he answered discreetly, said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no one dared any more to put questions to Him.

35. And Jesus spake and said, as He was teaching in the temple, How do the scribes say, that the Christ is the son of David?

36. for David himself said by the holy Spirit, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstool.

37. So that David himself calleth Him Lord: how then is He his son? And many of the people heard Him with pleasure.

38. And He said unto them as He was teaching them, Beware of the scribes, who love to walk in long robes, and salutations in public-places,

39. and the chief seats in the synagogues, and uppermost places at feasts;

40. who devour widows houses, and for a shew of religion make long prayers: these shall receive the heavier judgement.

41. And as Jesus was sitting over against the treasury, He saw how the people threw money into the treasury, and many of the rich put in much;

42. and there came a poor widow and put in two mites, that is, a farthing.

43. And He called his disciples to Him, and saith unto them, Verily I tell you, that this poor widow has given more than all those who have cast into the treasury.

44. For they all have contributed out of their abundance: but she out of her penury hath given all that she had, even her whole living. 

## Mark 13

1. And as He was going out of the temple, one of his disciples saith to Him, Master, behold what fine stones are here, and what stately buildings!

2. And Jesus answering said unto him, Thou seest these grand buildings: but there shall not be left one stone upon another, which shall not be thrown down.

3. And as He was sitting on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him privately,

4. saying, Tell us when these things shall be, and what shall be the sign when all these things are to be accomplished.

5. But Jesus answered them and said, Beware least any one deceive you:

6. for many shall come in my name saying, I am the Christ, and shall deceive many.

7. And when ye hear of wars, and rumors of wars, be not troubled; for such things must happen; but the end will not be yet.

8. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and famines and troubles: these will be the beginnings of sorrows.

9. But look to yourselves; for they will deliver you up to councils, and synagogues: and ye shall be scourged, and set before governors and kings on my account, for a testimony against them.

10. And the gospel must first be published to all nations.

11. But when they shall lead you to deliver you up, be not anxiously careful beforehand what ye shall speak, neither premeditate: but whatever shall be suggested to you at that very time, this speak: for it is not you that speak, but the holy Spirit.

12. One brother shall betray another to death, and the father the son: and children shall appear against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.

13. And ye shall be hated by all men for my sake: but he that endures to the end shall be saved.

14. Now when ye shall see the desolating abomination, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, set up where it ought not to be, (let him that readeth, attend) then let those in Judea flee to the mountains:

15. and let not him that is at the top of the house come down into the house, nor go in to fetch any thing out of his house:

16. nor let him that is in the field return back for his clothes.

17. But wo to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days.

18. But pray that your flight may not be in the winter;

19. for in those days shall be such affliction as never was from the beginning of the world, unto this day, nor ever shall be.

20. And if the Lord did not shorten those days, none could escape: but for the sake of the elect, whom He hath chosen, He hath shortened those days.

21. And then if any shall say to you, Behold, here is the Christ, or, Behold, He is there, believe it not:

22. for there shall rise up false Christs, and false prophets, who shall work signs and wonders, to seduce, if possible, even the elect.

23. But do ye beware: behold, I have told you all before.

24. But in those days, after that affliction, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give it's light; and the stars of heaven shall fall,

25. and the powers in the heavens shall be shaken;

26. and then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds, with great power and glory.

27. And He will then send forth his messengers, and will gather his elect together from the four winds, from the end of the earth to the end of heaven.

28. Now learn a parable from the fig-tree: when it's branch is tender and bringeth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh;

29. so ye also, when ye see these things come to pass, know that He is near, even at the doors.

30. Verily I tell you, that this generation shall not pass away until all these things be fulfilled.

31. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words cannot pass away.

32. But of THAT day and hour knoweth no one, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only.

33. Take heed therefore, watch and pray; for ye know not when the time is:

34. as a man travelling abroad, who left his house, and gave charge to his servants, to each his work, and bid the porter be watchful.

35. Watch ye therefore; for ye know not when the master of the house cometh: (in the evening, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning:)

36. least coming on a sudden he should find you sleeping.

37. And what I say to you, I say to all, Watch. 

## Mark 14

1. Now the feast of the passover and unleavened bread was within two days: and the chief priests and the scribes were contriving how they might seize Him by treachery and put Him to death.

2. But they said, Not on the feast-day, least there be a tumult of the people.

3. And when He was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as He was at table, there came a woman with an alabaster-box of ointment of spikenard, very valuable; and she brake the box and poured it on his head.

4. And there were some provoked at it and said, Why was this waste made of the ointment?

5. For it might have been sold for above three hundred pence, and given to the poor. And they inveighed against her.

6. But Jesus said, Let her alone, why do ye give her uneasiness?

7. She has done a kind office to me. For ye have the poor always with you, and may do them good, whenever ye will; but me ye have not always.

8. She has done what she could: she has embalmed my body beforehand against the burial.

9. Verily I tell you, wheresoever this gospel is preached, through all the world, what she hath done shall also be told for a memorial of her.

10. And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, in order to betray Him unto them.

11. And they were glad, when they heard it, and engaged to give him money. And he sought to betray Him at a proper season.

12. And on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the paschal lamb, his disciples said to Him, Where wouldst thou have us go and make preparation for thee to eat of the paschal lamb?

13. And He sendeth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go into the city, and there will meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water:

14. follow him, and where he goes in, say to the man of the house, The master inquireth, Where is the room, in which I may eat the passover with my disciples?

15. And he will shew you a large upper room ready prepared, there make preparation for us.

16. And his disciples went out, and came into the city, and found every thing as He told them; and so prepared the passover.

17. And in the evening He cometh with the rest of the twelve.

18. And when they were sat down and eating together, Jesus said, Verily I tell you, that one of you will betray me, who is now eating with me.

19. And they were grieved, and said to Him one by one, Is it I?

20. Is it I? And He said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that is now dipping with me in the dish.

21. The Son of man is going indeed as it is written concerning Him; but wo to that man by whom He is betrayed; it had been good for him, if that man had never been born.

22. And as they were at table, Jesus took bread, and when He had blessed it He brake it, and gave it to them, and said, Take, eat, This is my body:

23. and He took the cup, and when He had given thanks, He gave it to them: and they all drank of it.

24. And He said unto them, This is an emblem of my blood the seal of the new covenant, which is to be shed for many:

25. and I assure you, that I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine, till the day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God.

26. And when they had sung an hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.

27. And Jesus saith unto them, Ye will all of you be made to offend on my account this night; for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered:

28. but after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.

29. But Peter said to Him, though all should be made to offend, yet will not I.

30. And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I tell thee, that to day, even in this very night, before the cock crow twice thou wilt deny me thrice.

31. But he said with the more vehemence, Though I should die with thee, I will never disown thee. And so likewise said they all.

32. And they came to a place called Gethsemane, and He saith to his disciples, Sit here whilst I go and pray.

33. And He taketh Peter and James and John with Him, and He began to be overwhelmed with terror and anguish.

34. And He saith unto them, My Soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death, stay here and watch.

35. And going a little farther, He prostrated Himself, and prayed, if it were possible, that this hour might pass from Him.

36. And He said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to Thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless, not what I will, but what thou wilt.

37. And He cometh and findeth them asleep, and saith to Peter, Simon, art thou sleeping? couldst thou not watch one hour?

38. Watch, and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the body is weak.

39. And He went away again, and prayed, after the same manner.

40. And when He returned, He found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy; and they knew not what to say to Him.

41. And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Are ye sleeping still and taking your rest? It is enough, the hour is come: behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

42. Rise, let us go; see the traitor is at hand.

43. And immediately while He was yet speaking cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests, and scribes, and elders:

44. (Now the traitor had given them a sign, saying, The man, whom I shall kiss, is He; lay hold of Him and lead Him away safely:)

45. and as soon as he came, he went directly up to Him and said, Master, Master; and kissed Him.

46. And they laid their hands on Him, and apprehended Him.

47. And one of those that were present, drawing a sword, struck at the high priest's servant, and took off his ear.

48. And Jesus said unto them, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and clubs to take me?

49. I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye did not seize me: but this is done that the scriptures may be fulfilled.

50. And the disciples all forsook Him and fled: but there followed Him a certain youth,

51. who had only a linen cloth wrapt about him, and the young men laid hold on him;

52. and he let go the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.

53. And they led Jesus away to the high priest, with whom were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.

54. And Peter followed Him at a distance, even into the palace of the high priest: and sat down among the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.

55. Now the chief priests and all the council sought for evidence against Jesus, to put Him to death, and found none:

56. for many bare false witness against Him, and the evidences did not agree.

57. At last there rose up some and bare false witness against Him,

58. saying, We heard Him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands:

59. but neither was their evidence consistent.

60. Then the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus saying, Answerest thou nothing? what do these men witness against thee?

61. but he held his peace, and made him no answer. So the high priest asked Him again, and saith to Him, Art thou the Messiah the Son of the blessed God?

62. And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.

63. Then the high priest rent his clothes and said, What farther need have we of witnesses?

64. ye have heard the blasphemy; what think ye? and they all condemned Him as worthy of death.

65. And they spit upon Him, and blind-folded Him, and then buffeted Him and said to Him, prophesy who it was: and the officers struck him with their rods.

66. And Peter being in the hall below, there came one of the maid-servants of the high priest;

67. and when she saw Peter as he was warming himself, she looked earnestly upon him and said, Thou also wast with Jesus the Nazarene:

68. but he denied it, saying, I do not know Him, nor do I understand what thou meanest. And he went out into the porch, and the cock crew.

69. And the maid seeing him again said to them that stood by, This is one of them: and he denied it again.

70. And a little after, they that stood by, said to Peter again, Thou art certainly one of them: for thou art a Galilean, and thy speech is like theirs.

71. But he began to curse and swear saying, I do not know this man of whom ye speak: And the cock crowed a second time.

72. Then Peter called to mind the word which Jesus had said to him, Before the cock crow twice thou wilt deny me thrice. And he covered his face and wept. 

## Mark 15

1. And as soon as ever it was light the chief priests holding a consultation with the elders and scribes, they and the whole sanhedrim, bound Jesus, and carried Him away, and delivered Him to Pilate.

2. And Pilate asked Him, Art thou the king of the Jews? and He answered It is as thou sayst.

3. And the chief priests accused Him of many things: but he answered nothing.

4. So Pilate asked Him again, saying, Dost thou answer nothing? See how many things they witness against thee:

5. but Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate was amazed.

6. Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired:

7. and there was one Barabbas under confinement with some of his accomplices in sedition, who had committed murder in the insurrection.

8. And the people clamoured and desired him to do as he always used to do for them.

9. But Pilate answered them, saying, Would ye have me release to you the king of the Jews?

10. (for he knew that the chief priests had delivered Him up to him out of envy:)

11. but the chief priests incited the people to desire that he would rather release Barabbas to them.

12. And Pilate answered, and said to them again, What then would you have me do with Him, whom ye call king of the Jews?

13. And they cried out again, Crucify Him.

14. But Pilate said unto them, Why, what ill has He done? And they cried out the more vehemently, Crucify Him.

15. So Pilate being willing to ingratiate with the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and having scourged Jesus, delivered Him up to be crucified.

16. And the soldiers led Him away into the hall, which is called the Pretorium; and gathered their whole company together:

17. and they clad Him in purple, and platted a crown of thorns and put it on his head,

18. and saluted Him, saying, Hail king of the Jews;

19. and struck Him on the head with a reed, and spit upon Him, and bowed their knees, and did Him homage.

20. And when they had thus abused Him, they took off the purple from Him, and put his own clothes on Him, and brought Him out to crucify Him.

21. And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus, as he was passing by, coming out of the country, to carry his cross:

22. and they brought Him to a place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, the place of a scull.

23. And they offered Him wine mingled with myrrh to drink, but He would not take it.

24. And when they had fastened Him to the cross, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what each of them should take.

25. And it was the third hour, when they fixed Him on the cross:

26. and the title of his charge was written over Him, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

27. And they crucified two thieves with Him, one on his right hand and one on his left:

28. so that the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, "And He was numbered with the transgressors."

29. And they that passed by reviled Him, shaking their heads and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest, the temple,

30. and buildest it in three days, save thyself and come down from the cross.

31. And the chief priests likewise scoffing at Him among themselves, with the scribes, said, He saved others, Himself He cannot save: let Christ,

32. the king of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe in Him. And even they that were crucified with Him, reviled Him.

33. Now at the sixth hour there was darkness over the whole land, until the ninth hour.

34. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani," which is being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

35. And some of them that stood by hearing it, said, Behold He calleth upon Elias.

36. And there ran one, and filled a spunge with vinegar, and putting it on a reed offered it Him to drink, saying, Let Him alone, let us see whether Elias will come to take Him down.

37. But Jesus cried with a loud voice and expired.

38. And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.

39. And when the centurion, that stood over against Him, saw that He expired with such a cry, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.

40. There were also women at a distance looking on: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;

41. who also when He was in Galilee, followed Him and waited on Him: and several others who came up to Jerusalem with Him.

42. And the evening being now come, (because it was the preparation,

43. or the day before the sabbath,) Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable counsellor, who also was expecting the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.

44. But Pilate wondered that He was dead already, and therefore calling for the centurion he asked him if He had been dead any time:

45. and when he heard it from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.

46. And he bought fine linen, and took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen, and laid Him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock; and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre.

47. And Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Joses observed where He was laid. 

## Mark 16

1. And when the sabbath was past Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices in order to come and embalm Him:

2. and very early in the morning of the first day of the week they come to the sepulchre at sun-rising.

3. And they said to one another, Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the sepulchre?

4. (but when they looked up, they saw that the stone was rolled away,) for it was a very great one.

5. And they went into the sepulchre and saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white robe; and they were affrighted:

6. but he said to them, Be not affrighted, ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified, He is risen, He is not here, see the place where they laid Him.

7. But go, tell his disciples, and Peter particularly, that He is going before you into Galilee: there ye will see Him, as He told you.

8. And they hasted out and fled from the sepulchre; for they were seized with trembling and amazement: neither said they any thing to any one; for they were afraid.

9. Now Jesus being risen early on the first day of the week appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven devils:

10. and she went and told those that used to be with Him, who were mourning and weeping;

11. but they, though they heard that He was indeed alive, and had been seen by her, did not believe it.

12. After this He appeared in another form to two of them as they were walking, going into the country:

13. and they went and told the rest; but they did not believe them neither.

14. At last he appeared to the eleven as they were sitting at table, and upbraided them with their unbelief, and hardness of heart; because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He was risen.

15. And He said unto them, Go to all the world and preach the gospel to every one:

16. he that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be condemned.

17. And these signs shall accompany them that believe; in my name shall they cast out demons, they shall speak with new tongues;

18. they shall take up serpents, and if they should drink any thing poisonous, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall be well.

19. Now the Lord, after He had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.

20. And they went forth and preached every where, the Lord co-operating with them, and confirming the word by miracles following upon it. Amen.
