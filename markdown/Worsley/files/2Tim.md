# 2 Timothy

## 2 Timothy 1

1. Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus,

2. to Timothy my beloved son, grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Lord.

3. I give thanks to God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience, having remembrance of thee continually in my prayers night and day;

4. greatly desiring to see thee, (for I remember thy tears,) that I may be filled with joy:

5. keeping in memory the unfeigned faith, that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice: and I am persuaded that it dwells in thee also;

6. for which cause I remind thee to stir up the gift of God which is in thee through the imposition of my hands.

7. For God hath not given us a spirit of fearfulness, but of vigor, and of love, and of prudence.

8. Be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but bear thy part in the afflictions of the gospel, according to the power of God;

9. who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose, and grace bestowed upon us through Christ Jesus, before the world was,

10. but now made manifest by the appearance of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light by the gospel: for which I was appointed an herald,

11. and an apostle, and a teacher of the gentiles:

12. for which cause also I suffer these things; but I am not ashamed: for I know in whom I have trusted, and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him against that day.

13. Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

14. The good thing committed to thee keep, through the Holy Spirit which dwelleth in us.

15. Thou knowest that all those of Asia are turned from me, of whom is Phygellus and Hermogenes.

16. The Lord shew mercy to the family of Onesiphorus; for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: but when he was at Rome,

17. he sought for me the more diligently, and found me.

18. (The Lord grant that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day!) And how much he ministered to me at Ephesus too, thou knowest full well. 

## 2 Timothy 2

1. Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus:

2. and the things which thou hast heard from me, before many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.

3. Do thou therefore endure hardship, as becomes a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

4. No one, that enters into military service, embarrasseth himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who enlisted him.

5. And if any one contend in the public games, he gains not the crown unless he contend fairly.

6. The husbandman must labour first, in order to partake of the fruits.

7. Consider what I say, and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.

8. Remember Jesus Christ of the seed of David, who was raised from the dead, according to my gospel:

9. for whose sake I suffer trouble even unto bonds, as if I were a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound.

10. Therefore I submit to every thing for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which is by Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.

11. It is an undoubted truth, if we are dead with Him, we shall also live with Him:

12. if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him: if we disown Him, He will also disown us.

13. If we are unfaithful, He continueth faithful notwithstanding; He cannot renounce Himself.

14. These things remind them of, charging them before the Lord not to contend about words, which is profitable for nothing, and tends to the subversion of the hearers.

15. Endeavour to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.

16. But avoid prophane empty harangues; for they will proceed to more impiety,

17. and their discourse will eat like a gangrene. Of whom is Hymeneus and Philetus; who have erred from the truth,

18. saying that the resurrection is already past; and subvert the faith of some.

19. However, the foundation of God standeth firm, having this inscription, The Lord knoweth them that are his; and, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.

20. In a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, some for meaner uses.

21. If therefore any one purify himself from these corruptions, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified and fitted for the Master's use, being prepared for every good work.

22. Flee youthful passions: and follow righteousness, fidelity, love, and peace, with all those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart:

23. but foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they produce quarrels; for the servant of the Lord ought not to wrangle,

24. but to be gentle towards all men, ready to teach, patient under injuries,

25. with meekness instructing those of different sentiments, not knowing but God may give them repentance to the acknowledgement of the truth;

26. and they may awake out of the snare of the devil, who have been captivated by him to his will. 

## 2 Timothy 3

1. But this know, that in the last days there will be difficult times;

2. for men will be selfish, covetous, arrogant, proud, blasphemers, undutiful to parents, ungrateful, unholy,

3. without natural affection, perfidious, false accusers, intemperate, savage, enemies to the good, traitors,

4. headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God,

5. having a form of godliness, but strangers to the power of it: from such turn away.

6. For of these are they who insinuate themselves into families, and captivate weak women, that are laden with sins,

7. and led away by various lusts, always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

8. And as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth; being men of corrupt minds, and of no judgement in the faith.

9. But they shall not proceed far: for their folly shall be evident to all, as theirs also was.

10. But thou art well acquainted with my doctrine, conduct, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience, persecutions,

11. sufferings, which befel me at Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and how the Lord delivered me out of them all.

12. And indeed all, that are desirous to live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution.

13. But wicked men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.

14. But continue thou in the things which thou hast learnt, and been assured of, knowing from whom thou hast learned them;

15. and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through faith in Christ Jesus: for all scripture is by inspiration from God,

16. and is profitable for doctrine, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness;

17. that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly fitted for every good work. 

## 2 Timothy 4

1. I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing, in his kingdom;

2. preach the word, be instant both in season and out of season; convince, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and instruction.

3. For the time will come, when they will not bear sound doctrine; but having itching ears, will heap up to themselves teachers after their own hearts:

4. and turn away their attention from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.

5. But be thou watchful in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, give full proof of thy ministry.

6. For I am now going to be sacrificed, and the time of my dissolution is near.

7. I have fought the good fight, I have finished my race, I have kept the faith.

8. As to what remains, there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me in that day: and not to me only, but also to all those who have longed for his appearance.

9. Endeavour to come to me soon: for Demas hath forsaken me,

10. through love of this world, and is gone to Thessalonica; as is Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia: Luke only is with me.

11. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is useful to me in the ministry.

12. And I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.

13. When thou comest, bring with thee the cloke, that I left at Troas with Carpus; and the books, but especially the parchments.

14. Alexander the brazier did me many ill turns: the Lord will reward him according to his deeds.

15. Of whom do thou also beware: for he hath greatly opposed our doctrine.

16. In my first defence no one stood by me, but all men forsook me: God grant it may not be laid to their charge!

17. But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that by me the gospel might be fully spread, and that all the nations might hear: and so I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

18. And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me to his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory throughout all ages. Amen.

19. Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the family of Onesiphorus.

20. Erastus staid at Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick at Miletus.

21. Endeavour therefore to come to me before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and indeed all the brethren.

22. The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you all. Amen.
