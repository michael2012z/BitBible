# Exodus

## Exodus 1

1. Now these are the names of the children of Israel, that came into Egypt with Jacob, every man and his household they came.

2. Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,

3. Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,

4. Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.

5. And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls; together with Joseph who was already in Egypt.

6. And Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation.

7. And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.

8. Now there rose up a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.

9. And he said unto his people: Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more numerous and mightier than we.

10. Come, let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there happen to be a war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and depart out of the land.

11. And they set over taskmasters, to afflict them with their burdensome labors; and they built treasure cities, for Pharaoh, Pithom and Raamses.

12. But in the measure that they afflicted them, so they multiplied and so they spread out; and they felt abhorrence because of the children of Israel.

13. And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to labor with rigor:

14. And they made their lives bitter with hard labor, in mortar, and in bricks, and in all manner of labor in the field; in all their service, wherein they made them labor with rigor.

15. And the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah;

16. And he said: When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, ye shall look upon the birth; if it be a son, then shall ye kill him; but if it be a daughter, then may she live.

17. But the midwives feared God, and they did not as the king of Egypt had commanded them, but saved the men-children alive.

18. And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and he said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men-children alive?

19. And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively; ere the midwife cometh in unto them they are delivered.

20. And God dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.

21. And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.

22. And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

## Exodus 2

1. And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took a daughter of Levi.

2. And the woman conceived, and bore a son; and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.

3. And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him a box of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it amidst the flags by the brink of the river.

4. And his sister placed herself afar off, to ascertain what would be done to him.

5. And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the side of the river; and when she saw the box among the flags, she sent her maid and fetched it.

6. And she opened it, and saw the child, and, behold, it was a weeping boy; and she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews’ children.

7. Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse for thee the child?

8. And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go; and the maiden went and called the mother of the child.

9. And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take away this child, and nurse him for me, and I will give thee thy wages; and the woman took the child, and nursed him.

10. And the child grew up, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became to her as a son; and she called his name Moses; and she said, Because out of the water have I drawn him.

11. And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdensome labors; and he saw an Egyptian man smiting a Hebrew man, one of his brethren.

12. And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no one by, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.

13. And when he went out the second day, behold, two Hebrew men were striving together; and he said unto him that was in the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?

14. And he said, Who made thee a chief and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou hast killed the Egyptian! And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is become known.

15. And Pharaoh heard this thing, and he sought to slay Moses; but Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and tarried in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.

16. Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.

17. And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses arose and helped them, and watered their flock.

18. And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, Wherefore are ye come home so soon today?

19. And they said, An Egyptian man delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds; and he also drew water for us, and watered the flock.

20. And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? wherefore have ye left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.

21. And Moses was content to dwell with the man; and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses.

22. And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have been a stranger in a foreign land.

23. And it came to pass in this long time, that the king of Egypt died; and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried; and their complaint came up unto God by reason of the bondage.

24. And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

25. And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God took cognizance of them.

## Exodus 3

1. And Moses was keeping the flock of Jithro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock far away into the desert, and came to the mountain of God, to Choreb.

2. And an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a thorn-bush; and he looked, and, behold, the thorn-bush was burning with fire, but the thorn-bush was not consumed.

3. And Moses said, I must turn aside, and see this great sight, why the thorn-bush is not burnt.

4. And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the thorn-bush, and said, Moses, Moses; and he said, Here am I.

5. And he said, Draw not nigh hither; put off thy shoes from off thy feet; for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.

6. And he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look up to God.

7. And the Lord said, I have truly seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard its cry by reason of its taskmasters; yea, I know its sorrows;

8. And I am come down to deliver it out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring it up out of that land unto a land, good and large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Emorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.

9. Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.

10. And now then go, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, and thou shalt bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.

11. And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?

12. And he said, Because I will be with thee; and this shall be unto thee the token, that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.

13. And Moses said unto God, Behold, if I come unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they then say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?

14. And God said unto Moses, I will be that I will be: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I will be hath sent me unto you.

15. And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The Everlasting One, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.

16. Go, and assemble the elders of Israel, and say unto them, The Everlasting One, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, hath appeared unto me, saying, I have surely taken cognizance of you and of that which is done to you in Egypt:

17. And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt, unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Emorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.

18. And they will hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The Everlasting One, the God of the Hebrews hath met with us; and now let us go, we beseech thee, a three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.

19. But I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, unless it happen through a mighty hand.

20. And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof; and after that he will let you go.

21. And I will give this people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians; and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty:

22. But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her that sojourneth in her house, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments; and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall empty out Egypt.

## Exodus 4

1. And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee.

2. And the Lord said unto him, What is that in thy hand? and he said, A staff.

3. And he said, Cast it on the ground; and he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.

4. And the Lord said unto Moses, Put forth thy hand, and grasp it by the tail; and he put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a staff in his hand.

5. In order that they may believe that there hath appeared unto thee the Everlasting One, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

6. And the Lord said farthermore unto him, Do put thy hand into thy bosom: and he put his hand into his bosom; and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, white as snow.

7. And he said, Put thy hand again into thy bosom: and he put his hand again into his bosom; and when he pulled it out of his bosom, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.

8. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.

9. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, and will not hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou shalt take out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.

10. And Moses said unto the Lord, Pardon, O Lord, I am not a man of words, neither yesterday, nor the day before, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant; for I am heavy of speech, and heavy of tongue.

11. And the Lord said unto him, Who hath given a mouth to man? or who maketh him dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? is it not I the Lord?

12. Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and I will teach thee what thou shalt speak.

13. And he said, Pardon, O Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wouldst send.

14. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is there not Aaron, thy brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well; and also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee; and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.

15. And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and I will teach you what ye shall do.

16. And he shall speak for thee unto the people; and he shall be, yea he shall be to thee as a mouth, and thou shalt be to him as a God.

17. And this staff shalt thou take in thy hand, wherewith thou shalt do the signs.

18. And Moses went and returned to Jether his father-in-law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren that are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive; and Jithro said to Moses, Go in peace.

19. And the Lord said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead who sought thy life.

20. And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt; and Moses took the staff of God in his hand.

21. And the Lord said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, regard well all the wonders which I have put in thy hand, and do them before Pharaoh; but I will harden his heart, and he will not let the people go.

22. And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus hath said the Lord, My son, my first-born, is Israel.

23. And I said unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me; and thou refusest to let him go; so, behold, I will slay thy son, thy first-born.

24. And as he was on the journey in the inn, the Lord met him, and sought to kill him.

25. Then took Zipporah a sharp instrument, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody relative art thou to me.

26. And then he withdrew from him; when she said, A bloody relative, but only in respect of the circumcision.

27. And the Lord said to Aaron, Go to meet Moses, into the wilderness; and he went and met him by the mount of God, and kissed him.

28. And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord wherewith he had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.

29. And Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of the children of Israel:

30. And Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses; and he did the signs before the eyes of the people.

31. And the people believed: and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.

## Exodus 5

1. And after that Moses and Aaron went in, and said unto Pharaoh, Thus hath said the Everlasting One, the God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.

2. And Pharaoh said, Who is the Everlasting, whose voice I am to obey, to let Israel go? I know not the Everlasting, nor will I let Israel go.

3. And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, a three days’ journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the Lord our God; lest he fall upon us with the pestilence, or with the sword.

4. And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, hinder the people from their works? get you unto your own affairs.

5. And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye disturb them in the pursuit of their labors.

6. And Pharaoh commanded on the same day the taskmasters of the people, and its officers, saying,

7. Ye shall no more give the people straw to make the bricks, as yesterday and the day before; they themselves shall go and gather themselves straw.

8. And the number of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall impose upon them, ye shall not diminish aught thereof; for they are idle: therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.

9. Let the work be made to lie heavily upon the men, that they may have enough to do therein; and that they may not pay attention to false words.

10. And the taskmasters of the people and its officers went out, and they said to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you any straw.

11. Go ye, get yourselves straw from wherever ye can find it; yet not the least shall be taken off from your work.

12. And the people scattered themselves abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.

13. And the taskmasters were urgent, saying, Fulfill your works, every day its due portion, just as when there was straw.

14. And the officers of the children of Israel, whom the taskmasters of Pharaoh had set over them, were beaten, as these said, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick as heretofore, both yesterday and today?

15. And the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?

16. Straw is not given unto thy servants, and, Make bricks, say they to us: and, behold, thy servants are beaten, and thy people are treated as sinners.

17. But he said, Idle are ye, idle; therefore say ye, Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.

18. And now go, work, and straw shall not be given you; yet the required number of bricks shall ye deliver.

19. And the officers of the children of Israel saw themselves in the evil necessity to say, Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks, every day of its task.

20. And they met Moses and Aaron, standing in their way, as they came forth from Pharaoh.

21. And they said unto them, May the Lord look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.

22. And Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou let so much evil come upon this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?

23. For, since I came unto Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done more evil to this people; but thou hast in nowise delivered thy people.

## Exodus 6

1. Then said the Lord unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh; for with a strong hand shall he send them away, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.

2. And God spoke unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord:

3. And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God, the Almighty, but by my name The Eternal was I not made known to them.

4. And as I did also establish my covenant with them, to give unto them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they sojourned:

5. So have I also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians compel to labor; and I have remembered my covenant.

6. Therefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the Eternal, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will release you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments:

7. And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you for a God; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God, who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

8. And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning which I did lift up my hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage: I am the Lord.

9. And Moses spoke thus unto the children of Israel; but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.

10. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,

11. Go in, speak unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, that he shall let the children of Israel go out of his land.

12. And Moses spoke before the Lord, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me: how then shall Pharaoh hear me, whereas I am of uncircumcised lips?

13. And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to bring forth the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

14. These are the heads of their family divisions: The sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel: Chanoch, and Pallu, Chezron, and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben.

15. And the sons of Simeon: Yemuel, and Yamin, and Ohad, and Yachin, and Zochar, and Shaul the son of the Canaanitish woman; these are the families of Simeon.

16. And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, and Kehath, and Merari; and the years of the life of Levi were one hundred and thirty and seven years.

17. The sons of Gershon: Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.

18. And the sons of Kehath: Amram, and Yizhar, and Chebron, and ‘Uzziel; and the years of the life of Kehath were one hundred and thirty and three years.

19. And the sons of Merari: Machli and Mushi; these are the families of Levi according to their generations.

20. And Amram took himself Yochebed his aunt for wife; and she bore unto him Aaron and Moses; and the years of the life of Amram were one hundred and thirty and seven years.

21. And the sons of Yizhar: Korach, and Nepheg, and Zichri.

22. And the sons of ‘Uzziah Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri,

23. And Aaron took himself Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Nachshon, for wife; and she bore unto him Nadab, and Abihu, Elazar, and Ithamar.

24. And the sons of Korach: Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiassaph; these are the families of the Korchites.

25. And Elazar the son of Aaron took himself one of the daughters of Putiel for wife; and she bore unto him Phinehas: these are the heads of the divisions of the Levites according to their families.

26. These are Aaron and Moses, to whom the Lord said, Bring forth the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt according to their armies.

27. These are they that spoke to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, to bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt: these are Moses and Aaron.

28. And it came to pass on the day when the Lord spoke unto Moses in the land of Egypt.

29. Then spoke the Lord unto Moses, saying, I am the Lord; speak thou unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt all that I speak unto thee.

30. And Moses said before the Lord, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?

## Exodus 7

1. And the Lord said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.

2. Thou shalt speak all that I shall command thee; and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send away the children of Israel out of his land.

3. And I will harden the heart of Pharaoh, and I will multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.

4. And Pharaoh will not hearken unto you, and I will lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth my armies, my people, the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by means of great judgments.

5. And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I stretch forth my hand over Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from the midst of them.

6. And Moses and Aaron did so; as the Lord commanded them, so did they.

7. And Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty and three years old, when they spoke unto Pharaoh.

8. And the Lord said unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

9. If Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Show a miracle for yourselves: then shalt thou say unto Aaron, Take thy staff and cast it down before Pharaoh; it shall become a serpent.

10. And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so, as the Lord had commanded; and Aaron cast down his staff before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.

11. Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers; and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did with their secret arts in like manner.

12. And they cast down every man his staff, and they became serpents; but Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staves.

13. But the heart of Pharaoh was hard, and he hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had spoken.

14. And the Lord said unto Moses, The heart of Pharaoh is obdurate, he refuseth to let the people go.

15. Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt place thyself opposite to him by the brink of the river; and the staff which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thy hand.

16. And thou shalt say unto him, The Eternal, the God of the Hebrews, hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, thou wouldst not hear, up to this time.

17. Thus hath said the Lord, By this thou shalt know that I am the Lord: behold, I will smite with the staff that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.

18. And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall loath to drink water from the river.

19. And the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy staff, and stretch out thy hand over the waters of Egypt, over their streams, over their rivers, and over their ponds, and over all their pools of water, that they become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, also in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.

20. And Moses and Aaron did so, as the Lord had commanded; and he lifted up his hand with the staff, and smote the waters that were in the river, before the eyes of Pharaoh, and before the eyes of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.

21. And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.

22. And the magicians of Egypt did so with their secret arts: and the heart of Pharaoh remained hardened, and he did not hearken unto them; as the Lord had spoken.

23. And Pharaoh turned away and went into his house, and he did not set his heart to this thing also.

24. And all the Egyptians dug in the neighborhood of the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.

25. And full seven days elapsed, after that the Lord had smitten the river. And the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus hath said the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serve me. And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs: And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, and they shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy sleeping-chamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and among thy people, and into thy ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs; And upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants, shall the frogs come up.

## Exodus 8

1. And the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy staff over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause the frogs to come up over the land of Egypt.

2. And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.

3. And the magicians did so with their secret arts, and brought up the frogs over the land of Egypt.

4. Then did Pharaoh call for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the Lord, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice unto the Lord.

5. And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Arrogate thyself glory over me: for what time shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and from thy houses, that they may remain in the river only?

6. And he said, For tomorrow; and he said, Be it according to thy word; in order that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the Lord our God.

7. And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; only in the river shall they remain.

8. And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried unto the Lord on account of the frogs which he had inflicted on Pharaoh.

9. And the Lord did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.

10. And they gathered them together in many heaps; and the land stank.

11. But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had spoken.

12. And the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy staff, and smite the dust of the earth, and it shall become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.

13. And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff, and smote the dust of the earth, and the lice were thus on man, and on beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.

14. And the magicians did so with their secret arts to bring forth the lice, but they could not; so were the lice upon man and upon beast.

15. Then said the magicians unto Pharaoh, This is a finger of God; but Pharaoh’s heart remained hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had spoken.

16. And the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and place thyself before Pharaoh; lo, he goeth forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus hath said the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

17. For if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send against thee, and against thy servants, and against thy people, and into thy houses various wild beasts: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of the wild beasts, and also the ground whereon they dwell.

18. And I will distinguish on that day the land of Goshen, in which my people abideth, so that no wild beasts shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth.

19. And I will put a distinction between my people and thy people; tomorrow shall this sign be.

20. And the Lord did so; and there came a grievous multitude of beasts into the house of Pharaoh, and into the house of his servants; and in all the land of Egypt, the land was laid waste by reason of the wild beasts.

21. And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.

22. And Moses said, It is not proper to do so; for the abomination of the Egyptians must we sacrifice to the Eternal our God: lo, if we should sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, would they not stone us?

23. A three days’ journey will we go into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the Lord our God, just as he may say unto us.

24. And Pharaoh said, I will surely let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the Eternal your God in the wilderness; only do not go very far away: entreat for me.

25. And Moses said, Behold, I am going out from thee, and I will entreat the Lord, and the wild beasts shall depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow; only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more, so as not to let the people go to sacrifice to the Lord.

26. And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the Lord.

27. And the Lord did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the wild beasts from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.

28. But Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, and he did not let the people go.

## Exodus 9

1. And the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and speak to him, Thus hath said the Eternal, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

2. For if thou refusest to let them go, and still holdest on to them,

3. Behold, the hand of the Lord will be sent against thy cattle which is in the field, against the horses, against the asses, against the camels, against the oxen, and against the sheep; —a very grievous pestilence.

4. And the Lord will distinguish between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; and not one head shall die of all that belongeth to the children of Israel.

5. And the Lord appointed a set time, saying, Tomorrow will the Lord do this thing in the land.

6. And the Lord did this thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died; but of the cattle of the children of Israel there died not one.

7. And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there had not died of the cattle of the Israelites even one; but the heart of Pharaoh remained hardened, and he did not let the people go.

8. And the Lord said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take unto yourselves your hands full of soot of the furnace, and let Moses throw it heavenward before the eyes of Pharaoh.

9. And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall become upon man and beast an inflammation, producing boils, throughout all the land of Egypt.

10. And they took the soot of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses threw it up heavenward; and it became an inflammation, producing boils, upon man, and upon beast.

11. And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the inflammation; for the inflammation was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.

12. And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had spoken unto Moses.

13. And the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and place thyself before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus hath said the Eternal, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

14. For at this time I send all my plagues against thy heart, and against thy servants, and against thy people; in order that thou mayest know that there is none like me on all the earth.

15. For even now I might have stretched out my hand, and I might have smitten thee and thy people with the pestilence; and thou wouldst have been cut off from the earth;

16. But for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.

17. If thou dost yet wantonly oppress my people, so as not to let them go:

18. Behold, then will I let rain, about this time tomorrow, a very grievous hail, the like of which hath not been in Egypt since the day of its foundation even until now.

19. And now send, and bring under shelter thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for every man and beast that shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought into the house, upon them shall the hail come down, and they shall die.

20. He that feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses;

21. And he that regarded not the word of the Lord left his servants and his cattle in the field.

22. And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven, and there shall be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, in the land of Egypt.

23. And Moses stretched forth his staff toward heaven; and the Lord sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran down to the ground; and the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt.

24. And there was hail, and fire was flaming up amidst the hail, very grievous, the like of which had not been in all the land of Egypt, since it had become a nation.

25. And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and every herb of the field did the hail smite, and every tree of the field did it break.

26. Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail.

27. And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and he said unto them, I have sinned this time; the Eternal is the righteous, and I and my people are the wicked.

28. Entreat the Lord that there may be no more of the thunders of God, and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall no longer stay here.

29. And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands unto the Lord: the thunders shall cease, and the hail shall not be any more; in order that thou mayest know how that to the Lord belongeth the earth.

30. But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye are not yet afraid before the Lord God.

31. And the flax and the barley were smitten; for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled.

32. But the wheat and the millet were not smitten; for they are late-ripening.

33. And Moses went away from Pharaoh out of the city, and spread out his hands unto the Lord: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured out upon the earth.

34. And when Pharaoh saw that the rain, and the hail, and the thunders had ceased, he sinned yet farther, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.

35. And the heart of Pharaoh remained hardened, and he did not let the children of Israel go; as the Lord had spoken by the hand of Moses.

## Exodus 10

1. And the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh; for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, in order that I might display these my signs in the midst of them:

2. And in order that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son’s son, the wonders which I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have shown among them; and ye shall know now that I am the Lord.

3. And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the Eternal, the God of the Hebrews, How long yet wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.

4. For, if thou refusest to let my people go, behold, I will bring tomorrow locusts into thy boundary.

5. And they shall cover the face of the earth, so that one shall not be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which escaped, which hath been left unto you from the hail, and they shall eat off every tree which groweth for you out of the field:

6. And thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians shall be full of them; such as neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day of their being upon the earth, until this day; and he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.

7. And the servants of Pharaoh said unto him, How long shall this man be unto us for a snare? let the men go, that they may serve the Lord their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?

8. And Moses was brought back with Aaron unto Pharaoh; and he said unto them, Go ye, serve the Lord your God; who all are they that shall go?

9. And Moses said, With our young and with our old will we go; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we are to hold a feast unto the Lord.

10. And he said unto them, So be the Lord with you, as I will let you go, together with your little ones: look, surely your intentions are evil.

11. Not so; go now ye men, and serve the Lord, for this you desire: and they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.

12. And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, and they shall come up over the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the earth, all that the hail hath left.

13. And Moses stretched forth his staff over the land of Egypt, and the Lord urged an east wind over the land all that day, and all the night; when it was morning, the east wind bore along the locusts.

14. And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the boundaries of Egypt; in very large masses; before them there were no such locusts as they, and after them there will not be any such.

15. And they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the earth was darkened; and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there was not left any green thing on the trees, or on the herbs of the field, throughout all the land of Egypt.

16. Then made Pharaoh haste to call for Moses and Aaron; and he said, I have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you.

17. And now forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the Lord your God, that he may take away from me only this death.

18. And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the Lord.

19. And the Lord turned a very strong west wind, which bore away the locusts, and cast them into the Red Sea; there was not left one locust in all the boundary of Egypt.

20. But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that he did not let the children of Israel go.

21. And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward heaven, and there shall be darkness over the land of Egypt, and it shall be a darkness of the night.

22. And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:

23. They saw not one another, neither did they rise, any one from his place, for three days; but for all the children of Israel there was light in their dwellings.

24. And Pharaoh called for Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the Lord; only your flocks and your herds shall remain behind: also your little ones may go with you.

25. And Moses said, Even thou also must give into our hand sacrifices and burnt-offerings, that we may sacrifice them unto the Eternal, our God.

26. And also our cattle must go with us, there shall not be left behind a single hoof, for thereof must we take to serve the Lord our God; and we cannot know with what we must serve the Lord, until we come thither.

27. But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go.

28. And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee away from me; take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for on the day thou seest my face thou shalt die.

29. And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will not see thy face again any more.

## Exodus 11

1. And the Lord said unto Moses, Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; after that he will let you go hence: when he doth let you go, he shall surely thrust you out altogether from here.

2. Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold.

3. And the Lord gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians; also the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh’s servants, and in the eyes of the people.

4. And Moses said, Thus hath said the Lord, About midnight will I go out in the midst of Egypt:

5. And there shall die every first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that is to sit upon his throne, even unto the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill; and every first-born of cattle.

6. And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, the like of which hath never been, and the like of which will not be any more.

7. But against any of the children of Israel not a dog shall move his tongue, neither against man nor beast; in order that ye may know how that the Lord doth distinguish between the Egyptians and Israel.

8. And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow themselves down unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that followeth thee; and after that I will go out: and he went out from Pharaoh in a burning anger.

9. And the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh will not hearken unto you; in order that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.

10. And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go out of his land.

## Exodus 12

1. And the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,

2. This month shall be unto you the chief of months: the first shall it be unto you of the months of the year.

3. Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, On the tenth day of this month they shall take to themselves every man a lamb for every family, a lamb for every house:

4. And if the household be too small for a lamb, then shall he take it with his neighbor who is next unto his house, according to the number of the souls; every man according to what he eateth shall ye make a count for the lamb.

5. A lamb without blemish, a male of the first year shall ye have; from the sheep, or from the goats may ye take it.

6. And ye shall have it in keeping until the fourteenth day of the same month; and then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it toward evening.

7. And they shall take of the blood, and put it on the two side-posts and on the upper door-post, in the houses, wherein they shall eat it.

8. And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted by the fire, with unleavened bread; together with bitter herbs shall they eat it.

9. You shall not eat of it raw, nor in any wise sodden with water; but roasted by the fire; its head with its legs, and with its entrails.

10. And ye shall not let any thing of it remain until morning; and that which remaineth of it until morning ye shall burn with fire.

11. And thus shall ye eat it, With your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste, it is passover unto the Lord.

12. And I will pass through the land of Egypt in this night, and I will smite every first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt will I execute judgments: I am the Lord.

13. And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you; and there shall be no plague against you to destroy, when I smite others in the land of Egypt.

14. And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall celebrate it as a feast unto the Lord; throughout your generations, as an ordinance for ever shall ye celebrate it.

15. Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; but on the first day ye shall have put away leaven out of your houses; for whosoever eateth leavened bread, that soul shall be cut off from Israel, from the first day until the seventh day.

16. And on the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and on the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done on them, save what is eaten by every man, that only may be prepared by you.

17. And ye shall observe the unleavened bread; for on this selfsame day have I brought forth your armies out of the land of Egypt; therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations as an ordinance for ever.

18. In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, shall ye eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at evening.

19. Seven days no leaven shall be found in your houses; for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or one born in the land.

20. Nothing that is leavened shall ye eat; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.

21. And Moses called for the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take for yourselves lambs according to your families, and kill the passover sacrifice.

22. And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out frown the door of his house until the morning.

23. And the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, the Lord will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite.

24. And ye shall observe this thing, as an ordinance for thee and for thy sons for ever.

25. And it shall come to pass, when ye be come into the land which the Lord will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.

26. And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?

27. That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the passover unto the Lord, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and our houses he spared; and the people bent the head and bowed themselves.

28. And the children of Israel went away, and did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

29. And it came to pass at midnight, that the Lord smote every first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that was to sit on his throne unto the first-born of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the first-born of cattle.

30. And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not some one dead.

31. And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the Eternal, as ye have spoken.

32. Also your flocks and your herds take, as ye have spoken, and be gone; and bless me also.

33. And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, to make haste to send them away out of the land; for they said, We are all dying.

34. And the people took up their dough before it was yet leavened, their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.

35. And the children of Israel had done according to the word of Moses; and they had asked of the Egyptians vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments.

36. And the Lord had given the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, so that they gave unto them what they required; and they emptied out Egypt.

37. And the children of Israel journeyed from Ra’meses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, beside children.

38. And a mixed multitude also went up with them; and flocks, and herds, a very large amount of cattle.

39. And they baked of the dough, which they had brought forth out of Egypt, unleavened cakes, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared any provisions for themselves.

40. Now the time of the residence of the children of Israel, which they dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.

41. And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, and it happened even on the selfsame day, that all the armies of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt.

42. A night to be observed was this unto the Lord to bring them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night holy to the Lord, to be observed by all the children of Israel in their generations.

43. And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: No stranger shall eat thereof.

44. But every man’s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.

45. A resident foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof.

46. In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house; and no bone shall ye break in it.

47. All the congregation of Israel shall prepare it.

48. And when a stranger sojourneth with thee, and will prepare the passover to the Lord, let his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and prepare it, and he shall be as one that is born in the land; but no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.

49. One law shall be to him that is home-born, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.

50. And all the children of Israel did so; as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

51. And it came to pass on the selfsame day, that the Lord did bring forth the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.

## Exodus 13

1. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,

2. Sanctify unto me all the first-born, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.

3. And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, on which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of slavery; for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from here: and no leavened bread shall be eaten.

4. This day go ye out, in the month of Abib.

5. And it shall be, when the Lord doth bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Emorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he hath sworn unto thy fathers to give unto thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt perform this service in this month.

6. Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day shall be a feast to the Lord.

7. Unleavened bread shall be eaten these seven days; and there shall not be seen with thee any leavened bread, neither shall there be seen with thee any leaven in all thy boundaries.

8. And thou shalt tell thy son on that day, saying, This is done for the sake of that which the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.

9. And it shall be unto thee for a sign upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thy eyes, in order that the law of the Lord may be in thy mouth; for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought thee forth out of Egypt.

10. And thou shalt keep this ordinance in its season, from year to year.

11. And it shall be, when the Lord doth bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he hath sworn unto thee and to thy fathers, and giveth it to thee,

12. That thou shalt set apart all that openeth the womb unto the Lord; and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou shalt have, the males, shall belong to the Lord.

13. And every firstling of an ass shalt thou redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then shalt thou break its neck: and all the first-born of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.

14. And it shall be, when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery;

15. And it came to pass, when Pharaoh obstinately refused to let us go, that the Lord slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man, and the first-born of beast; therefore do I sacrifice to the Lord all that openeth the womb, being males; but all the first-born of my children must I redeem.

16. And it shall be for a sign upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thy eyes; that by strength of hand the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt.

17. And it came to pass, when Pharaoh let the people go, that God did not lead them the way through the land of the Philistines, because it was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and return to Egypt.

18. But God led the people about, by the way of the wilderness to the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.

19. And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him; for he had caused the children of Israel to swear, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall then carry up my bones away hence with you.

20. And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, at the edge of the wilderness.

21. And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give light to them; that they might go by day and by night:

22. He took not away the pillar of cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.

## Exodus 14

1. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,

2. Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pi-hachiroth, between Migdol and the sea; in front of Baal-zephon; opposite to this shall ye encamp by the sea.

3. And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.

4. And I will harden the heart of Pharaoh, that he shall follow after them; and I will get myself honor on Pharaoh, and on all his host; and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord; and they did so.

5. And it was told to the king of Egypt that the people had fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed with respect to the people, and they said, What is this which we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?

6. And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him.

7. And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.

8. And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel; and the children of Israel went out with a high hand.

9. And the Egyptians pursued after them, and they overtook them encamping by the sea, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, beside Pi-hachiroth, before Baal-zephon.

10. And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians were marching after them, and they were greatly afraid; and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord.

11. And they said unto Moses, Is it because there were no graves in Egypt, that thou hast taken us away to die in the wilderness? what is this which thou hast done to us, to bring us forth out of Egypt?

12. Is not this the word that we spoke unto thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? for it is better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness.

13. And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will do for you today; for as ye have seen the Egyptians today, ye shall not see them again any more for ever.

14. The Lord will fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.

15. And the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward;

16. But do thou lift up thy staff, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it; and the children of Israel shall go through the midst of the sea on dry ground.

17. And I, behold, I will harden the heart of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get myself honor on Pharaoh, and on all his host, on his chariots, and on his horsemen.

18. And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I have got myself honor on Pharaoh, on his chariots, and on his horsemen.

19. And the angel of God, that went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud removed from before them, and stood behind them;

20. And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to the first, but it gave light by night to these: and the one came not near unto the other all the night.

21. And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord drove back the sea with a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.

22. And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them, on their right hand, and on their left.

23. And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them, all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen, to the midst of the sea.

24. And it came to pass in the morning watch, that the Lord looked unto the camp of the Egyptians with the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and brought into confusion the camp of the Egyptians;

25. And he took off the wheels of their chariots, and caused them to move onward with difficulty; and the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians.

26. And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, and the waters shall return over the Egyptians, over their chariots, and over their horsemen.

27. And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned, when the morning appeared, to its strength; while the Egyptians were fleeing against it; and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.

28. And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen with all the host of Pharaoh that came after them into the sea: there remained of them not even one.

29. But the children of Israel walked upon dry ground in the midst of the sea; and the waters were unto them a wall on their right hand, and on their left.

30. Thus the Lord saved Israel on that day out of the land of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the shore of the sea.

31. And Israel saw that great power which the Lord had shown on the Egyptians: and the people feared the Lord, and then believed in the Lord, and in Moses his servant.

## Exodus 15

1. Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord, and thus did they say, I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

2. My strength and song is the Lord, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will declare his praise, the God of my father, and I will exalt him.

3. The Eternal is the Lord of war; the Eternal is his name.

4. The chariots of Pharaoh and his host hath he hurled into the sea; and the chosen of his captains are sunk in the Red Sea.

5. The depths have covered them; they went down to the bottom as a stone.

6. Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power; thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.

7. And in the greatness of thy excellency hast thou overthrown those that rose up against thee; thou didst send forth thy wrath, it consumed them as stubble.

8. And with the breath of thy nostrils the waters were heaped up together, the floods stood upright as a wall; congealed were the depths in the heart of the sea.

9. The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my desire shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.

10. Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sunk as lead in mighty waters.

11. Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the mighty? who is like unto thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?

12. Thou didst stretch out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.

13. Thou leadest forth in thy kindness the people thou hast redeemed; thou guidest it in thy strength unto the habitation of thy holiness.

14. Nations hear it and tremble: sorrow seizeth the inhabitants of Palestine.

15. Then were troubled the dukes of Edom; the mighty men of Moab, trembling seizeth them; faint-hearted become all the inhabitants of Canaan. l

16. Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thy arm they shall be still as a stone: till thy people pass over, O Lord, till this people pass over, which thou hast purchased.

17. Thou wilt bring them, and plant them on the mountain of thy inheritance, the place, O Lord, which thou hast wrought for thy residence, the sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.

18. The Lord will reign for ever and ever.

19. For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought again upon them the waters of the sea; but the children of Israel went on dry ground through the midst of the sea.

20. Then took Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.

21. And Miriam began her song to them, Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

22. And Moses caused Israel to depart from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.

23. And they came to Marah; but they could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter; therefore they called its name Marah.

24. And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?

25. And he cried unto the Lord; and the Lord showed him a tree, which he cast into the waters, and the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them.

26. And he said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his eyes, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and wilt keep all his statutes: I will put none of those diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians; for I the Lord am thy physician.

27. And they came to Elim, and there were twelve wells of water, and seventy palm-trees: and they encamped there by the water.

## Exodus 16

1. And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.

2. And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:

3. And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God that we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pot, when we ate bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.

4. Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will let rain for you bread from heaven; and the people shall go out and gather a certain portion every day, in order that I may prove it, whether it will walk in my law, or not.

5. And it shall come to pass, on the sixth day, when they prepare what they shall have brought in, that it shall be twice as much as they shall gather daily.

6. And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At evening, then shall ye know that it is the Lord who hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:

7. And in the morning, then shall ye see the glory of the Lord; since he heareth your murmurings against the Lord; and what are we, that ye should murmur against us?

8. And Moses said, When the Lord giveth you in the evening flesh to eat, and bread in the morning to the full; since the Lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him:—what are we then? not against us are your murmurings, but against the Lord.

9. And Moses said unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the Lord; for he hath heard your murmurings.

10. And it came to pass, as Aaron was speaking unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they turned round toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud.

11. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,

12. I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, Toward evening ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the Eternal your God.

13. And it came to pass, that at evening the quails came up, and covered the camp; and in the morning there was a layer of dew round about the camp.

14. And when the layer of dew was gone up, behold, there was upon the face of the wilderness something fine in grains, small as the hoar-frost, on the ground.

15. And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna, for they knew not what it was; and Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.

16. This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating: an omer for every head, according to the number of your persons that every man hath in his tent, shall ye take.

17. And the children of Israel did so; and they gathered, some much, some little.

18. And when they measured it with an omer, he that had gathered much had nothing over, and he that had gathered little had no lack: every man according to his eating, had they gathered.

19. And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.

20. But they hearkened not unto Moses; but some men left of it until morning, and it bred worms, and stank; and Moses was wroth with them.

21. And so they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating; and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.

22. And it came to pass on the sixth day, that they gathered twofold bread, two omers for every one; all the rulers of the congregation came and told it to Moses.

23. And he said unto them. This is what the Lord hath spoken, A rest, a holy rest is unto the Lord tomorrow: that which ye will bake bake today, and what ye will seethe seethe today; and all the remaining lay up for you to be kept until the morning.

24. And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses had bidden; and it did not stink, nor was there any worm therein.

25. And Moses said, Eat it today; for a sabbath is this day unto the Lord: today ye will not find it in the field.

26. Six days shall ye gather it; but on the seventh day, the sabbath, on it there shall be none.

27. And it came to pass on the seventh day, that there went out some of the people to gather; but they found nothing.

28. And the Lord said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?

29. See, that the Lord hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day bread for two days; remain ye, every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.

30. So the people rested on the seventh day.

31. And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna, [Man] ; and it was like coriander-seed, white, and its taste was like wafers made with honey.

32. And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, One omer-full of it is to be kept for your generations; in order that they may see the bread which I gave you to eat in the wilderness, when I brought you forth out of the land of Egypt.

33. And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a flask, and put therein an omer-full of manna, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your generations.

34. As the Lord had commanded Moses, so did Aaron lay it up before the Testimony, to be kept.

35. And the children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land; the manna they did eat, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.

36. But the omer is a tenth part of an ephah.

## Exodus 17

1. And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeyings, by the order of the Lord; and they encamped in Rephidim, and there was no water for the people to drink.

2. And the people quarrelled with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink; and Moses said unto them, Why will ye quarrel with me? why will ye tempt the Lord?

3. And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, For what purpose is it that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill me and my children and my cattle with thirst?

4. And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, What shall I do unto this people? but little is wanting and they will stone me.

5. And the Lord said unto Moses, Pass on before the people, and take with thee some of the elders of Israel; and thy staff, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go.

6. Behold, I will be standing before thee there upon the rock at Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come out from it water, and the people shall drink; and Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel.

7. And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah; because of the quarrelling of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the Lord, saying, Is then the Lord among us, or not?

8. Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.

9. And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose for us men, and go out, fight with Amalek; tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.

10. And Joshua did as Moses had said to him, to fight with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Chur went up to the top of the hill.

11. And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, that Amalek prevailed.

12. But when the hands of Moses became heavy, they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Chur supported his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.

13. And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.

14. And the Lord said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in the book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua; for I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens.

15. And Moses built an altar, and called its name Adonay Nissy [The Lord is my Banner].

16. And he said, Because the Lord hath sworn on his throne, that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

## Exodus 18

1. And Jithro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, that the Lord had brought forth Israel out of Egypt.

2. Then took Jithro, the father-in-law of Moses, Zipporah, the wife of Moses, after he had sent her back,

3. And her two sons; of whom the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been a stranger in a foreign land:

4. And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.

5. And Jithro, the father-in-law of Moses, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses, unto the wilderness, where he was encamped at the mount of God.

6. And he sent word unto Moses, I thy father-in-law Jithro am coming unto thee, with thy wife, and her two sons with her.

7. And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed himself, and kissed him; and they asked each other after their welfare; and they went into the tent.

8. And Moses told his father-in-law all which the Lord had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians on account of Israel, all the hardship which had come upon them by the way, and how the Lord had delivered them.

9. And Jithro rejoiced over all the goodness which the Lord had done to Israel, that he had delivered it out of the hand of the Egyptians.

10. And Jithro said, Blessed be the Lord, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.

11. Now I know that the Eternal is great above all gods; for by the very thing wherein they sinned presumptuously was punishment brought upon them.

12. And Jithro, the father-in-law of Moses, offered a burnt-offering and sacrifices unto God; and Aaron came, with all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with the father-in-law of Moses, before God.

13. And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people; and the people stood around Moses from the morning unto the evening.

14. And the father-in-law of Moses saw all that he did to the people; and he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people standeth around thee from morning until evening?

15. And Moses said unto his father-in-law, Because the people cometh unto me to inquire of God.

16. When they have a matter of dispute, they come unto me; and I judge between one and the other, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.

17. And the father-in-law of Moses said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.

18. Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee; for the thing is too heavy for thee; thou wilt not be able to perform it by thyself alone.

19. Now hearken unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and may God be with thee, Be thou for the people a mediator with God, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God.

20. And thou shalt explain to them the statutes and the laws; and thou shalt make them know the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.

21. Moreover, thou shalt select out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating their own gain; and place these over them, as rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

22. And let them judge the people at all times; and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge themselves: so shall it be easier for thee, when they shall bear with thee.

23. If thou wilt do this thing, and God commandeth it thee, then wilt thou be able to endure; and also the whole of this people will come to its place in peace.

24. And Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.

25. And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and placed them as heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

26. And they judged the people at all times; any difficult cause they brought unto Moses, but every small cause they judged themselves.

27. And Moses dismissed his father-in-law; and he went his way unto his own land.

## Exodus 19

1. In the third month, after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.

2. For they had departed from Rephidim, and they came to the desert of Sinai, and encamped in the wilderness; and Israel encamped there opposite the mount.

3. And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord called unto him from the mount, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel.

4. Ye have yourselves seen what I have done unto the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself.

5. Now therefore, if you will truly obey my voice, and keep my covenant, then shall ye be unto me a peculiar treasure above all nations; for all the earth is mine:

6. And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation; these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.

7. And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before them all these words which the Lord had commanded him.

8. And all the people answered unanimously, and said, all that the Lord hath spoken will we do; and Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord.

9. And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, I will come unto thee in a thick cloud, for the sake that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and that also in thee they shall believe for ever; and Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord.

10. And the Lord said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes.

11. And they shall be ready against the third day; for on the third day will the Lord come down, before the eyes of all the people, upon mount Sinai.

12. And thou shalt set bounds unto the people, round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, nor touch the border of it; whosoever toucheth the mount shall surely be put to death.

13. Yet not a hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live; when the trumpet soundeth long, they may come up to the mount.

14. And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people: and they washed their clothes.

15. And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day; approach not unto a woman.

16. And it came to pass on the third day when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a heavy cloud was upon the mount, and the voice of the cornet was exceedingly loud; so that all the people that were in the camp trembled.

17. And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they placed themselves at the foot of the mount.

18. And mount Sinai smoked in every part, because the Lord had descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.

19. And the voice of the cornet went on, and waxed louder and louder; Moses spoke, and God answered him with a loud voice.

20. And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount; and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount, and Moses went up.

21. And the Lord said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the Lord to gaze, and many of them might perish.

22. And the priests also, who come near to the Lord, shall sanctify themselves; lest the Lord break forth among them.

23. And Moses said unto the Lord, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai; for thou hast charged us, saying, Set bounds about the mount and sanctify it.

24. And the Lord said unto him, Go, get thee down, and then shalt thou come up, thou, and Aaron with thee; but the priests and the people shall not break through to come up unto the Lord, lest he break forth among them.

25. So Moses went down unto the people, and spoke unto them.

## Exodus 20

1. And God spoke all these words, saying,

2. I am the Lord thy God, who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

3. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

4. Thou shalt not make unto thyself any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

5. Thou shalt not bow thyself down to them, nor serve them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;

6. And showing mercy unto the thousandth generation of them that love me, and keep my commandments.

7. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

8. Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy.

9. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work.

10. But the seventh day is the sabbath in honor of the Lord thy God; on it thou shalt not do any work, neither thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates;

11. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

12. Honor thy father and thy mother; in order that thy days may be prolonged upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

13. Thou shalt not kill.

14. Thou shalt not commit adultery.

15. Thou shalt not steal.

16. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

17. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor’s.

18. And all the people perceived the thunders, and the lightnings, and the sound of the cornet, and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw it, they removed trembling, and stood afar off.

19. And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die.

20. And Moses said unto the people, Fear not; for in order to prove you, did God come, and in order that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.

21. And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.

22. And the Lord said unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that from heaven I have spoken with you.

23. Ye shall not make any thing with me; gods of silver, and gods of gold ye shall not make unto yourselves.

24. An altar of earth shalt thou make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep, and thy oxen; in every place where I shall permit my name to be mentioned, I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.

25. And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.

26. Neither shalt thou go up by steps upon my altar, that thy nakedness be not laid open thereon.

## Exodus 21

1. And these are the laws of justice which thou shalt set before them.

2. If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years shall he serve; and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.

3. If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he was the husband of a woman, then shall his wife go out with him.

4. If his master should give him a wife, and she bear him sons or daughters: the wife and her children shall belong to her master, and he shall go out by himself.

5. And if the servant should plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:

6. Then shall his master bring him unto the judges, and he shall bring him to the door, or unto the door-post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him till the jubilee.

7. And if a man sell his daughter for a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants go out.

8. If she please not her master, to whom he hath assigned her, then shall he aid her to be redeemed: unto a strange nation he shall have no power to sell her, seeing he hath dealt faithlessly with her.

9. And if he should assign her unto his son, then shall he do unto her after the right of the daughters.

10. If he take himself another wife, her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.

11. And if he do not these three things unto her, then shall she go out free, without money.

12. He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall surely be put to death.

13. And if he did not lie in wait, but God let it come into his hand, then will I appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.

14. But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile, from my altar shalt thou take him, that he may die.

15. And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.

16. And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, and he be found in his hand, shall surely be put to death.

17. And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.

18. And if men strive together, and one smite the other with a stone, or with the fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:

19. If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his crutch, then shall he that smote him be quit; only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.

20. And if a man smite his servant or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand, it shall be surely avenged.

21. Nevertheless, if he continue alive a day or two, it shall not be avenged; for he is his money.

22. If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her children depart from her, and yet no farther mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, with a fine, according as the husband of the woman will lay upon him; and he shall pay this by the decision of the judges.

23. And if any mischief follow, then shalt thou give life for life.

24. Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

25. Burning for burning, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.

26. And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish, he shall let him go free for the sake of his eye.

27. And if he strike out his man-servant’s tooth, or his maid-servant’s tooth, he shall let him go free for the sake of his tooth.

28. If an ox gore a man or a woman, that he die: then shall the ox be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.

29. But if the ox were wont to gore in time past, and warning have been given to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, and he killeth a man or a woman: the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also should of right be put to death;

30. But there shall be laid on him a sum of money in atonement, and he shall give the ransom of his life whatsoever may be laid upon him.

31. If he gore a son, or gore a daughter, according to this judgment shall be done unto him.

32. If the ox gore a man-servant or a maid-servant, thirty shekels of silver shall he give to his master, and the ox shall be stoned.

33. And if a man open a pit, or if a man dig a pit, and do not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein:

34. The owner of the pit shall make it good, he shall make restitution in money unto the owner thereof; and the dead beast shall be his.

35. And if one man’s ox hurt the ox of another, that he die: then shall they sell the live ox, and divide his money; and the dead ox also they shall divide.

36. But if it be known that the ox was wont to gore in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in: he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall belong to him. If a man steal an ox or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it: five oxen shall he restore for one ox, and four sheep for one sheep.

## Exodus 22

1. If a thief be found while breaking in, and be smitten so that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him.

2. If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; he shall make full restitution; if he have nothing, then shall he be sold for his theft.

3. If the thing stolen be actually found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep, he shall restore double.

4. If a man cause a field or vineyard to be eaten off, and he let his beasts enter, and they feed in another man’s field; with the best of his own field, and with best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.

5. If a fire break out, and meet with thorns, so that stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed thereby, he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.

6. If a man do deliver unto his neighbor money or vessels to keep, and it be stolen out of the man’s house: if the thief be found, he shall pay double.

7. If the thief be not found, then shall the master of the house be brought unto the judges, to swear that he have not stretched out his hand against his neighbor’s goods.

8. For all manner of trespass, for ox, for ass, for lamb, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, of which he can say, This is it, before the judges shall come the cause of both parties, and he, whom the judges may condemn, shall pay double unto his neighbor.

9. If a man deliver unto his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a lamb, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:

10. Then shall an oath of the Lord be between them both, that he have not stretched out his hand against his neighbor’s goods; and the owner of it shall accept this, and he shall not make it good.

11. But if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.

12. If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it as evidence; that which was torn he shall not make good.

13. And if a man borrow aught of his neighbor, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof not being with it, he shall surely make it good.

14. But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good; if it be a hired thing, the loss is included in its hire.

15. And if a man seduce a virgin that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.

16. If her father refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.

17. Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

18. Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.

19. He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the Lord only, shall be utterly destroyed.

20. And a stranger thou shalt not vex, and shalt not oppress him; for strangers ye were in the land of Egypt.

21. Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.

22. If thou afflict him in any wise; for if he cry at all unto me, I will surely hear his cry:

23. My wrath shall wax hot, and I will slay you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.

24. If thou lend money to my people, to the poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as a lender of money; thou shalt not lay upon him usury.

25. If thou take at all thy neighbor’s raiment in pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him by the time the sun goeth down;

26. For it is his only covering, it is his raiment for his skin; wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.

27. The judges thou shalt not revile; and a ruler among thy people thou shalt not curse.

28. The first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors, shalt thou not delay to offer; the first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.

29. In like manner shalt thou do with thy ox, with thy sheep; seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.

30. And holy men shall ye be unto me: and flesh that is torn of beasts in the field, shall ye not eat; to the dogs shall ye cast it.

## Exodus 23

1. Thou shalt not receive a false report: put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.

2. Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause, to incline after many, to wrest judgment.

3. Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.

4. If thou meet thy enemy’s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.

5. If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to unload him, thou must not do so, but thou shalt surely unload with him.

6. Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.

7. Keep thyself far from a false speech; and him who hath been declared innocent and righteous thou shalt not slay; for I will not justify the wicked.

8. And thou shalt take no bribe; for the bribe blindeth the clear-sighted, and perverteth the words of the righteous.

9. And a stranger shalt thou not oppress; for ye know well the spirit of the stranger, seeing ye yourselves were strangers in the land of Egypt.

10. And six years shalt thou sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof;

11. But the seventh year shalt thou let it rest and lie still; that the needy of thy people may eat of it; and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat: in like manner shalt thou deal with thy vineyard, and with thy olive tree.

12. Six days shalt thou do thy work, and on the seventh day shalt thou rest; that thy ox and thy ass may repose, and the son of thy hand-maid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.

13. And in all things that I have said unto you be on your guard; and of the name of other gods ye shall make no mention, it shall not be heard out of thy mouth.

14. Three times shalt thou keep a feast unto me in the year.

15. The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month of Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty.

16. And the feast of harvest, of the first-fruits of thy labors, which thou hast sown in thy field: and the feast of ingathering, at the conclusion of the year, when thou gatherest in thy labors out of the field.

17. Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord, the Eternal.

18. Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my festive sacrifice remain until morning.

19. The first of the first-fruits of thy land shalt thou bring unto the house of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother’s milk.

20. Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee on the way, and to bring thee unto the place which I have prepared.

21. Beware of him, and obey his voice, disobey him not; for he will not pardon your transgression, because my name is in him.

22. But if thou wilt carefully hearken to his voice, and do all that I shall speak: then will I be an enemy unto thy enemies, and afflict those that afflict thee.

23. For my angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Emorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I will cut them off.

24. Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their deeds; but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and completely break down their statuary images.

25. And ye shall serve the Lord your God, and he will bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will remove sickness from the midst of thee.

26. There shall be no one casting her children, nor a barren woman, in thy land; the number of thy days I will make full.

27. My terror will I send before thee, and will bring in confusion all the people to which thou shalt come; and I will make all thy enemies turn their back unto thee.

28. And I will send hornets before thee, and they shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.

29. I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.

30. Little by little will I drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased and canst possess the land.

31. And I will set thy bounds from the Red Sea unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river; for I will deliver into your hand the inhabitants of the land, and thou shalt drive them out before thee.

32. Thou shalt not make a covenant with them, nor with their gods.

33. They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they cause thee to sin against me; for thou mightest be led to serve their gods, and this would surely be a snare unto thee.

## Exodus 24

1. And unto Moses he said, Come up unto the Lord, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and ye shall bow yourselves down afar off.

2. And Moses alone shall come near unto the Lord, but they shall not come nigh; and the people shall not go up with him.

3. And Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord, and all the laws of justice; and all the people answered with one voice, and said, all the words which the Lord hath spoken will we do.

4. And Moses wrote down all the words of the Lord, and he rose up early in the morning, and built an altar at the foot of the mount, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.

5. And he then sent the young men of the children of Israel, and they offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings unto the Lord, of oxen.

6. And Moses took the half of the blood, and put it in basins; and the other half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

7. And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the hearing of the people; and they said, all that the Lord hath spoken will we do and obey.

8. And Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the Lord hath made with you concerning all these words.

9. Then went up Moses, with Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel.

10. And they saw the God of Israel; and the place under his feet was like a paved work of brilliant sapphire, and like the color of heaven in clearness.

11. And against the nobles of the children of Israel he stretched not forth his hand; and they saw the glory of God, and did eat and drink.

12. And the Lord said unto Moses, come up to me to the mount, and remain there: and I will give thee the tables of stone, with the law, and the commandment which I have written, to teach them.

13. And Moses rose up, and his servant Joshua; and Moses went up to the mount of God.

14. And unto the elders he said, Tarry ye for us here, until the time we come again unto you; and, behold, Aaron and Chur are with you, whoever may have any cause to be decided, let him come unto them.

15. And Moses went up to the mount, and the cloud covered the mount.

16. And the glory of the Lord abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days; and he called unto Moses on the seventh day out of the midst of the cloud.

17. And the appearance of the glory of the Lord was like a devouring fire on the top of the mount, before the eyes of the children of Israel.

18. And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and ascended the mount; and Moses was on the mount forty days and forty nights.

## Exodus 25

1. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,

2. Speak unto the children of Israel, that they may bring me an offering; from every man whose heart prompteth him thereto shall ye take my offering.

3. And this is the offering which ye shall take from them: gold, and silver, and copper,

4. And blue, and purple, and scarlet yarn, and linen thread, and goats’ hair,

20. And the cherubim shall be spreading forth their wings on high, overshadowing the cover with their wings, with their faces turned one to the other; toward the cover shall the faces of the cherubim be directed.

21. And thou shalt put the cover above upon the ark; and in the ark shalt thou put the testimony which I will give unto thee.

22. And I will meet with thee there, and I will speak with thee from above the cover, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, all that which I will command thee unto the children of Israel.

23. Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood; two cubits shall be its length, and a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height.

21. And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle them upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, together with his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.

22. And thou shalt take from the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the midriff above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration;

23. And one loaf of bread, and one cake of the oiled bread, and one wafer, out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the Lord.

24. And thou shalt put all this upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons; and thou shalt make with them a waving before the Lord.

25. And thou shalt then take them from their hands, and burn them upon the altar upon the burnt-offering; for a sweet savor before the Lord, it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord.

26. And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of the consecration that belongeth to Aaron, and make therewith a waving before the Lord; and it shall belong to thee as thy portion.

27. And thou shalt sanctify the breast which hath been waved, and the shoulder which hath been lifted up, which was waved, and which was heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, of that which belongeth to Aaron, and of that which belongeth to his sons:

28. That they shall belong to Aaron and to his sons, as a statute forever, from the children of Israel; for it is a heave-offering; and a heave-offering it shall remain from the children of Israel, from the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, as their heave-offering unto the Lord.

29. And the holy garments belonging to Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to anoint them therein, and to consecrate them therein.

30. Seven days shall that one of his sons put them on who is to be priest in his place, who is to go into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the sanctuary.

31. And the ram of the consecration shalt thou take, and seethe his flesh in a holy place.

32. And Aaron with his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

33. And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate them and to sanctify them; but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy.

34. And if aught of the flesh of the consecration sacrifice, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then shalt thou burn the remainder with fire; it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.

35. And thou shalt do unto Aaron, and to his sons thus, all as I have commanded thee; seven days shalt thou consecrate them.

36. And a bullock shalt thou offer every day for a sin-offering as an atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, in as much as thou makest an atonement upon it; and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.

37. Seven days shalt thou make an atonement upon the altar and sanctify it; and the altar shall be most holy; whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.

38. And this is what thou shalt offer upon the altar: Two sheep of the first year for every day, continually.

39. The one sheep shalt thou offer in the morning; and the other sheep shalt thou offer toward evening.

40. And a tenth part of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil, and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink-offering, shall be for the one sheep.

41. And the other sheep shalt thou offer toward evening; according to the meat-offering of the morning, and according to its drink-offering shalt thou do unto it, for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto the Lord.

42. A continual burnt-offering throughout your generations shall this be at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord; where I will meet with you, to speak unto thee there.

43. And I will meet there with the children of Israel, and it shall be sanctified by my glory.

44. And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: and both Aaron and his sons will I sanctify, that they may he priests unto me.

45. And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and I will be to them for a God.

46. And they shall know that I am the Eternal, their God, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them: I am the Lord their God.

## Exodus 30

1. And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon, of shittim wood shalt thou make it.

2. A cubit shall be its length, and a cubit its breadth, foursquare shall it be; and two cubits shall be its height; from itself shall its horns be.

3. And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, its top, and its sides round about, and its horns; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.

4. And two rings of gold shalt thou make for it beneath its crown, on its two corners shalt thou make them, upon both its sides; and they shall be as receptacles for the staves to bear it by means of them.

5. And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.

6. And thou shalt put it before the vail that is before the ark of the testimony, before the mercy-seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.

7. And Aaron shall burn thereon incense of spices; every morning when he dresseth the lamps, shall he burn it.

8. And when Aaron lighteth the lamps toward evening, shall he burn it; a perpetual incense before the Lord, throughout your generations.

9. Ye shall not offer thereon any strange incense, or burnt-sacrifice, or meat-offering; and a drink-offering shall ye not pour thereon.

10. And Aaron shall make an atonement upon its horns once in a year; with the blood of the sin-offering of the day of atonement, once in the year, shall he make atonement upon it, throughout your generations; it is most holy unto the Lord.

11. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,

12. When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel of those who are to be numbered of them, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the Lord, when they number them; that there be no plague among them, when they number them.

13. This shall they give, every one that passeth among those that are numbered, Half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary; twenty gerahs to the shekel; the half of the shekel shall be the tribute to the Lord.

14. Every one that passeth among those that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give the tribute unto the Lord.

15. The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than the half of a shekel, as a tribute unto the Lord, to make an atonement for your souls.

16. And thou shalt take the money of the atonement from the children of Israel, and shalt employ it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and it shall be unto the children of Israel as a memorial before the Lord, to make an atonement for your souls.

17. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,

18. Thou shalt also make a laver of copper, with its foot of copper, to wash withal: and thou shalt set it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put therein water.

19. And Aaron and his sons shall wash out of it their hands and their feet.

20. When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, shall they wash themselves with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire unto the Lord.

21. And they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not; and it shall be to them a statute for ever, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.

22. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,

23. And thou, take unto thyself principal spices: of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon, its half shall be two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,

24. And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive-oil one hin.

25. And thou shalt make of it an oil of holy anointing, a mixture, compounded after the art of the apothecary: an oil of holy anointing shall it be.

26. And thou shalt anoint therewith the tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony,

27. And the table and all its vessels, and the candlestick and its vessels, and the altar of incense,

28. And the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its foot.

29. And thou shalt sanctify them, and they shall be most holy; whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.

30. And Aaron and his sons shalt thou anoint, and consecrate them to be priests unto me.

31. And unto the children of Israel shalt thou speak, saying, An oil of holy anointing shall this be unto me throughout your generations.

32. Upon the flesh of man shall it not be poured, and after its proportion shall ye not make any thing like it; it is holy, and holy shall it be unto you.

33. Whosoever compoundeth the like of it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall be cut off from his people.

34. And the Lord said unto Moses, Take unto thee spices, balm, and onycha, and galbanum, spices, with pure frankincense: of each shall there be an equal weight.

35. And thou shalt make it an incense, a mixture after the art of the apothecary, well mingled together, pure and holy.

36. And thou shalt pour some of it fine, and offer of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee; most holy shall it be unto you.

37. And as for the incense which thou shalt make, according to its proportion, shall ye not make any unto yourselves: holy shall it be unto thee for the Lord.

38. Whosoever shall make the like of it, to smell thereon, shall be cut off from his people.

## Exodus 31

1. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,

2. See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Chur, of the tribe of Judah:

3. And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,

4. To devise works of art, to work in gold, and in silver, and in copper,

5. And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in the carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship.

6. And behold, I have also given with him Aholiab, the son of Achissamach, of the tribe of Dan, and in the heart of all that are wise-hearted have l put wisdom; and they shall make all that I have commanded thee;

7. The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the cover that is thereupon, and all the vessels of the tabernacle;

8. And the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick with all its vessels, and the altar of incense;

9. And the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its foot;

10. And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister therein;

11. And the anointing oil, and the incense of spices for the holy place: all as I have commanded thee shall they do.

12. And the Lord said unto Moses as followeth,

13. And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Above all, my sabbaths shall ye keep; for a sign it is between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord who doth sanctify you.

14. And ye shall keep the sabbath, for it is holy unto you; every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death; for whosoever doeth any work thereon, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

15. Six days may work be done; but on the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord: whosoever doeth any work on the sabbath-day, shall surely be put to death.

16. And the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.

17. Between me and the children of Israel it shall be a sign for ever; for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed:

18. And he gave unto Moses, when he had finished speaking with him upon mount Sinai, the two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, inscribed with the finger of God.

## Exodus 32

1. And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, the people assembled themselves together around Aaron, and they said unto him, Up, make us gods, that shall go before us; for of this man Moses, who hath brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.

2. And Aaron said unto them, Take out the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.

3. And all the people took out the golden earrings, which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.

4. And he took them from their hand, and fashioned it in a mould, and he made of it a molten calf; and they said, These are thy gods, O Israel, that have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

5. And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron called out, and said, A feast unto the Lord is tomorrow.

6. And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt-offerings, and brought near peace-offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.

7. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, hath become corrupt:

8. They have turned aside quickly from the way which I have commanded them; they have made themselves a molten calf: and they have bowed themselves to it, and have sacrificed unto it, and have said, These are thy gods, O Israel, that have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

9. And the Lord said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people.

10. And now let me alone, and my wrath shall wax hot against them, and I will make an end of them; and I will make of thee a great nation.

11. Thereupon Moses besought the Lord his God, and said, Why, O Lord, shall thy wrath wax hot against thy people, that thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt, with great power and with a mighty hand?

12. Wherefore should the Egyptians say thus, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to destroy them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent thee of the evil decreed against thy people.

13. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou didst swear by thy own self, and speak unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven; and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.

14. And the Lord bethought himself of the evil which he had spoken to do unto his people.

15. And Moses turned about, and went down from the mount with the two tables of the testimony in his hand: tables inscribed on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they inscribed.

16. And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved upon the tables.

17. And Joshua heard the noise of the people in its shouting, and he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.

18. And he said, It is not the voice of a shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of a cry for defeat; the noise of singing do I hear.

19. And it came to pass, when he came nigh unto the camp, and he saw the calf, and the dancing: that the anger of Moses waxed hot, and he cast from his hands the tables, and broke them at the foot of the mount.

20. And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in fire, and ground it to a powder, and he strewed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.

21. And Moses said unto Aaron, What hath this people done unto thee, that thou hast brought upon it so great a sin?

22. And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my Lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that it is bent on mischief.

23. And they said unto me, Make us gods that shall go before us; for of this man Moses, who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what hath become of him.

24. And I said unto them, Who hath any gold? They took it off themselves and gave it to me, and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.

25. And Moses saw the people that it had become unruly; for Aaron had made it unruly for a disgrace among their opponents.

26. Moses then placed himself in the gate of the camp, and said, Whoever is on the Lord’s side, let him come unto me! and there assembled themselves unto him all the sons of Levi.

27. And he said unto them, Thus hath said the Eternal, the God of Israel, Put ye every man his sword by his side, and go ye hither and thither, from gate to gate in the camp, and slay ye every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his relative.

28. And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people on that day about three thousand men.

29. And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord, yea even every man on his son, and on his brother; and to bestow upon you this day a blessing.

30. And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the Lord; peradventure I may obtain an atonement for your sin.

31. And Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Oh, this people hath sinned a great sin, and they have made themselves gods of gold.

32. Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin—; but if not, blot me out, I pray thee, from thy book which thou hast written.

33. And the Lord said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out from my book.

34. And now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee; behold, my angel shall go before thee; but on the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.

35. And the Lord sent a plague among the people, because that they had made the calf which Aaron made.

## Exodus 33

1. And the Lord said unto Moses, Depart, go up from here, thou and the people that thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I swore unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it; —

2. And I will send before thee an angel; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Emorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; —

3. Unto a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in the midst of thee, because thou art a stiffnecked people; lest I consume thee on the way.

4. And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned; and no man did put his ornaments on him.

5. For the Lord had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people; should I go up one moment in the midst of thee, I would consume thee; now therefore put off thy ornaments from thee, and I shall know what I will do unto thee.

6. The children of Israel then stripped themselves of their ornaments they wore from the time they were at mount Horeb.

7. And Moses took the tent, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it, Tabernacle of the congregation; and it came to pass, that every one who sought instruction of the Lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.

8. And it came to pass, that when Moses went out unto the tent, all the people would rise up, and stand every man at the door of his tent, and look after Moses, until he was gone into the tent.

9. And it came to pass, that as Moses entered into the tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the tent, and spoke with Moses.

10. And when all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the tent: then all the people rose up and prostrated themselves, every man at the door of his tent.

11. And the Lord spoke unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend; and then he returned into the camp; but his servant, Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tent.

12. And Moses said unto the Lord, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people; but thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me: and yet thou hast said, I have chosen thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my eyes.

13. Now, therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy eyes, do make me know thy way, that I may know thee, in order that I may find grace in thy eyes; and consider that this nation is thy people.

14. And he said, My presence shall go in advance, and I will give thee rest.

15. And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with us, carry us not up from here.

16. For wherein shall it be known in any wise that I have found grace in thy eyes, I with thy people? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be distinguished, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.

17. And the Lord said unto Moses, Also this thing that thou hast spoken will I do; for thou hast found grace in my eyes, and I have chosen thee by name.

18. And he said, Let me see, I beseech thee, thy glory.

19. And he said, I will cause all my goodness to pass before thy face, and I will proclaim, by name, the Lord before thee; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy.

20. And he said, Thou canst not see my face; for no man can see me, and live.

21. And the Lord said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock:

22. And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in the cleft of the rock, and I will cover thee with my hand, until I have passed by.

23. And then I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back parts; but my face shall not be seen.

## Exodus 34

1. And the Lord said unto Moses, Hew thyself two tables of stone like unto the first; and I will write upon these tables the words which were on the first tables, which thou didst break.

2. And be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount.

3. And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks or herds feed near this mount.

4. And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the Lord had commanded him; and he took in his hand the two tables of stone.

5. And the Lord descended in a cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed, by name, the Lord.

6. And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord is the immutable, eternal Being, the omnipotent God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering and abundant in beneficence and truth;

7. Keeping mercy unto the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.

8. And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and prostrated himself.

9. And he said, If now I have found grace in thy eyes, O Lord, let the Lord, I pray thee, go among us; even because it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon thou our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thy heritage.

10. And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people will I perform wonders, such as have not been done on all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people amongst whom thou art shall see the work of the Lord; for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.

11. Observe thou that which I command thee this day; behold, I will drive out before thee the Emorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

12. Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land against which thou goest up, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee;

13. But their altars shall ye destroy, and their statues shall ye break, and their groves shall ye cut down.

14. For thou shalt worship no other God; for the Lord whose name is Watchful, is a watchful God.

15. Make thou then no covenant with the inhabitants of the land; lest that, if they go astray after their gods, and sacrifice unto their gods, any one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;

16. And lest thou take of his daughters unto thy sons; and when his daughters go astray after their gods, they make thy sons also go astray after their gods.

17. Thou shalt not make unto thyself any molten gods.

18. The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, as I have commanded thee, in the time of the month of Abib; for in the month of Abib thou wentest forth out of Egypt.

19. All that openeth the womb is mine; and every firstling that is a male among thy cattle, whether ox or lamb.

20. But the firstling of an ass shalt thou redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck; all the first-born of thy sons shalt thou redeem; and none shall appear before me empty.

21. Six days thou mayest work, but on the seventh day shalt thou rest: even in ploughing time and in harvest shalt thou rest.

22. And the feast of weeks shalt thou observe, with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest; and the feast of ingathering at the closing of the year.

23. Thrice in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord, the Eternal, the God of Israel.

24. For I will cast out nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders; yet shall no man desire thy land, when thou goest up to appear in the presence of the Lord thy God thrice in the year.

25. Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall be left unto the morning the sacrifice of the feast of the passover.

26. The first of the first-fruits of thy land shalt thou bring unto the house of the Lord thy God: thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother’s milk.

27. And the Lord said unto Moses, Write thee down these words; for after the tenor of these words have I made with thee a covenant and with Israel.

28. And he remained there with the Lord forty days and forty nights; bread he did not eat, and water he did not drink; and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.

29. And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai, with the two tables of the testimony in Moses’ hand, when be came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone, because he had spoken with him.

30. And Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, and, behold, the skin of his face shone: and they were afraid to come nigh unto him.

31. But Moses called unto them, and then returned unto him Aaron and all the princes of the congregation: and Moses spoke to them.

32. And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he commanded them all that which the Lord had spoken with him on mount Sinai.

33. And when Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail over his face.

34. But when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out; and then he came out, and spoke unto the children of Israel that which he had been commanded.

35. And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses’ face shone: and Moses put the vail again over his face, until he went in to speak with him.

## Exodus 35

1. And Moses gathered together all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said unto them, These are the things which the Lord hath commanded, that ye should do them.

2. Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of rest to the Lord: whosoever doth work thereon shall be put to death.

3. Ye shall not kindle any fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.

4. And Moses said unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, as followeth, This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, saying,

5. Take ye from among you an offering unto the Lord; whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the Lord: Gold, and silver, and copper,

6. And blue, and purple, and scarlet yarn, and linen thread, and goats’ hair,

7. And rams’ skills dyed red, and badgers’ skins, and shittim wood,

8. And oil for the lighting, and spices, for the anointing oil, and for the incense of spices,

9. And onyx stones, and stones for setting, for the ephod, and for the breastplate.

10. And all the wise-hearted among you shall come, and make all that which the Lord hath commanded:

11. The tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its hooks, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;

12. The ark, and its staves, with the mercy-seat, and the vail of the separation;

13. The table, and its staves, and all its vessels, and the showbread;

14. And the candlestick for the lighting, and its vessel, and its lamps, with the oil for the lighting;

15. And the altar of incense, and its staves, and the anointing oil, and the incense of spices, and the hanging for the door at the entrance of the tabernacle;

16. The altar of burnt-offering, with its grating of copper, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its foot;

17. The hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court;

18. The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords;

19. The cloths of service, to do service therewith in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in as priests.

20. And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.

21. And they came, every man whose heart stirred him up; and every one whom his spirit made willing, brought the Lord’s offering for the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all its service, and for the holy garments.

22. And they came, the men with the women; whoever was willing-hearted, brought bracelets, and earrings, and finger-rings, and tablets, all kinds of ornaments of gold, and every man that offered an offering of gold unto the Lord.

23. And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet yarn, and linen thread, and goats’ hair, and rams’ skins dyed red, and badgers’ skins, brought them.

24. Every one that did offer an offering of silver and copper brought it as the Lord’s offering; and every one with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it.

25. And all the women that were wise-hearted spun with their hands, and they brought that which they had spun, of the blue, and of the purple, and of the scarlet yarn, and of the linen thread.

26. And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats’ hair.

27. And the princes brought the onyx stones, and the stones for setting, for the ephod, and for the breastplate;

28. And the spice and the oil, for lighting, and for the anointing oil, and for the incense of spices.

29. Every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the Lord had commanded to be made, by the hand of Moses, even that brought the children of Israel as a free-will offering unto the Lord.

30. And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the Lord hath called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Chur, of the tribe of Judah;

31. And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;

32. And to devise works of art, to work in gold, and in silver, and in copper,

33. And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in the carving of wood, to make any manner of work of art.

34. And to teach hath he put in his heart, both to him, and to Aholiab, the son of Achissamach, of the tribe of Dan.

35. He hath filled them with wisdom of heart, to execute all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the designing weaver, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet yarn, and in linen thread, and of the weaver, of those that do every species of work, and of those that devise works of art.

## Exodus 36

1. And Bezalel and Aholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whom the Lord hath put wisdom and understanding to know how to do every manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, shall make all, just as the Lord hath commanded.

2. And Moses called for Bezalel and Aholiab, and every wise-hearted man in whose heart the Lord had put wisdom, every one whose heart stirred him up to come near unto the work to do it:

3. And they received from Moses the whole of the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it; and these brought unto him yet more free-will offerings morning after morning.

4. And then came all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, every man from his own work which they were doing.

5. And they said unto Moses, thus, The people bring more than is required for the service of the work, which the Lord hath commanded to make.

6. And Moses gave the command, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman do any more work for the offering of the sanctuary: so the people were restrained from bringing more.

7. And the stuff prepared was sufficient for all the work to make it, and there was some over.

8. And all the wise-hearted men, among those who wrought the work, made the tabernacle of ten curtains; of twisted linen thread, and blue, and purple, and scarlet yarn; with cherubim, of weaver’s work, made he them.

9. The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits: there was one measure for all the curtains.

10. And he coupled together five of the curtains one to another: and the other five curtains he coupled one to another.

11. And he made loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain, which was the outside in the coupling: the like he made on the border of the curtain, which was the outmost on the second coupling.

12. Fifty loops made he on the one curtain, and fifty loops made he on the edge of the curtain which was in the second coupling: the loops were fixed opposite to each other.

13. And he made fifty hooks of gold; and he coupled the curtains together one unto the other with the hooks, and the tabernacle became thus one piece.

14. And he made curtains of goats’ hair for a tent over the tabernacle; eleven curtains made he the same.

15. The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of each curtain: there was one measure for the eleven curtains.

16. And he coupled five of the curtains by themselves, and six of the curtains by themselves.

17. And he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was the outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops made he on the edge of the curtain of the second coupling.

18. And he made fifty hooks of copper, to couple the tent together that it might be one piece.

19. And he made a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers’ skins above.

20. And he made the boards for the tabernacle, of shittim wood, standing up.

21. Ten cubits was the length of each board, and one cubit and a half was the breadth of each one board.

22. There were two tenons for every board, fitted in, one against the other: the like made he for all the boards of the tabernacle.

23. And he made the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side, on the right.

24. And forty sockets of silver made he under the twenty boards; two sockets under the one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under the other board for its two tenons.

25. And for the other side of the tabernacle, for the north side, he made twenty boards:

26. And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under the one board, and two sockets under the other board.

27. And for the back wall of the tabernacle, westward, he made six boards.

28. And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the back wall.

29. And they were closely fitting beneath, and they were closely joined together on the top, by means of one ring; thus he did to both of them, for both the corners.

30. And so there were eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets, two sockets under every board.

31. And he made bars of shittim wood; five, for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle;

32. And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the back wall, westward.

33. And he made the middle bar to pass through the midst of the boards from the one end to the other end.

34. And the boards he overlaid with gold, and their rings he made of gold, as receptacles for the bars, and he overlaid the bars with gold.

35. And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet yarn, and twisted linen; of weaver’s work made he it, with cherubim.

36. And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, their hooks also were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver.

37. And he made a hanging for the door of the tabernacle, of blue, and purple, and scarlet yarn, and twisted linen; the work of the embroiderer;

38. And its five pillars with their hooks: and he overlaid their tops and made their fillets with gold; and their five sockets were of copper.

## Exodus 37

1. And Bezalel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half was its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height.

2. And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made for it a crown of gold round about.

3. And he cast for it four rings of gold, for the four corners thereof; even two rings on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.

4. And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.

5. And he put the staves into the rings upon the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.

6. And he made a cover of pure gold: two cubits and a half was its length, and one cubit and a half its breadth.

7. And he made two cherubim of gold, of beaten work made he them, on the two ends of the cover;

8. One cherub was on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end; out of the cover itself made he the cherubim on the two ends thereof.

9. And the cherubim were spreading forth their wings on high, overshadowing with their wings the cover, with their faces one to the other; toward the cover were the faces of the cherubim directed.

10. And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was its length, and a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height;

11. And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereto a crown of gold round about.

12. And he made unto it a rim of a hand’s breadth round about, and made a golden crown on its rim round about.

13. And he cast for it four rings of gold, and he put the rings on the four corners, that were on the four feet thereof.

14. Close under the rim were the rings, as receptacles for the staves to bear the table.

15. And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table.

16. And he made the vessels which were upon the table, its dishes, and its spoons, and its purifying tubes, and the supporters wherewith the bread was covered, of pure gold.

17. And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick, its shaft, and its branches, its bowls, its knobs, and its flowers, were out of one piece with it.

18. And six branches were coming out of its sides; three branches of the candlestick out of its one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof.

19. Three bowls, almond-shaped, were on one branch, with a knob and a flower; and three bowls, almond-shaped, were on the other branch, with a knob and a flower; so on the six branches that were coming out of the candlestick.

20. And on the candlestick itself were four bowls, almond-shaped, with its knobs, and its flowers:

21. And a knob was under two branches that came out of the same, and a knob under two branches that came out of the same, and a knob under two branches that came out of the same, for the six branches that proceeded out of it.

22. Their knobs and their branches were out of one piece with it; all of it was one piece of beaten work, of pure gold.

23. And he made its seven lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuff-dishes, of pure gold.

24. Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all its vessels.

25. And he made the altar of incense of shittim wood: its length was a cubit, and its breadth a cubit; it was foursquare, and two cubits was its height; from itself were its horns.

26. And he overlaid it with pure gold, its top, and its sides round about, and its horns: and he made unto it a crown of gold round about.

27. And two rings of gold he made for it beneath its crown, on its two corners, upon both its sides, as receptacles for the staves to bear it by means of them.

28. And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.

29. And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of spices, according to the work of the apothecary.

## Exodus 38

1. And he made the altar of burnt-offering of shittim wood: five cubits was its length, and five cubits its breadth; it was foursquare, and three cubits was its height.

2. And he made its horns on its four corners, from itself were its horns; and he overlaid it with copper.

3. And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basins, and the forks, and the fire-pans: all its vessels made he of copper.

4. And he made for the altar a grating, a network of copper, under its compass beneath, even unto the half of it.

5. And he cast four rings on the four corners of the grating of copper, as receptacles for the staves.

6. And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with copper.

7. And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear it by means of them; hollow, of boards, made he it.

8. And he made the laver of copper, and its foot of copper, of the mirrors of the assembled women who had assembled in troops at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

9. And he made the court: on the south side, on the right, the hangings of the court were of twisted linen, of one hundred cubits;

10. Their pillars were twenty, with their twenty sockets of copper; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.

11. And for the north side one hundred cubits; their pillars were twenty, with their twenty sockets of copper; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.

12. And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits; their pillars were ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.

13. And for the front side, eastward, fifty cubits.

14. Hangings of fifteen cubits, were on the one wing: their pillars were three, and their sockets three.

15. And for the other wing, on both sides of the gate of the court, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars were three, and their sockets three.

16. all the hangings of the court round about were of twisted linen.

17. And the sockets for the pillars were of copper; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets, of silver; and the overlaying of their tops was of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver.

18. And the hanging for the gate of the court was the work of the embroiderer, of blue, and purple, and scarlet yarn, and twisted linen; and twenty cubits was the length, and the height, in the breadth, was five cubits, answering to the hangings of the court.

19. And the pillars for the same were four, with their four sockets of copper; their hooks were of silver, and the overlaying of their tops and their fillets, of silver.

20. And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about were of copper.

21. These are the accounts of the articles furnished for the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of the testimony, which were counted, according to the order of Moses, the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron, the priest.

22. And Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Chur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the Lord had commanded Moses.

23. And with him was Aholiab the son of Achissamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a skilful weaver, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet yarn, and in linen thread.

24. All the gold that was applied to the work in all the work of the sanctuary, to wit, the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary.

25. And the silver of those that were numbered of the congregation was one hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and seventy and five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:

26. A bekah for every head, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.

27. And the hundred talents of silver served to cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail: one hundred sockets to the hundred talents, a talent for every socket.

28. And of the thousand seven hundred and seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their tops and filleted them.

29. And the copper of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels.

30. And he made therewith the sockets of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar of copper, and the grating of copper for it, and all the vessels of the altar;

31. And the sockets of the court round about, and the socket of the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.

## Exodus 39

1. And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet yarn, they made the cloths of service, to do the service in the holy place; and they made the holy garments which were for Aaron, as the Lord had commanded Moses.

2. And he made the ephod, of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet yarn, and twisted linen;

3. And they did heat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet yarn, and in the linen, with weaver’s work.

4. They made shoulder-pieces for it, joined on; on both its edges was it thus joined together.

5. And the belt for girding it on, that was upon it, was of the same piece with itself, of the same make: of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet yarn, and twisted linen; as the Lord had commanded Moses.

6. And they wrought the onyx stones enclosed in casings of gold, engraved with the engraving of a signet, after the names of the children of Israel.

7. And he put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, as stones of memorial to the children of Israel; as the Lord had commanded Moses.

8. And he made the breastplate with weaver’s work, like the work of the ephod: of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet yarn, and twisted linen.

9. It was foursquare, double did they make the breastplate: it was a span in length, and a span in breadth, double.

10. And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row, a sardius, a topaz, and an emerald; this was the first row.

11. And the second row, a carbuncle, a sapphire, and a diamond.

12. And the third row, an opal, a turquoise, and an amethyst.

13. And the fourth row, a chrysolite, an onyx, and a jasper: they were fitted in golden casings when they were set in.

14. And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, engraved with the engraving of a signet, every one according to his name, for the twelve tribes.

15. And they made upon the breastplate chains with knots at the ends, of wreathed work, of pure gold.

16. And they made two casings of gold, and two golden rings; and they put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.

17. And they put the two wreathed chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate.

18. And the two ends of the two wreathed chains they fastened on the two casings, and they put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, on the outside thereof.

19. And they made two golden rings, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, on its border, which was on the opposite side of the ephod, inward.

20. And they made two more golden rings, and put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, toward its front part, close by its seam, above the girdle of the ephod.

21. And they fastened the breastplate by its rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might remain on the girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the Lord had commanded Moses.

22. And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, altogether of blue woolen yarn.

23. And there was an opening in the midst of the robe, as the opening of a habergeon, with a binding round about the opening, that it should not be rent.

24. And they made upon the lower hem of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet yarn, twisted.

25. And they made bells of pure gold; and they put the bells between the pomegranates upon the lower hem of the robe, round about, between the pomegranates;

26. A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the lower hem of the robe, to minister therein; as the Lord had commanded Moses.

27. And they made the coats of linen, of woven work, for Aaron and for his sons,

28. And the mitre of linen, and the goodly bonnets of linen, and linen breeches of twisted linen thread.

29. And the girdle of twisted linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet yarn, the work of the embroiderer; as the Lord had commanded Moses.

30. And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like the engrafting of a signet, Holy to the Lord.

31. And they put on it a lace of blue, to place it upon the mitre above; as the Lord had commanded Moses.

32. Thus was finished all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation; and the children of Israel had made it in accordance with all that the Lord had commanded Moses, so had they made it.

33. And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all its vessels, its hooks, its boards, its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets,

34. And the covering of rams’ skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers’ skins, and the vail of the separation:

35. The ark of the testimony, and its staves, and the mercy-seat;

36. The table, and all its vessels, and the showbread;

37. The pure candlestick, with its lamps, the lamps to be set in order thereupon, and all its vessels, and the oil for the lighting,

38. And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the incense of spices, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle;

39. The copper altar, and the grating of copper which belonged to it, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its foot;

40. The hangings of the court, its pillars and its sockets, and the hanging for the court-gate, its cords, and its pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation;

41. The cloths of service to do the service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister therein.

42. All, just as the Lord had commanded Moses, so had the children of Israel done all the work.

43. And Moses did look over all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the Lord had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.

## Exodus 40

1. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,

2. On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

3. And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and separate the ark with the vail.

4. And thou shalt bring in the table, and arrange the order of the showbread upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.

5. And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony; and thou shalt put up the hanging at the door to the tabernacle.

6. And thou shalt set the altar of burnt-offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

7. And thou shalt set the laver between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.

8. And thou shalt set up the court round about, and put up the hanging at the gate of the court.

9. And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein; and thou shalt hallow it, with all its vessels, and it shall be holy.

10. And thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt-offering, and all its vessels; and thou shalt sanctify the altar, and the altar shall be most holy.

11. And thou shalt anoint the laver with its foot, and sanctify it.

12. And thou shalt bring near Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.

13. And thou shalt clothe Aaron with the holy garments; and thou shalt anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may be a priest unto me.

14. And his sons shalt thou bring near, and clothe them with coats:

15. And thou shalt anoint them, as thou hast anointed their father, that they may be priests unto me; and this shall be, that their anointing shall be unto them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.

16. And Moses did so; all, just as the Lord had commanded him, so did he.

17. And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.

18. And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and placed its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and reared up its pillars.

19. And he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent over it above; as the Lord had commanded Moses.

20. And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and placed the staves on the ark; and he put the mercy-seat upon the ark above.

21. And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the separation, and made therewith a separation for the ark of the testimony; as the Lord had commanded Moses.

22. And he put the table in the tabernacle of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle, northward, without the vail.

23. And he arranged upon it the order of bread before the Lord; as the Lord had commanded Moses.

24. And he placed the candlestick in the tabernacle of the congregation, opposite the table, on the side of the tabernacle, southward.

25. And he lighted the lamps before the Lord; as the Lord had commanded Moses.

26. And he placed the golden altar in the tabernacle of the congregation before the vail.

27. And he burnt thereon the incense of spices; as the Lord had commanded Moses.

28. And he put up the hanging at the door to the tabernacle.

29. And the altar of burnt-offering he placed by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation; and he offered upon it the burnt-offering and the meat-offering; as the Lord had commanded Moses.

30. And he set the laver between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, for washing.

31. And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed therefrom their hands and their feet.

32. When they went in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed themselves; as the Lord had commanded Moses.

33. And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and put up the hanging of the gate of the court; and so did Moses finish the work.

34. And the cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.

35. And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation; because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.

36. And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel were wont to go onward in all their journeyings.

37. But if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that is was taken up.

38. For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and a fire was by night on it, before the eyes of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeyings.
