# Isaiah

## Isaiah 1

1. The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of ‘Uzziyahu, Jotham, Achaz, and Hezekiah, the kings of Judah.

2. Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth; for the Lord hath spoken: Children have I nourished and brought up, but they have rebelled against me.

3. The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.

4. Woe! sinful nation, people laden with iniquity, seed of evil-doers, children that are corrupt: they have forsaken the Lord, they have incensed the Holy One of Israel, they are departed backward.

5. Why will ye be stricken yet more? that ye increase the revolt? every head is sick, and every heart is faint.

6. From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, nor bound up, nor mollified with oil.

7. Your country is desolate, your cities are burnt with fire; your soil—in your presence, strangers devour it, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.

8. And left is the daughter of Zion as a hut in a vineyard, as a lodge in a cucumber field, as a besieged city.

9. Unless the Lord of hosts had left unto us a remnant ever so small, like Sodom should we have been, unto Gomorrah should we have been compared.

10. Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom: give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.

11. For what serveth me the multitude of your sacrifices? saith the Lord: I am sated with the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fatted beasts; and the blood of bullocks, and of sheep, and of he-goats, I do not desire.

12. When ye come to appear in my presence—who hath required this at your hand, to tread down my courts?

13. Continue no more to bring an oblation of deceit; incense of abomination is it unto me: new moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies—I cannot bear misdeed with festive gathering.

14. Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth; they are become a burden unto me; I am weary to bear them,

15. And when ye spread forth your hands, I will withdraw my eyes from you; yea, when ye make ever so many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.

16. Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your deeds from before my eyes; cease to do evil;

17. Learn to do well; seek for justice, relieve the oppressed, do justice to the fatherless, plead for the widow.

18. Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins should be as scarlet, they shall become white as the snow; though they should be red like crimson, they shall become like wool.

19. If ye be willing and obey, the best of the land shall ye eat;

20. But if ye refuse and rebel, by the sword shall ye be devoured; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.

21. How is she become a harlot, the faithful town! she, that was full of justice; righteousness lodged therein; but now murderers.

22. Thy silver is become dross, thy wine is drugged with water;

23. Thy princes are rebels, and companions of thieves; every one loveth brides, and runneth after rewards; to the fatherless they will not do justice, and the cause of the widow doth not come unto them.

24. Therefore saith the Lord, the Eternal of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will take satisfaction on my adversaries, and be avenged on my enemies.

25. And I will turn my hand against thee, and purge away as with lye thy dross, and remove all thy tin:

26. And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning; after that shalt thou be called, The city of righteousness, the town that is faithful.

27. Zion shall be redeemed through justice, and her converts through righteousness.

28. But destruction shall come over transgressors and sinners together, and those that forsake the Lord shall perish.

29. For people shall be ashamed because of the terebinths which ye had desired, and ye shall be put to the blush because of the gardens that ye had chosen.

30. For ye shall be as a terebinth the leaves of which wither, and as a garden that hath no water.

31. And the mighty oppressor shall become as tow, and his workman as a spark; and they shall both burn together, with none to quench.

## Isaiah 2

1. The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz foresaw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.

2. And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be firmly established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and unto it shall flow all the nations.

3. And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; that he may teach us of his ways, and we may walk in his paths; for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem.

4. And he will judge among the nations, and decide for many people; and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-knives: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, and they shall not learn any more war.

5. O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.

6. For thou hast abandoned thy people, the house of Jacob, because they are full of witchcraft more than the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and with the children of strangers they unite themselves.

7. And full became their land of silver and gold, and there is no end to their treasures; and full became their land of horses, and there is no end to their chariots;

8. And full became their land of idols; to the work of their own hands they bow themselves, to what their own fingers have made.

9. And so is bent down the son of earth, and humbled the man; and thou wilt not forgive them.

10. Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, because of the dread of the Lord, and because of the glory of his majesty.

11. The looks of human pride shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bent down: and exalted shall be the Lord alone on that day.

12. For there is a day of judgment unto the Lord of hosts over every proud and lofty one; and over every exalted one, that he be brought low;

13. And over all the cedars of the Lebanon, the high and exalted, and over all the oaks of Bashan;

14. And over all the high mountains, and over all the exalted hills;

15. And over every high tower, and over every fortified wall;

16. And over all the ships of Tharshish; and over all desirable palaces.

17. And the pride of man shall be bent down, and the haughtiness of men shall be humbled: and exalted shall be the Lord alone on that day.

18. And the idols will he utterly abolish.

19. And men shall enter into the caverns of rocks, and into the rifts of the earth, because of the dread of the Lord, and because of the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to terrify the earth.

20. On that day shall a man cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which have been made for him to worship, to the moles and to the bats;

21. To enter into the clefts of the rocks, and into the hollows of the cliffs, because of the dread of the Lord, and because of the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to terrify the earth.

22. Withdraw yourselves then from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; because, for what is he to be esteemed?

## Isaiah 3

1. For, behold, the Lord, the Eternal of hosts, doth remove from Jerusalem and from Judah stay and staff, every stay of bread, and every stay of water.

2. The hero, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,

3. The captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counsellor, and the skilful artificer, and the eloquent orator.

4. And I will set up boys as their princes, and children shall rule over them.

5. And so shall the people press man against man, and one against the other: the boy shall demean himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honorable.

6. When a man will seize hold on his brother in the house of his father, saying, Thou hast a garment, thou shalt be our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand:

7. He will swear on that day, saying, I will not be a chief; and in my house is neither bread nor clothing; you shall not appoint me a ruler of the people.

8. For Jerusalem is sunk to decay, and Judah is fallen; because their tongue and their doings are against the Lord, to incense the eyes of his glory.

9. The boldness of their face testifieth against them; and like Sodom they tell openly their sin, they conceal it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have prepared evil unto themselves.

10. Say ye to the righteous, that he hath done well; for the fruit of their doings shall they eat.

11. Woe unto the wicked who doeth evil; for the recompense of his hands shall be bestowed on him.

12. My people! their oppressors are children, and women rule over them. O my people! thy leaders cause thee to err, and the direction of thy paths they corrupt.

13. The Lord is stepped forth to plead, and standeth up to judge the people.

14. The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and their princes; but ye—ye have eaten up the vineyard; the plunder of the poor is in your houses.

15. What mean ye that ye crush my people, and grind down the faces of the poor? saith the Lord the Eternal of hosts.

16. And the Lord said, Forasmuch as the daughters of Zion are proud, and walk with stretched forth necks and casting about their eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:

17. Therefore will the Lord smite with leprosy the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will lay open their nakedness.

18. On that day will the Lord take away the beauty of their tinkling shoe-buckles, and the hair-nets, and the crescent-shaped ornaments,

19. The drops, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,

20. The bonnets, and the foot-chains, and the head-bands, and the tablets, and the earrings,

21. The finger-rings, and nose-jewels,

22. The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the shawls, and the pockets.

23. The mirrors, and the chemisettes, and the turbans, and the long vails.

24. And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be corruption; and instead of a girdle a rope; and instead of curled hair baldness; and instead of a wide garment a girding of sackcloth, a mark of burning instead of beauty.

25. Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty ones in the war.

26. And then shall her gates lament and mourn; and stript of all shall she sit upon the ground.

## Isaiah 4

1. And seven women shall take hold of one man on that day, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, take but away our reproach.

2. On that day shall the sprout of the Lord be for ornament and for honor, and the fruit of the land for excellence and for glory for the escaped of Israel.

3. And it shall come to pass, that whoever is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, every one that is written down unto life in Jerusalem:

4. When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have scoured away the blood-guiltiness of Jerusalem from her midst, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of destruction.

5. And then will the Lord create upon every dwelling of mount Zion, and upon her places of assembly, a cloud and smoke by day, and the brightness of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a covering.

6. And a tabernacle shall it be for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge, and for a covert from tempest and from rain.

## Isaiah 5

1. I will sing now for my beloved, the song of my dear one touching his vineyard. A vineyard had my beloved on a rich hill-top;

2. And he fenced it in, and cleared it of stones, and planted it with the choicest vines, and built a tower in its midst, and also a winepress he hewed out therein: and he hoped that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth worthless fruit.

3. And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard.

4. What more was to be done to my vineyard, that I had not done in it? Why then did I hope that it should bring forth grapes, while it brought forth worthless fruit?

5. And now I will let you know also what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be eaten off; I will break down its wall, and it shall be trodden down;

6. And I will lay it quite waste; it shall not be pruned, nor hoed around; and it shall be overgrown with briers and thorns; and the clouds will I command that they send down no rain upon it.

7. For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are the plant of his delight: and he hoped for justice, but behold injustice; for equity, but behold iniquity.

8. Woe unto those that cause house to join on house, bring field near to field, till there is no more room, so that ye may be left alone as the inhabitants in the midst of the land!

9. In my ears spoke the Lord of hosts, Truly many houses shall become desolate, yea, great and beautiful ones without an inhabitant.

10. Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield but one bath, and a chomer-seed shall yield but an ephah.

11. Woe unto those that rise up early in the morning, that they may run after strong drink; that continue until late in the twilight, till wine inflame them!

12. And there are harp and psaltery, tambourine and flute, and wine at their drinking-feasts; but the deeds of the Lord they regard not, and the works of his hands they behold not.

13. Therefore are my people led into exile, for want of knowledge: and their honorable men suffer of famine, and their multitude are panting with thirst.

14. Therefore hath the deep enlarged her desire, and opened her mouth without measure: and there descend Jerusalem’s glory, and her multitude, and her noise, and whoever rejoiced therein.

15. And bent down shall be the son of earth, and humbled shall be the man, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled;

16. And the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and the holy God shall be sanctified by displaying his righteousness.

17. Then shall the sheep feed according to their wont, and the ruins of the fat ones shall sojourners eat.

18. Woe unto those that draw iniquity with the cords of falsehood, and as with a wagon-rope, sinfulness;

19. That say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it: and let draw nigh and come the counsel of the Holy One of Israel, that we may know it!

20. Woe unto those that say of the evil it is good, and of the good it is evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!

21. Woe unto those that are wise in their own eyes, and intelligent in their own esteem!

22. Woe unto those that are heroes to drink wine, and men of might to mingle strong drink;

23. Who justify the wicked in lieu of a bribe, and who deprive the righteous of their right!

24. Therefore as the tongue of the fire devoureth the stubble, and dry hay sinketh before the flame: so shall their root be as rotten things, and their blossom shall fly up as the dust; because they have despised the law of the Lord of hosts, and the word of the Holy One of Israel they have rejected.

25. For this cause is kindled the anger of the Lord against his people, and he stretcheth forth his hand against them, and he smiteth them; and the mountains tremble, and their carcasses lie like sweepings in the midst of the streets: with all this his anger is not turned away, but still is his hand stretched out.

26. And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from afar, and will call for one of them from the end of the earth; and, behold, with speed, swiftly, it cometh;

27. There is none weary, nor stumbling among its men; it slumbereth not, it sleepeth not; not loosened is the girdle of its loins, not broken is the latchet of its shoes;

28. Whose arrows are sharpened, and all whose bows are bent; its horses hoofs are hard like the flint, and its wheels like the whirlwind;

29. It hath a roar like the lioness, it roareth like the young lions: yea, it growleth, and layeth hold of the prey, and carrieth it safely off, with none to deliver.

30. And it will rage against them on that day like with the raging of the sea: and if one look unto the earth, behold, there is darkness, oppression, and the light is darkened through the darkness of its clouds.

## Isaiah 6

1. In the year of king ‘Uzziyahu’s death I saw the Lord sitting upon a high and exalted throne, and his train filled the temple.

2. Seraphim were standing around him, each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two did he fly.

3. And one called unto the other, and said, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.

4. And the posts of the threshold shook at the voice of those that called aloud, and the house was filled with smoke.

5. And I said, Woe is me! for I am lost; because a man of unclean lips am I, and in the midst of a people of unclean lips do I dwell; for the King, the Lord of hosts have my eyes seen.

6. Then flew unto me one of the seraphim, and in his hand was a live coal, with the tongs had he taken it from off the altar:

7. And he touched therewith upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thy iniquity is departed, and thy sin is forgiven.

8. And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? And I said, Here am I: send me.

9. And he said, Go, and say unto this people, Hear indeed, but understand not; and see indeed, but know not.

10. Obdurate will remain the heart of this people, and their ears will be heavy, and their eyes will be shut: so that they will not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor their hearts be understanding, so that they be converted, and healing be granted them.

11. And I said, How long, O Lord? And he said, Until that cities be left waste without an inhabitant, and houses without man, and the soil be made desolate as a wilderness,

12. And the Lord will have removed far away the men, and the depopulation be great in the midst of the land.

13. And should a tenth part thereof yet remain, it will again be swept away: yet like the terebinth and the oak, which, when they cast their leaves, retain their stems, so remaineth the holy seed, its stem.

## Isaiah 7

1. And it came to pass in the days of Achaz the son of Jotham, the son of ‘Uzziyahu, the king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekach the son of Remalyahu, the king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it; but were not able to make an attack upon it.

2. And it was told unto the house of David, saying, Syria is encamped with Ephraim; and his heart trembled, with the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest are shaken before the wind.

3. And the Lord said unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Achaz, thou with Shear-yashub thy son, to the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the highway of the washer’s field;

4. And thou shalt say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, and let thy heart not become faint because of these two stumps of smoking firebrands, before the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remalyahu.

5. Forasmuch as Syria, with Ephraim and the son of Remalyahu, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,

6. Let us go up against Judah, and besiege it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set up as king in the midst of it the son of Tabeal:

7. Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, It shall not succeed, and it shall not come to pass.

8. For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin: and within sixty and five years shall Ephraim be broken, to be no more a people.

9. And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remalyahu’s son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not have permanence.

10. And the Lord continued to speak unto Achaz, saying,

11. Ask thee a sign from the Lord thy God; ask it in the depth, or high up above.

12. But Achaz said, I will not ask, and I will not tempt the Lord.

13. And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that ye will weary also my God?

14. Therefore will the Lord himself give you a sign: behold, this young woman shall conceive, and bear a son, and she shall call his name ‘Immanu-el, God with us.

15. Cream and honey shall he eat, so soon as he knoweth to refuse the evil, and to choose the good.

16. For before yet the child shall know to refuse the evil, and to choose the good, shall be forsaken the land, of the kings of which thou feelest dread.

17. The Lord will bring over thee, and over thy people, and over thy father’s house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim withdrew from Judah,—the king of Assyria.

18. And it shall come to pass on that day, that the Lord will call for the fly that is in the uttermost end of the streams of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.

19. And they shall come, and shall encamp, all of them, in the desolate valleys, and in the clefts of the rocks, and upon all thorn-hedges, and upon all bushes.

20. On the same day will the Lord shave with the razor that is hired, from among those on the other side of the river, with the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and also the beard shall it entirely remove.

21. And it shall come to pass on that day, that a man shall nourish but one young cow, and two sheep;

22. And it shall happen, that for the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat cream; for cream and honey shall eat every one that is left in the midst of the land.

23. And it shall come to pass on that day, that every place, where there are now a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels, shall be,—yea, this shall be given up to briers and thorns.

24. With arrows and with bows shall men enter thither; because all the land shall become covered with briers and thorns.

25. And all mountains that are worked with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: and they shall serve for the pasture of oxen, and for the treading of sheep.

## Isaiah 8

1. And the Lord said unto me, Take thyself a large table, and write on it with distinct letters, Lemaher-shalal-chash-bas.

2. And I was to summon for myself trustworthy witnesses, Uriyah the priest, and Zecharyahu the son of Yeberechyahu.

3. And I came near unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son. Then said the Lord to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-chash-bas.

4. For before yet the boy shall know to call, My father, and my mother, the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be carried away before the king of Assyria.

5. And the Lord continued to speak unto me again, saying,

6. Forasmuch as this people despiseth the waters of Shiloach that flow softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remalyahu’s son:

7. Yea therefore behold, the Lord bringeth up over them the strong and many waters of the river,—the king of Assyria, and all his glory; and he shall come up over all his channels, and step over all his banks;

8. And he shall penetrate into Judah, overflow and flood over, even to the neck shall he reach; and his outstretched wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O ‘Immanu-el.

9. Associate yourselves, O ye people, yet shall ye be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of the far portions of the earth: gird yourselves, yet shall ye be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, yet shall ye be broken in pieces.

10. Take counsel together, yet shall it come to naught; speak the word, and it shall not stand firm; for with us is God.

11. For thus said the Lord to me with the strength of prophecy, and warned me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,

12. Call ye not a conspiracy all that this people may call a conspiracy, and what it feareth shall ye not fear, and be not terrified thereat.

13. The Lord of hosts, him shall ye sanctify; and let him be your fear, and let him be your terror.

14. And he will be for a sanctuary; but also for a stone of stumbling and for a rock to fall over unto both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

15. And many shall stumble over them, and fall, and be broken, and snared, and be caught.

16. Bind up the testimony, seal up the law among my disciples.

17. And I will wait for the Lord, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope for him.

18. Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for signs and for tokens in Israel, from the Lord of hosts who dwelleth on mount Zion.

19. And when they shall say unto you, "Inquire of those that have familiar spirits, and of the wizards, that whisper, and that mutter:" should not a people inquire of their God? should we then in behalf of the living inquire of the dead?

20. Hold to the law and to the testimony: if they are not to speak according to this word, in which there is no light.

21. And the people shall pass through the land, hard oppressed and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they will become enraged, and curse their king and their god, and turn toward on high for aid.

22. And they will look unto the earth; and behold there are trouble and darkness, dimness of oppression, and they shall be scattered into obscurity. For no fatigue befalleth him that oppresseth it; in the first time he made light of the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, and at the last he will deal hard, with the way by the sea, on the other side of the Jordan, up to the Galilee of the nations.

## Isaiah 9

1. The people that walk in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death—a light shineth brightly over them.

2. Thou hast multiplied the nation, made great their joy: they rejoice before thee as with the joy in harvest, as men are glad when they divide the spoil.

3. For the yoke of their burden, and the staff on their shoulder, the rod of their oppressor, hast thou broken, as on the day of Midian.

4. For all the weapons of the fighter in the battle’s tumult, and the garment rolled in blood, shall be burnt, become food for fire.

5. For a child is born unto us, a son hath been given unto us, and the government is placed on his shoulders; and his name is called, Wonderful, counsellor of the mighty God, of the everlasting Father, the prince of peace,

6. For promoting the increase of the government, and for peace without end, upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom, to establish it and to support it through justice and righteousness, from henceforth and unto eternity: the zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.

7. A word hath the Lord sent against Jacob, and it hath alighted upon Israel.

8. And experience it shall all the people together, Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria; because they say, in the pride and haughtiness of heart,

9. "The bricks are fallen down, but with hewn stones will we re-build: the sycamores are cut down, but with cedars will we replace them."

10. Therefore will the Lord strengthen the adversaries of Rezin above him, and will stir up his enemies;

11. The Syrians in front, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with a full mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand still remaineth stretched out.

12. And the people return not unto him that smiteth them, and the Lord of hosts do they not seek.

13. And the Lord cutteth off from Israel head and tail, palm-branch and rush, on one day.

14. The ancient and honorable is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies is the tail.

15. And the guides of this people are those that guide to error; and those that are led of them are misled.

16. Therefore will the Lord have no joy in their young men, and on their fatherless and widows will he have no mercy; for every one is a hypocrite and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaketh scandalous words. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand still remaineth stretched out.

17. For wickedness burneth like the fire; it shall devour the briers and thorns: and it shall kindle a flame in the thickets of the forest, and they shall be shrouded by the wreaths of smoke.

18. Through the fury of the Lord of hosts is the land scorched, and the people have become as food for the fire; no man will spare his brother.

19. And he snatcheth on the right hand, and is yet hungry; and he eateth on the left hand, and are not yet satisfied; they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:

20. Menasseh against Ephraim: and Ephraim against Menasseh; and they together against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand still remaineth stretched out.

## Isaiah 10

1. Woe unto those that decree decrees of unrighteousness, and the writers who write down wrongful things;

2. To turn aside from judgment the needy, and to rob the just due of the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may plunder the fatherless!

3. And what will ye do on the day of the visitation, and at the desolation which will come from afar? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?

4. Without me they shall kneel down under the prisoners, and under the slain shall they fall. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand still remaineth stretched out.

5. Woe over Asshur, the rod of my anger; and a staff is in their hand my indignation.

6. Against a hypocritical nation will I send him, and against the people of my fury will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to carry off the prey, and to render them trodden down like the mire of the streets.

7. But he deemeth it not so, and his heart doth not think so; but to destroy is in his heart, and to cut off nations not a few.

8. For he saith, "Are not my princes altogether kings?

9. Is not Calno like Karkemish? is not Chamath like Arpad? is not Samaria like Damascus?

10. As my hand hath reached the kingdoms of the idols, whose graven images exceeded in number those of Jerusalem and of Samaria:

11. Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, do so unto Jerusalem and unto her idols?"

12. Wherefore shall it come to pass, that when the Lord hath completed all his work on mount Zion and in Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the haughtiness of the king of Asshur, and the vain-glory of his proud looks.

13. For he hath said, "By the strength of my hand have I done it, and by my wisdom, for I have intelligence; and I have removed the boundaries of nations, and their laid-up treasures have I plundered, and brought down low those that were powerfully seated.

14. And my hand hath reached, as a bird’s nest, the wealth of the people: and as one gathereth up eggs that are forsaken, have I myself gathered up all the earth: and there was not one that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or chirped."

15. Shall the axe boast itself over him that heweth therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that swingeth it? as if the rod should swing about those that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up him who is no wood.

16. Therefore will the Lord, the Eternal of hosts, send forth among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory shall be kindled a burning like the burning of a fire.

17. And the light of Israel shall become a fire, and his Holy One a flame; and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers on one day.

18. And the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body, will he destroy: and he shall be as a tree eaten to powder by the worms.

19. And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few in number, so that a boy may write them down.

20. And it shall come to pass on that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall not farther lean for support upon him that smiteth them; but they shall lean upon the Lord, the Holy one of Israel, in truth.

21. The remnant shall return, the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.

22. For though thy people Israel should be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant only of them shall return: destruction is decreed, it overfloweth with righteousness.

23. For it is completed and decreed: the Lord, the Eternal of hosts will do it in the midst of all the land.

24. Therefore thus hath said the Lord the Eternal of hosts, Be not afraid, O my people that dwellest in Zion, of Asshur, who will smite thee with the rod, and lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.

25. For yet but a very little while more, and the indignation shall cease, and my anger shall be for their destruction.

26. And the Lord shall lift up a scourge over him like at the smiting of Midian at the rock of ‘Oreb: and as his staff was lifted over the sea, so will he carry him off after the manner of Egypt.

27. And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be removed from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be broken because of the fatness.

28. He cometh to ‘Ayath, he passeth on to Migron; at Michmash he layeth up his baggage;

29. They go through the pass; they take up their lodging at Geba’; Ramah trembleth; Gib’ah of Saul fleeth.

30. Let thy voice resound, O daughter of Gallim; listen Layshah; O poor ‘Anathoth!

31. Madmenah is in motion; the inhabitants of Gebim are assembled to flee.

32. As yet today will he remain at Nob: then will he swing his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.

33. Behold, the Lord, the Eternal of hosts, will lop off the fruitful bough with terrific might: and those of towering growth shall be hewn down, and the high shall be laid low.

34. And he will cut down the thickets of the forests with iron, and the Lebanon shall fall by means of a mighty one.

## Isaiah 11

1. And there shall come forth a shoot out of the stem of Jesse, and a sprout shall spring out of his roots.

2. And there shall rest upon him the spirit of the Lord, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;

3. And he shall be animated by the fear of the Lord; and not after the sight of his eyes shall he judge, and not after the hearing of his ears shall he decide;

4. But he shall judge with righteousness the poor, and decide with equity for the suffering ones of the earth; and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.

5. And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his hips.

6. And the wolf shall dwell with the sheep, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling shall be together, and a little boy shall lead them.

7. And the cow and the she-bear shall feed, together shall their young ones lie down: and the lion shall like the ox eat straw.

8. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and on the basilisk’s den shall the weaned child stretch out his hand.

9. They shall not do hurt nor destroy on all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.

10. And it shall happen on that day, that he of the root of Jesse, who shall stand as an ensign of the people, to him shall nations come to inquire: and his resting-place shall be glorious.

11. And it shall happen on that day, that the Lord will put forth his hand again the second time to acquire the remnant of his people, which shall remain, from Asshur and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from ‘Elam, and from Shin’ar, and from Chamath, and from the islands of the sea.

12. And he will lift up an ensign unto the nations, and will assemble the outcasts of Israel; and the dispersed of Judah will he collect together from the four corners of the earth.

13. And then shall depart the envy of Ephraim, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not assail Ephraim.

14. But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; together shall they spoil the children of the east: upon Edom and Moab shall they lay their hands; and the children of ‘Ammon shall obey them.

15. And the Lord will destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and swing his hand over the river with his mighty wind, and will smite it into seven streams, and render it passable with shoes.

16. And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people, which shall remain from Asshur, like as it was to Israel on the day that they came up out of the land of Egypt.

## Isaiah 12

1. And thou shalt say on that day, "I will thank thee, O Lord, that thou wast angry with me: thy anger now is turned away, and thou comfortest me.

2. Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust him; for my strength and song is Yah the Eternal: and he is become my salvation."

3. And ye shall draw water with gladness out of the springs of salvation.

4. And ye shall say on that day, "Give thanks unto the Lord, call on his name, make known his deeds among the people, keep it in remembrance that exalted is his name.

5. Sing unto the Lord; for he hath wrought a stupendous thing: known is this on all the earth."

6. Call aloud and shout, inhabitress of Zion; for great is in the midst of thee the Holy One of Israel.

## Isaiah 13

1. The doom of Babylon, which Isaiah Amoz’ son foresaw.

2. Upon a high mountain lift ye up a banner, raise high your voice unto them, wave the hand, that they may enter into the gates of the princes.

3. I have charged my prepared ones, I have also called my heroes for my anger, those that rejoice in my highness.

4. There is a noise of tumult on the mountains, like that of a numerous people; a noise of shouting of kingdoms of nations assembled; the Lord of hosts mustereth a host of battle.

5. They are coming from a far-off country, from the end of the heavens, here is the Lord, with the weapons of his indignation, to destroy all the land.

6. Wail ye; for nigh is the day of the Lord; like wasting from the Almighty shall it come.

7. Therefore all hands shall become weak, and every mortal’s heart shall melt;

8. And they shall be affrighted, pangs and pains shall seize on them; they shall have throes as a woman that travaileth; one at the other shall they look amazed; red like flames shall their faces glow.

9. Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, direful, laden with wrath and the fierceness of anger, to render the earth desolate: and its sinners will he destroy out of it.

10. For the stars of the heavens and their constellations shall not give forth their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not shed abroad her light.

11. And I will visit on the world its evil, and on the wicked their iniquity; and I will stop the arrogance of the presumptuous, and the haughtiness of the tyrants will I humble.

12. I will make the mortal more precious than fine gold; and man, more than the valued metal of Ophir.

13. Therefore will I shake the heavens, and the earth shall start quaking out of her place, at the wrath of the Lord of hosts, and on the day of his fierce anger.

14. And the people shall be as the chased roe, and as flocks which no one gathereth up; every man to his own people shall they turn, and every man into his own land shall they flee.

15. Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword.

16. And their babes shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes: spoiled shall be their houses, and their wives ravished.

17. Behold, I will stir up against them the Medes; who will not regard silver, and who will not delight in gold.

18. And their bows will dash young men to pieces; and on the fruit of the womb will they have no mercy; on children their eye will not look with pity.

19. And thus shall Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the proud ornament of the Chaldeans, become like the overthrow through God of Sodom and Gomorrah.

20. It shall not be inhabited for ever, and it shall not be dwelt in from generation to generation; nor shall the Arabian pitch there his tent; and shepherds shall not let their flocks rest there.

21. But there shall rest the wild beasts of the desert; and their houses shall be full of owls; and ostriches shall dwell there, and evil spirits shall dance there.

22. And jackals shall howl in her palaces, and monsters in the temples of pleasure; and near to come is her time, and her days shall not be extended.

## Isaiah 14

1. For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will again make choice of Israel, and replace them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined unto them, and they shall attach themselves to the house of Jacob.

2. And nations shall take them, and bring them to their own place; but the house of Israel shall obtain possession of them in the land of the Lord for men-servants and for maid-servants; and they shall take captive their captors, and they shall rule over their oppressors.

3. And it shall come to pass on the day when the Lord will give thee rest from thy trouble, and from thy vexation, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve,

4. That thou wilt take up this parable against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath ceased the oppressor! ceased the exactress of gold!

5. Broken hath the Lord the staff of the wicked, the sceptre of rulers;

6. He who smote people in wrath, blows without intermission, he that ruled in anger nations, persecuting without restraint.

7. At rest, quiet is all the earth; men break forth into loud song.

8. Also, the fir-trees rejoice at thee, the cedars of Lebanon, "Since thou wast laid low, no feller is come up against us."

9. The nether world from below is in motion concerning thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the departed for thee, all the chief ones of the earth; it hath caused to rise up from their thrones all the kings of nations.

10. They all will commence and say unto thee, "Thou—thou also art become weak like us; similar unto us art thou become!"

11. Into the nether world is brought down thy pride, the clatter of thy psalteries: beneath thee is spread the worm, and thy cover is the moth.

12. How art thou fallen from heaven, O morning-star, son of the dawn! how art thou hewn down to the ground, crusher of nations!

13. And thou—thou hadst said in thy heart, "Into heaven will I ascend, above the stars of God will I exalt my throne; and I will sit also upon the mount of the assembly, in the farthest end of the north;

14. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be equal to the Most High."

15. But into the nether world shalt thou be brought down, into the lowest depth.

16. They that see thee will gaze at thee, will regard thee well, saying, "Is this the man that caused the earth to tremble, that made kingdoms quake?

17. That rendered the world as a wilderness, and pulled down its cities: never opened the prison-house of his prisoners?"

18. All the kings of nations, all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own eternal house.

19. But thou—thou art cast out of thy grave like a discarded offshoot, as a garment of those that are slain, pierced by the sword, that go down to the stones of the pit, as a carcass trodden under foot.

20. Thou shalt not be united with them in burial; because thy land hast thou destroyed, thy people hast thou slain: to eternity shall not be called the seed of evil-doers.

21. Prepare for his children the slaughter, for the iniquity of their fathers: that they may not rise, and possess the land, and fill the face of the world with enemies of mankind.

22. And I will rise up against them, saith the Lord of hosts; and I will cut off from Babylon name, and remnant, and son, and grandson, saith the Lord.

23. I will also make it a possession for the hedgehog, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the Lord of hosts.

24. Sworn hath the Lord of hosts, saying, Surely as I have purposed, so doth it come to pass; and as I have resolved, so shall it occur:

25. To break Asshur in my own land, and upon my mountains will I tread him under foot; then shall his yoke be removed from off them, and his burden from off their shoulders.

26. This is the resolve that is resolved over all the earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations.

27. For the Lord of hosts hath resolved, and who shall frustrate it? and it is his hand which is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?

28. In the year king Achaz died was this prophecy given.

29. Rejoice not, thou entire Palestine, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken; for out of the serpent’s root shall come forth an adder, and its fruit shall be a flying dragon.

30. And the first-born of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall rest in safety: and I will kill with famine thy root, and men shall slay thy remnant.

31. Wail, O gate; cry out, O city; thou art dissolved, O thou entire Palestine; for from the north a smoke is coming, and there is no one solitary among those that are bidden to come.

32. And what will each one of the messengers of the nation answer? That the Lord hath founded Zion; and that therein shall find protection the poor of his people.

## Isaiah 15

1. The doom of Moab. Truly in a night is ‘Ar of Moab plundered, it is laid waste; truly in a night is Kir of Moab plundered, it is laid waste.

2. It goeth up to the idol- house, and Dibon goeth up to the high-places to weep, on Nebo and on Medeba shall Moab wail: on all its heads there is baldness, and every beard is hewn off.

3. In its streets they are girded with sack-cloth, on its roofs, and in its public places every one shall wail, groan with weeping.

4. And loud crieth Cheshbon with El’aleh; as far as Yahaz is heard their voice: therefore the armed men of Moab shall howl; its soul is grieved for itself.

5. My heart will cry for Moab, whose fugitives are as far as Zo’ar, and the third ‘Eglarth; for the ascent of Luchith—with weeping is it ascended; for on the way to Choronayim they let resound the cry of defeat in battle.

6. For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate; for dry is the grass, gone are the herbs, and green things are no more.

7. Therefore the rest of their acquisitions and what they possess shall they carry away over the brook of the willows.

8. For the cry hath encompassed the boundary of Moab; up to Eglayim is heard its wail, and at Beer-elim is heard its wail.

9. For the waters of Dimon are filled with blood; for I will bring over Dimon armed bands; over the escaped of Moab cometh a lion, and over the remnant of the land.

## Isaiah 16

1. Send ye the lambs of the ruler of the land from Sela’, through the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.

2. For it shall be, that, as a fugitive bird, as a chased nest, so shall be the daughters of Moab at the fords of Arnon.

3. Bring counsel, execute justice; render like the night thy shadow in the midst of the noonday; conceal the outcasts; betray not the fugitive.

4. Let my outcasts sojourn with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the waster: till ceaseth the extortion, past be the wasting, and vanished be the oppressor out of the land.

5. And there shall be founded through kindness a throne; and there shall sit upon it in truthfulness in the tent of David a judge who seeketh justice, and is quick in righteousness.

6. We have heard of the pride of Moab; that he is very proud: of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath, his groundless lies.

7. Therefore shall Moab wail for Moab, every one shall wail; for the strong walls of Kir-charesseth shall ye lament, deeply stricken.

8. For the fields of Cheshbon are withered, the vine of Sibmah —the lords of nations have beaten down its branches, they did reach as far as Ya’zer, into the wilderness did they wander; its tendrils were stretched forth, they passed over the sea.

9. Therefore will I weep, when weeping for Ya’zer, for the vine of Sibmah: I will moisten thee richly with my tears, O Cheshbon, and El’aleh; for over the gathering of thy summer fruits and over thy harvest the battle-cry is fallen.

10. And thus are taken away joy and gladness out of the fruitful field; and in the vineyards shall be no singing, shall be no joyful shout: in the presses shall the treader not tread out wine; I have stopped the harvest-call.

11. Therefore my bowels shall groan for Moab like a harp, and my inward parts for Kir-charess.

12. And it shall come to pass, that it shall be seen that Moab is weary on the high-places; and he will come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not accomplish aught.

13. This is the word that the Lord hath spoken concerning Moab in former times.

14. But now hath the Lord spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of a hired laborer, shall the glory of Moab be rendered mean with all this his great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and inconsiderable.

## Isaiah 17

1. The doom of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is deprived of being a city, and it shall become decaying ruins.

2. Forsaken are the cities of ‘Aro’er: they shall be given up to flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.

3. And there shall cease the fortress from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: like the glory of the children of Israel shall they be, saith the Lord of hosts.

4. And it shall come to pass on that day, that the glory of Jacob shall vanish, and the fatness of his flesh shall become lean.

5. And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the standing-corn, and reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as when one gleaneth ears in the valley of Rephaim.

6. And there shall be left on it gleaning-fruit, as one shaketh an olive-tree, two or three berries on the top of the uppermost bough, four or five on the outmost branches of a fruitful tree, saith the Lord the God of Israel.

7. On that day shall a man turn his regard up to his Maker, and his eyes shall look toward the Holy One of Israel.

8. And he shall not turn his regard to the altars, the work of his hands; and he shall not look at what his fingers have made, both the groves and the sun-images.

9. On that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken ruin in a forest, and on a mountain-peak, which they left because of the children of Israel: and the land shall be desolate.

10. Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and the rock of thy strength thou hast not remembered; therefore wouldst thou plant luxuriant plantings, and wouldst set out the shoots of the stranger therein.

11. Already on the day that thou plantedst thou causedst to grow, and in the morning thou madest thy seed to blossom; but now fleeth the harvest on the day of disease and of incurable pain.

12. Woe to the raging of many people, who rage like the raging of the seas; and to the noise of nations, that make a noise like the roar of mighty waters!

13. The nations will make a noise like the roaring of many waters; but He will rebuke it, and it shall flee afar off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and as thistle-down before the tempest.

14. At eveningtide, behold, there is trouble; before yet it is morning it is no more. This is the portion of our spoilers, and the lot of those that plunder us.

## Isaiah 18

1. Woe to the land with spreading wings, which is beyond the rivers of Cush,

2. That sendeth on the sea ambassadors, and in vessels of bulrushes messengers over the face of the waters. Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation pulled and torn, to a people terrible from their beginning and onward; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!

3. All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, when the ensign is lifted up on the mountains, see ye; and when the cornet is blown, hear ye.

4. For so hath said the Lord unto me, I will take my rest, and I will look down on my dwelling-place like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.

5. For before the harvest, when the blossom is past, and the flower becometh a ripening grape, will he both cut off the tendrils with pruning-knives, and the sprigs will he remove and cut down.

6. They shall be left together unto the birds of prey of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the birds of prey shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.

7. At that time shall be brought as a present unto the Lord of hosts a people pulled and torn, and a people terrible from their beginning and onward; a nation meted out and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the Lord of hosts, the mount Zion.

## Isaiah 19

1. The doom of Egypt. Behold, the Lord rideth upon a swift cloud, and is coming to Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved because of his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in its inward parts.

2. And I will stir up Egyptians against Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his fellow; city against city, kingdom against kingdom.

3. And the spirit of Egypt shall be emptied out in its inward parts, and its counsel will I frustrate; and they will inquire of the idols, and of the charmers, and of those that have familiar spirits, and of the wizards.

4. And I will surrender the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord; and a rigorous king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the Eternal of hosts.

5. And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.

6. And the rivers shall become foul; and shallow and dried up shall become the deep streams: reeds and flags shall wither.

7. The well-rooted plants by the stream, by the mouth of the stream, and every thing sown by the stream, shall dry up, be scattered by the wind, and be no more.

8. The fishermen also shall lament, and all they that cast an angle into the stream shall mourn; and they that spread nets upon the face of the waters shall languish.

9. And ashamed shall be they that work in fine flax, and they that weave white cloth.

10. And its foundations shall be beaten down, all that build sluices shall be grieved in soul.

11. Surely fools are the princes of Zo’an, the wise of the counsellors of Pharaoh impart silly counsel: how can ye say unto Pharaoh, I am a son of the wise, a son of the ancient kings?

12. Where are they, these, thy wise men? that they may tell thee now, that they know what the Lord of hosts hath resolved on over Egypt.

13. The princes of Zo’an are become fools, deceived are the princes of Noph; and Egypt is led astray by the chiefs of its tribes.

14. The Lord hath poured out in the midst thereof a spirit of perverseness: and they have led Egypt astray in all its work, as a drunkard reeleth astray in his vomit.

15. And there shall not be for Egypt successful work, which the head or tail, palm-branch or rush, may do.

16. On that day shall Egypt be like the women: and it shall tremble and be in dread because of the waving of the hand of the Lord of hosts, which he waveth over it.

17. And the land of Judah shall become unto Egypt a terror, every one that maketh mention thereof shall be in dread, because of the counsel of the Lord of hosts, which he hath resolved against it.

18. On that day shall be five cities in the land of Egypt speaking the language of Canaan, and swearing by the Lord of hosts; "The city of destruction" shall one be called.

19. On that day shall there be all altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at its border to the Lord.

20. And it shall be for a sign and for a testimony unto the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they shall cry unto the Lord because of the oppressors, and he will send them a helper, and a chief, and he shall deliver them.

21. And the Lord will be made known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord on that day, and will do service with sacrifice and oblation; yea, they will make vows unto the Lord and perform them.

22. And the Lord will thus strike Egypt, striking and healing it: and they will return unto the Lord, and he will be entreated of them, and heal them.

23. On that day there shall be a highway out of Egypt to Asshur, and Asshur shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptians into Asshur, and the Egyptians shall serve with Asshur the Lord.

24. On that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Asshur, a blessing in the midst of the earth.

25. Whom the Lord of hosts will have blessed, saying, Blessed be my people Egypt, and Asshur the work of my hands, and my heritage Israel.

## Isaiah 20

1. In the year that Tharthan came unto Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and fought against Ashdod, and captured it;

2. At the same time spoke the Lord by means of Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loosen the sackcloth from off thy loins, and thy shoe shalt thou pull off from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.

3. And the Lord said, Just as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years as a sign and token for Egypt and for Cush:

4. So shall the king of Assyria lead away the prisoners of Egypt, and the exiles of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with uncovered buttocks, to the disgrace of Egypt.

5. And they shall be terrified, and ashamed of Cush their trust, and of Egypt their vaunt.

6. And the inhabitant of this isle shall say on that day, Behold, such is our trust, whither we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria: and how shall we then escape?

## Isaiah 21

1. The doom of the desert by the sea. As tempests in the south blow with fury; so doth it come from the desert, from a terrible land.

2. A hard vision hath been told unto me; the traitor dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. "Go up, O ‘Elam; besiege, O Media;" all sighing have I caused to cease.

3. Therefore are my loins filled with pain; pangs have seized me, like the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I am too much cramped to hear; I am too much dismayed to see.

4. My heart wandereth astray, dread affrighteth me: the evening of my pleasure hath he turned unto me into terror.

5. Prepare the table, put on the candlesticks, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield.

6. For thus hath said unto me the Lord, Go, set the watchman, what he seeth let him tell.

7. And he will see chariots, horsemen in couples, riders on asses, riders on camels; and he shall listen diligently with much heed:

8. And he calleth like a lion, Upon the watchtower, O Lord, do I stand continually in the daytime, and on my ward am I set all the nights.

9. And, behold, here cometh a chariot with men, horsemen in couples, and he commenceth and saith, Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the graven images of her gods hath he shivered unto the ground.

10. O my down-trodden people, and the son of my threshingfloor: that which I have heard from the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, have I told unto you.

11. The doom of Dumah. Unto me one calleth out of Se’ir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?

12. The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will desire, desire ye; return, come again.

13. The doom upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye caravans of Dedanim.

14. Toward him that is thirsty they bring water; the inhabitants of the land of Thema meet with suitable bread the fugitive.

15. Because from the swords are they fled, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the pressure of war.

16. For thus hath said the Lord unto me, Within yet one year, like the years of a hired laborer, shall all the glory of Kedar be at an end:

17. And the residue of the number of bows of the mighty men of the children of Kedar shall be small; for the Lord the God of Israel hath spoken it.

## Isaiah 22

1. The doom of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the roofs?

2. O noiseful, tumultuous city, joyous town? thy slain ones are not slain with the sword, and not those that die in battle.

3. All thy rulers are fled together, they are made prisoners by the bowmen: all that are found in thee are made prisoners together, who have run away from afar.

4. Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly; be not urgent to comfort me, because of the wasting of the daughter of my people.

5. For a day of confusion, and of treading down, and of perplexity hath the Lord Eternal of hosts in the valley of vision; walls are broken, and crying is heard against the mountain.

6. And ‘Elam beareth the quiver, cometh with men in chariots and horsemen, and Kir uncovereth the shield.

7. And it is so, that thy choicest valleys are full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array against the gate.

8. And he laid open the covering of Judah; and thou didst look on that day toward the armor of the house of the forest.

9. And the breaches of the city of David have ye seen, that they are many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool.

10. And the houses of Jerusalem have ye numbered, and ye have pulled down the houses to fortify the wall.

11. And a tank have ye made between the two walls for the water of the old pool; but ye have not looked at the Maker thereof, him that fashioned it in distant times have ye not regarded.

12. And the Lord Eternal of hosts called on that day for weeping, and for mourning, and for baldness, and for girding with sackcloth.

13. And behold there are gladness and joy, slaying of oxen, and killing of sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: "Let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we must die."

14. And it was revealed in my ears by the Lord of hosts: Surely this iniquity shall not be forgiven unto you until ye die, said the Lord the Eternal of hosts.

15. Thus hath said the Lord, Go, get thee unto this treasurer, even unto Shebna, who is superintendent over the house;

16. What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewn out for thyself here a sepulchre, the man that hath hewn out on high his sepulchre, that holloweth out in the rock a habitation for himself?

17. Behold, the Lord will thrust thee about with a mighty throw, O man! and will lay fast hold of thee;

18. He will roll thee up as a bundle, and toss thee like a ball into a country of ample space: there shalt thou die, and there shall remain the chariots of thy glory, thou disgrace of the house of thy lord.

19. And I will cast thee out from thy station, and from thy post shall he pull thee down.

20. And it shall come to pass on that day, that I will call my servant, for Elyakim the son of Chilkiyahu.

21. And I will clothe him with thy robe, and thy girdle will I fasten around him, and thy government will I place into his hand: and he shall be as a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.

22. And I will lay the key of the house of David upon his shoulder; so that he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.

23. And I will fasten him as a tent-nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a chair of honor to his father’s house.

24. And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father’s house, the shoots and offshoots, all the small vessels, from the vessels of basins, even to all the vessels of flagons.

25. On that day, saith the Lord of hosts, shall be removed the nail that is fastened in the sure place, and be cut down, and fall; and the burden that is upon it shall be cut off; for the Lord hath spoken it.

## Isaiah 23

1. The doom of Tyre. Wail, ye ships of Tharshish; for it is laid waste, without house, without entrance: from the land of Kittim hath it been revealed to them.

2. Be silent, ye inhabitants of the coast-land: the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea formerly filled thee.

3. And on mighty waters came the seed of Shichor, the harvest of the stream, as her revenue; and she became the mart of nations.

4. Be ashamed, O Zion; for spoken hath the sea, the stronghold of the sea, saying, I travailed not, nor brought forth children, neither did I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins.

5. As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they tremble at the report of Tyre.

6. Pass ye over to Tharshish; wail, ye inhabitants of the coast-land.

7. Is this your fate, ye of the joyous city? she whose antiquity is of ancient days—her own feet shall carry her, afar off to sojourn.

8. Who hath resolved this against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traders are the honorable of the earth?

9. The Lord hath resolved it, to dishonor the pride of all ornament, to make of light esteem all the honorable of the earth.

10. Pass through thy land as a stream, O daughter of Tharshish: there is no more strength.

11. He hath stretched out his hand over the sea, he hath shaken kingdoms; the Lord hath given a command against Canaan, to subvert its strongholds.

12. And he said, Thou shalt no longer rejoice any more, O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to the Kittim; also there shalt thou have no rest.

13. Behold the land of the Chaldeans—this people which was not, Asshur founded it for the dwellers in the wilderness—they have set up their watchtowers, have overthrown its palaces, have rendered it a heap of ruins.

14. Wail, ye ships of Tharshish; your stronghold is laid waste.

15. And it shall come to pass on that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, like the days of one king: at the end of seventy years shall it happen to Tyre as in the song of the harlot.

16. "Take the harp, go round about the city, thou forgotten harlot; make sweet music, sing many songs, in order that thou mayest be remembered."

17. And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the Lord will visit Tyre, and she shall return to her hire, and shall have commerce with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.

18. And her gain and her hire shall be holy to the Lord: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; but for those that dwell before the Lord shall her gain be, to eat to fulness, and for magnificent clothing.

## Isaiah 24

1. Behold, the Lord maketh empty the land, and layeth it waste, marreth its surface, and scattereth abroad its inhabitants.

2. And it shall be with the people as with the priest; with the servant as with his master; with the bondwoman as with her mistress; with the buyer as with the seller; with the lender as with the borrower; with the debtor as with his creditor.

3. Empty, emptied out shall be the land, and spoiled, utterly spoiled; for the Lord hath spoken this word.

4. The land mourneth, withereth away, the world languishes, withereth away, the high ones of the people of the land do languish.

5. For the land was defiled under its inhabitants; because they had transgressed the laws, neglected the statutes, broken the everlasting covenant.

6. Therefore hath the curse devoured the land, and they that dwell therein suffer for their guilt; therefore are the inhabitants of the land dried up, and but few men are left.

7. The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merry-hearted sigh.

8. At rest is the mirth of the tambourines; ceased hath the tumult of the joyful; at rest is the mirth of the harp.

9. Amidst singing shall they no more drink wine; bitter shall be the strong drink to those that drink it.

10. Broken down is the city of desolation; shut up is every house that none can enter.

11. A painful cry for wine is in the streets; darkened is all joy; banished is the mirth of the land.

12. Destruction is left in the city, in ruins is beaten the gate.

13. For thus shall it be in the midst of the land among the nations, as at the shaking of an olive-tree, as at the gleaning of grains when the vintage is done.

14. These shall lift up their voice, they shall sing; because of the majesty of the Lord, they shout aloud from the sea.

15. Therefore in the valleys honor ye the Lord; in the isles of the sea, the name of the Lord the God of Israel.

16. From the edge of the earth have we heard songs, "Glory to the righteous." But I said, "Evil is mine, evil is mine, woe is me! the treacherous have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously."

17. Fear, and the pit, and the snare are upon thee, O inhabitant of the land.

18. And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the call of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be caught in the snare; for the windows from on high are opened, and there quaked the foundations of the earth.

19. Crushed entirely is the earth, split in pieces is the earth, shaken to its centre is the earth.

20. The earth reeleth to and fro like a drunkard, and vibrateth like a watch-hut; and heavily lieth upon it its transgression; and it shall fall, and not rise again.

21. And it shall come to pass on that day, that the Lord will visit punishment on the host of heaven in heaven, and on the kings of the earth upon the earth.

22. And they shall be gathered in heaps, as prisoners, in the prison, and shall be shut up in the dungeon, and thus after many days shall they be punished.

23. And the moon shall be put to the blush, and the sun be made ashamed; for the Lord of hosts will reign on mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients in glory.

## Isaiah 25

1. O Lord, my God art thou; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things, resolves of distant times are become faithful confirmation.

2. For thou hast made of a city a stone-heap; of a fortified town a falling ruin; the palace of barbarians ceaseth out of the city, to eternity shall it not be rebuilt.

3. Therefore shall a strong people honor thee; the town of the tyrannical nations shall fear thee.

4. For thou hast become a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy when he is distressed; a protection from the tempest, a shadow from the heat; for the wrathful breath of the tyrants is like the tempest against a wall.

5. Like heat in a dry land, wilt thou subdue the tumult of the barbarians; as the heat is lessened by the shadow of the cloud, so will he subdue the song of the tyrants.

6. And the Lord of hosts will make unto all the nations on this mountain a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.

7. And he will destroy on this mountain the face of the covering which covereth all the people, and the vail that is spread over all the nations.

8. He will destroy death to eternity: and the Lord Eternal will wipe away the tear from off all faces; and the shame of his people will he remove from off all the earth; for the Lord hath spoken it.

9. And men will say on that day, Lo, this is our God, for whom we have waited that he would help us; this is the Lord for whom we have waited, we will be glad and we will rejoice in his salvation.

10. For the hand of the Lord will rest on this mountain, and Moab shall be trodden down on his own place, even as straw is trodden down upon the dunghill.

11. And he will spread forth his hands in the midst thereof, as the swimmer spreadeth them forth to swim: and he will bring down his pride together with the joints of his hands.

12. And the fortress of the stronghold of thy walls he bringeth down, layeth low, casteth it to the ground, even to the dust.

## Isaiah 26

1. On that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah: A strong city have we; his aid will he grant us as walls and defence.

2. Open ye the gates, that there may enter in the righteous nation which guardeth the truth.

3. The confiding mind wilt thou keep in perfect peace; because he trusteth in thee.

4. Trust ye in the Lord unto eternity; for in Yah the Lord is everlasting protection.

5. For he bendeth down the dwellers of the height; the lofty fortress—he layeth it low; he layeth it low, along the ground; he casteth it down to the dust.

6. The foot shall tread it down, the feet of the poor, the steps of the needy.

7. The path of the just is straight: thou, most upright, dost ever level the road of the just.

8. Yea, on the path of thy judgments, O Lord, have we waited for thee; for thy name, and for the remembrance of thee, was the longing of our soul.

9. In my soul have I longed for thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek for thee; for when thy judgments are sent on the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.

10. If favor be shown to the wicked, he will not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not regard the majesty of the Lord.

11. Lord, thy hand was raised high, but they would not see: oh that they might see, and be ashamed, thy zeal for the people; yea, the fire which shall devour them—thy enemies.

12. Lord, thou wilt ordain peace for us; for also all our works hast thou accomplished for us.

13. O Lord our God, lords have had dominion over us beside thee; but of thee only would we make mention,—of thy name.

14. They are dead, they will not live again; they are departed, they will not rise again; therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made to perish every memorial of them.

15. Thou hast done more for the nation, O Lord, thou hast done more for the nation; thou hast glorified thyself: thou hast enlarged all the ends of the earth.

16. Lord, in trouble have they sought thee, they poured out earnest prayers when thy chastening was upon them.

17. Like as a pregnant woman, that is near giving birth, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs: so have we been in thy presence, O Lord.

18. We have been pregnant and in pain, but it was as though we brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the land; and the inhabitants of the world have not fallen.

19. Thy dead shall live, my dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing ye, that dwell in the dust; for a dew on herbs is thy dew, and the earth shall cast out the departed.

20. Go, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy door behind thee: hide thyself but for a little moment, until the indignation be passed away.

21. For, behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to visit the iniquity of the inhabitants of the earth on them: and the earth shall disclose her blood, and shall no more be a cover over her slain.

## Isaiah 27

1. On that day will the Lord punish with his heavy and great and strong sword leviathan the flying serpent, and leviathan the crooked servant; and he will slay the crocodile that is in the sea.

2. On that day sing ye a song of the vineyard of excellent wine.

3. "I the Lord do keep it; every moment will I water it: that no one shall hurt it, night and day will I keep it.

4. Wrath have I not: who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle? I would pass through them, and I would burn them altogether.

5. If he but take hold of my strength, make peace with me; make peace with me."

6. In the future shall Jacob yet take root; Israel shall bud and blossom, and shall fill the face of the world with fruit.

7. Hath he smitten him, as he smote the one that smote him? or was he slain with the same slaughter as those of him that were slain?

8. In measure, by driving him forth, thou strivest with him: he removed him with his violent storm on the day of the east wind.

9. Therefore by this only shall the iniquity of Jacob be atoned; and this shall be all the fruit of the taking away of his sin; when he maketh all the stones of the altar as limestones that are beaten in pieces, when there shall not arise again any groves and sun-images.

10. For by this the fortified city shall be desolate, the habitation be forsaken, and left like a wilderness; there shall the calf feed, and there shall it lie down, and consume its branches.

11. When its boughs are withered, they shall be broken off; women will come and set them on fire; for it is not a people of understanding; therefore he that made it will not have mercy on it, and he that formed it will show it no favor.

12. And it shall come to pass on that day, that the Lord will beat off the fruit from the channel of the River up to the brook of Egypt; but ye shall be gathered up one by one, ye children of Israel.

13. And it shall come to pass on that day, that the great cornet shall be blown, and then shall come those who are lost in the land of Asshur, and those who are outcasts in the land of Egypt, and they shall prostrate themselves before the Lord on the holy mount at Jerusalem.

## Isaiah 28

1. Woe to the crown of pride, of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of his glorious ornament, which is on the eminence of the fat valley of those who are struck down by wine!

2. Behold, it cometh mighty and strong from the Lord, as a tempest of hail, a storm of destruction; as a tempest of mighty overflowing waters, will he cast it down to the earth with force.

3. Under feet shall be trodden the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim:

4. And the fading flower of his glorious ornament, which is on the eminence of the fat valley, shall be as its early ripe fruit before the summer; which one, when he just seeth it, while it is scarcely in his hand, hastily devoureth.

5. On that day will the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,

6. And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to those that drive back the battle to the gate of the enemy.

7. But these also are now stumbling through wine, and reeling through strong drink: priest and prophet are stumbling through strong drink, they are overpowered with wine, they reel through strong drink; they stumble in divine vision, they are unsteady in giving judgment.

8. For all tables are full of vomit of filthiness, there is no place clean.

9. Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he give to understand doctrine? those that are weaned from the milk, those that are taken from the breasts.

10. For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little.

11. For as with stammering lips and a foreign tongue will he speak to this people;

12. When he said unto them, This is the rest, cause ye the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing; but they would not hear.

13. Therefore shall be unto them the word of the Lord, precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; in order that they may go, and stumble backward, and be broken, and snared, and caught.

14. Therefore hear the word of the Lord, ye scornful men, who rule this people that is in Jerusalem.

15. Because ye have said, "We have entered into a covenant with death, and with the nether world have we made an agreement; the overflowing scourge, when it passeth by, shall not come at us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we sought a hiding-place."

16. Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I have laid in Zion as a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a costly corner-stone, well founded: he that believeth will not make haste.

17. And I will make of justice a measuring line, and of righteousness a plummet: and the hail shall sweep off the refuge of lies, and the hiding-place against the waters shall these flood away.

18. And your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with the nether world shall not have permanence; the overflowing scourge, when it passeth by—then shall ye be trodden down by it.

19. As often as it passeth by shall it take you; for morning by morning shall it pass by, by day and by night; and the mere understanding of the report shall cause terror.

20. For the bed shall be too short for a man to stretch himself out on it: and the covering too narrow to wrap himself in.

21. For as on mount Perazim will the Lord rise up, as in the valley of Gib’on will he be wroth, that he may do his work, his singular work; and to accomplish his labor, his strange labor.

22. And now be ye no longer scornful, lest your bonds be made strong; for as completed and fully decreed have I heard it from the Lord Eternal of hosts over all the earth.

23. Give ye ear, and hear my voice; listen, and hear my speech.

24. Doth the ploughman plough all the time to sow? doth he open and harrow his ground continually?

25. Is it not so? that, when he hath made level its surface he scattereth fennel, and streweth about cumin, and planteth the wheat in rows, and barley on its assigned place, and millet on its proper spot?

26. For his God instructed him rightly, taught him so to do.

27. Truly not with a threshing instrument is fennel threshed, and a wagon-wheel is not turned about upon cumin; but fennel is beaten out with a staff, and cumin with a stick.

28. Bread-corn is crushed; but not for ever doth man keep threshing it; and though he drive over it the wheel of his wagon and his horses, he will not thereby crush it.

29. This also cometh forth from the Lord of hosts; wonderful is he in counsel, and excellent in his wise deeds.

## Isaiah 29

1. Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the town where David dwelt! add ye year to year; let the festivals come round in order;

2. Yet will I distress Ariel, and there shall be groaning and wailing: and it shall be unto me like Ariel.

3. And I will encamp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with hostile posts, and I will raise up entrenchments against thee.

4. And brought down low, shalt thou speak as though out of the earth, and out of the dust shall come forth thy speech; and like one of a familiar spirit out of the earth shall be thy voice, and out of the dust shalt thou whisper forth thy speech.

5. And like the small dust shall be the multitude of thy barbarian enemies, and like the passing chaff the multitude of tyrants; and this shall be at unawares, suddenly.

6. From the Lord of hosts shall the visitation come with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the devouring flame of fire.

7. And as a dream of a night-vision shall be the multitude of all the nations that go to war against Ariel, even all that fight against her and raise towers against her, and that distress her.

8. And it shall even be as when a hungry man dreameth, that, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty; or as when a thirsty man dreameth, that, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul yet longeth: so shall it be with the multitude of all the nations, that go to war against mount Zion.

9. Stay but still and wonder; turn your eyes away, and be blinded; they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.

10. For the Lord hath poured out over you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes: over the prophets, and your chiefs, the seers, hath he cast a vail.

11. And the vision of every thing is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that can read, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed:

12. And the book is then delivered to one that cannot read, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I cannot read.

13. And the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is but the acquired precept of men;

14. Therefore, behold, I will do yet farther a marvelous work with this people, doing wonder on wonder; so that the wisdom of their wise men shall be lost, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hidden.

15. Woe unto those that seek to hide deeply their counsel from the Lord, so that their works may be in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?

16. Oh your perverseness! shall the potter be esteemed as the clay? that the work shall say of its maker, He hath not made me? or shall the thing framed say of its framer, He had no understanding?

17. Lo! but yet a very little while more, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest!

18. And on that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and out of obscurity, and out of darkness, shall the eyes of the blind see.

19. And the sufferers shall have abundant joy in the Lord, and the needy among men shall be glad in the Holy One of Israel.

20. For the tyrant is no more, and consumed is the scorner, and cut off are all that watch for injustice;

21. That cause mankind to sin by their word; and lay a snare for him that reproveth them in the gate; and pervert through fraud the cause of the just.

22. Therefore thus hath said the Lord unto the house of Jacob, he who hath redeemed Abraham, Not now shall Jacob be ashamed, and not now shall his face be made pale.

23. For when he seeth his children, the work of my hands in the midst of him, how they sanctify my name: then will they sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and the God of Israel will they reverence.

24. They also that were erring in spirit shall acquire understanding, and they that murmured shall obtain instruction.

## Isaiah 30

1. Woe to the rebellious children, saith the Lord, that take counsel, but not from me; and that set themselves a ruler, but not by my spirit, in order that they may add sin to sin:

2. That travel to go down into Egypt, and have not asked my will; to strengthen themselves through the strength of Pharaoh, and to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt!

3. Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh become your shame, and the shelter in the shadow of Egypt your disgrace.

4. For his princes were at Zo’an, and his ambassadors had reached Chanes.

5. They all are ashamed because of a people that cannot profit them, neither be a help nor give profit; but bringeth shame, and also a reproach.

6. The doom of the beasts of the south: Through the land of trouble and anguish, whence come the lioness and the lion, the viper and flying dragons, they will carry upon the shoulders of young asses their riches, and upon the humps of camels their treasures, to a people that cannot profit.

7. And the Egyptians will help in vain, and to no purpose; therefore have I called this, Boasters they are in sitting still.

8. Now go, write it before them on a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the latest time to come, for ever, and to eternity:

9. For this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the Lord:

10. Who have said to the seers, Ye shall not see; and to the prophets, Reveal not unto us true things, speak unto us smooth things, reveal deceits;

11. Depart you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, remove from before us the Holy One of Israel.

12. Therefore thus hath said the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and lean thereon for aid:

13. Therefore shall this iniquity be to you as a threatening breach, swelling out in a high-towering wall, the fall of which will come unawares, suddenly.

14. And he will break it, as one breaketh a potter’s vessel, dashing it in pieces without sparing it; so that there cannot be found among its fragments a sherd to rake fire from a hearth and to draw water from a pit.

15. For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, the Holy One of Israel, In repose and rest shall ye be helped; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength; and ye would not.

16. And ye said, "No; for upon horses will we flee;" therefore shall ye flee: and, "Upon swift beasts will we ride;" therefore shall your pursuers be swift.

17. One thousand shall flee at the threatening of one; at the threatening of five shall ye all flee: till ye be left as a pole upon a mountain-top, and as an ensign on a hill.

18. And therefore will the Lord wait, to be gracious unto you, and therefore will he exalt himself, to have mercy upon you; for a God of justice is the Lord: happy are all those that wait for him.

19. For O people of Zion that shall dwell at Jerusalem! thou shalt indeed not weep: he will be surely gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; so soon as he heareth it, he answereth thee.

20. And the Lord will give you bread in adversity, and water in oppression; and thy teachers shall not have to hide themselves in a corner any more, but thy eyes shall see thy teachers:

21. And thy ears shall hear the word behind thee, saying, "This is the way, walk ye in it," when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.

22. And ye will regard as unclean the covering of thy graven idols of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou wilt cast them away as a filthy thing; "Get thee hence," wilt thou say unto them.

23. Then will he give the rain for thy seed, that thou mayest sow in the ground; and bread—the produce of the ground—this shall be fat and nutritious: thy cattle shall feed on that day in extensive pastures.

24. The oxen likewise and the young asses that till the ground shall eat salted provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.

25. And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every prominent hill, rivulets, streams of waters on the day of the great slaughter, when towers fall.

26. And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of the seven days, on the day that the Lord bindeth up the broken limbs of his people, and healeth the bruise of their wound.

27. Behold, the name of the Lord cometh from afar, burning is his anger, and heavy the smoke; his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is like a devouring fire;

28. And his breath, like an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to toss the nations with the van of falsehood: and to place a deceiving bridle on the jaws of the people.

29. Then shall ye have a song, as in the night when a festival is ushered in, and joy of heart, as when one goeth with the flute to come unto the mountain of the Lord, to the Rock of Israel.

30. And the Lord will cause his majestic voice to be heard, and will show the stretching down of his arm, in the indignation of his anger, and in the flame of a devouring fire, in flood, and tempest, and stones of hail.

31. For because of the voice of the Lord shall be terrified Asshur, that smote you with the rod.

32. And at every passage of the appointed staff which the Lord will let fall on him, there shall be music on tambourine and harp; and in the tumult of battles will he fight with them.

33. For already of old is Topheth made ready; also this is prepared for the king—deep and wide; its pile hath fire and wood in plenty, the breath of the Lord, like a stream of sulfur, will kindle it into a flame.

## Isaiah 31

1. Woe to those that go down to Egypt for help; and depend for support on horses, and trust on chariots, because they are many; and on horsemen, because they are very strong; but who turn not unto the Holy One of Israel, and seek not the Lord!

2. Yet he also is wise, and bringeth evil, and taketh not back his words; and riseth up against the house of evil-doers, and against the help of those that work injustice.

3. But the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses are flesh, and not spirit; and the Lord will stretch out his hand, and there shall stumble the helper, and he that is helped shall fall down, and they all shall perish together.

4. For thus hath said the Lord unto me, Just as the lion or the young lion growleth over his prey, against whom is called forth the company of shepherds, of whose voice he is not afraid, and is not depressed because of their multitude: thus will the Lord come down, to fight on mount Zion and on its hill.

5. As fluttering birds, so will the Lord of hosts shield Jerusalem; shielding and delivering; sparing and preserving.

6. Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted.

7. For on that day shall every man despise his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin.

8. Then shall Asshur fall by the sword of one who is not a man; and the sword of one who is not a son of earth shall devour him; and he shall flee him from the sword, and his young men shall become tributary.

9. And his stronghold shall pass away for fear, and his princes shall be terrified because of the ensign, saith the Lord, who hath a fire in Zion, and a furnace in Jerusalem.

## Isaiah 32

1. Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in justice.

2. And every one shall be as a hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivulets of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a large rock in a languishing land.

3. And the eyes of those that see shall not be blinded again, and the ears of those that hear shall hearken.

4. The heart also of the rash shall be attentive in order to know, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.

5. The worthless person shall be no more called liberal, and the avaricious man shall not be said to be bountiful.

6. For the worthless person ever speaketh villany, and his heart will work injustice, to practise hypocrisy, and to speak error against the Lord, to leave empty the soul of the hungry, and the drink of the thirsty will he take away.

7. The instruments also of the avaricious man are evil: he deviseth wicked resolves to destroy the poor with words of falsehood, even when the needy speaketh what is right.

8. But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and he ever persisteth by liberal things.

9. Ye careless women rise up, hear my voice; ye daughters that are secure, give ear unto my speech.

10. After days and years shall ye shudder, ye women that are secure; for ended is the vintage, the fruit gathering shall nowise come.

11. Tremble, ye careless women; shudder, ye that are secure, strip off your garments and make yourselves bare, and gird sackcloth upon the loins.

12. They shall strike on the breast, lamenting, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.

13. Upon the soil of my people thorns and briers shall come up; yea, upon all the houses of joy of the gladsome town.

14. Because the palace is abandoned, the tumult of the city is forsaken; the hill and watch-tower are become dens for a long time, a joyous haunt for wild asses, a pasture for flocks.

15. Until a spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be changed into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be accounted as a forest.

16. Then shall justice dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness abide in the fruitful field.

17. And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and security for ever.

18. And then shall my people abide in peaceful dwellings, and secure abodes, and in undisturbed resting-places.

19. And it shall spread itself out in the declivity of the forest; and far down in the lowlands shall the city descend.

20. Happy are ye that sow beside all waters, freely sending forth the feet of the ox and the ass.

## Isaiah 33

1. Woe to thee that wastest, while thou wast not wasted; and traitor, while men dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt have made an end of wasting, thou shalt be wasted, and when thou shalt have finished to deal treacherously, men shall deal treacherously with thee.

2. O Lord, be gracious; we have waited for thee: be thou their support every morning, also our salvation in the time of trouble.

3. At the noise of thy thunder people fled; when thou liftedst thyself up nations were scattered.

4. And your spoil shall be gathered as the cricket gathereth: as locusts run about, so shall people hasten after it.

5. The Lord is exalted; for he dwelleth on high; he hath filled Zion with justice and righteousness.

6. And the stability of thy times and the strength of thy happiness shall be wisdom and knowledge; the fear of the Lord is his treasure.

7. Behold, their valiant ones cry without: the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.

8. The highways lie waste, ceased hath the wayfaring traveler: he hath broken the covenant, he despiseth cities, he regardeth not man.

9. It mourneth, it languisheth—the land: Lebanon is ashamed, it is withered away; Sharon is become like a wilderness; and bereft of their fruits are Bashan and Carmel.

10. Now will I arise, saith the Lord; now will I raise myself; now will I lift myself up.

11. Ye shall be pregnant with hay, and ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath is a fire, which shall devour you.

12. And the people shall be burnt as lime: as cut-off thorns shall they blaze up in fire.

13. Hear, ye distant ones, what I have done; and acknowledge ye that are near my might.

14. In Zion sinners are in dread; trembling hath seized on hypocrites. "Who among us shall abide with the devouring fire? who among us shall abide with everlasting burnings?"

15. He that walketh in righteousness, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands against taking hold of bribes, that stoppeth his ears against hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes against looking on evil;

16. He shall dwell on high; rocky strongholds shall be his refuge: his bread shall be given him; his water shall be sure.

17. The king in his beauty shall thy eyes behold: they shall see a far-off land.

18. Thy heart shall meditate on past terror. "Where is who wrote down? where is he that weighed? where is he that counted the towers?"

19. The barbarous people shalt thou not see any more, the people of a speech too obscure to be understood, of a stammering tongue, without meaning.

20. Look on Zion, the town of our solemn assemblies; thy eyes shall see Jerusalem as an undisturbed residence, a tent that shall not be struck for removal; not one of the stakes of which shall ever be moved, and all the cords of which shall never be torn loose.

21. But there will the Lord show himself mighty unto us, in a place of rivers and streams of ample breadth; wherein no oared galley shall go, and a gallant ship shall not pass thereby.

22. For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king; he will save us.

23. Loose hang thy tacklings; they cannot well uphold strongly their mast, they cannot spread the sail. Then are divided booty and spoil in abundance, even the lame take the booty.

24. And no inhabitant shall say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be one whose iniquity is forgiven.

## Isaiah 34

1. Come near, ye nations, to hear; and ye people, hearken: let the earth hear, and all that filleth it; the world, and all things that spring forth of it.

2. For the indignation of the Lord is enkindled over all the nations, and his fury over all their army: he hath devoted them, he hath given them up to the slaughter:

3. And their slain also shall be cast out, and as regardeth their carcasses their stench shall ascend upward, and the mountains shall be melted through their blood.

4. And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together like a book: and all their host shall wither, as the leaf withereth from the vine, and as withering fruit from the fig-tree.

5. For my sword is sated in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people I have devoted to punishment.

6. The sword of the Lord is full of blood, it is enriched with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for the Lord hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.

7. And wild oxen shall sink down with them, and steers with bullocks; and their land shall be sated with blood, and their dust enriched with fat.

8. For it is the day of vengeance unto the Lord, and the year of recompense for the controversy of Zion.

9. And its brooks shall be changed into pitch, and its dust into sulfur, and its land shall become burning pitch.

10. Night and day shall it not be quenched; for ever shall ascend the smoke thereof: from generation to generation shall it lie waste; no one shall for ever and ever pass through it.

11. But pelican and hedgehog shall take possession of it; night-owl also and raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out over it the line of destruction, and the weights of desolation.

12. Their nobles—no one is there they could call to the kingdom, and all its princes shall be no more.

13. And thorns shall spring up in its palaces, nettles and brambles in its fortresses: and it shall be a habitation of monsters, and a court for ostriches.

14. And the martens shall meet with the jackals, and one goat shall call to his fellow; only the screech-owl shall rest there, and find for herself a place of repose.

15. There shall nestle the arrow-snake, and lay eggs, and hatch, and gather its young under its shadow: only vultures shall assemble there, every one with her mate.

16. Inquire out of the book of the Lord, and read: not one of these shall be absent, not one shall miss her mate; for my mouth it is that hath ordained it, and its breath it is that hath gathered them.

17. And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it out unto them by the measuring line: for ever shall they possess it, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.

## Isaiah 35

1. The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad thereat; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the lily.

2. It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice, yea, with joy and singing; the glory of the Lebanon shall be given unto it, the elegance of Carmel and Sharon; they indeed shall see the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God.

3. Strengthen ye weak hands, and stumbling knees make ye firm.

4. Say to the timid of heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God, with vengeance will he come, with God’s recompense; it is he who will come and save you.

5. Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.

6. Then shall the lame leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and brooks in the desert.

7. And the sandy waste shall be changed into a pool, and the thirsty land into springs of water: in the habitation of monsters, where each one used to lie, shall be a court for reeds and rushes.

8. And there shall be a highway and a way, and The holy way, shall it be called; no unclean one shall pass over it; but it shall be only theirs; the wayfaring man, and those unacquainted therewith, shall not go astray.

9. No lion shall be there, and no ravenous beast shall go up thereon, shall not be found there; but there shall walk the redeemed:

10. And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with song, with everlasting joy upon their head; gladness and joy shall they obtain, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.

## Isaiah 36

1. And it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib the king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and seized on them.

2. And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a strong army. And he halted by the aqueduct of the upper pool on the highway of the washer’s field.

3. Then came forth unto him Elyakim, the son of Chilkiyahu, who was superintendent over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Yoach the son of Assaph, the recorder.

4. And Rabshakeh said unto them,—Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus hath said the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherewith thou hast trusted?

5. I have said, but it was only a word uttered with the lips, I have counsel and strength for the war. Now, on whom didst thou trust, that thou rebelledst against me?

6. Behold, thou trustedst on yon cracked reed-staff, on Egypt; which, if a man lean on it, will enter into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh the king of Egypt to all that trust on him.

7. But if thou shouldst say to me, In the Lord our God have we trusted: is he not the one whose high-places and whose altars Hezekiah hath removed, when he said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Before this altar shall ye prostrate yourselves?

8. And now I pray thee, enter into a contest with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.

9. How then wilt thou turn back the face of a single chieftain of the least of my masters’ servants, while thou hast put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?

10. And now am I come up without the Lord‘s will against this land to destroy it? The Lord hath said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.

11. Then said Elyakim and Shebna and Yoach unto Rabshakeh, Speak, we pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jewish language, before the ears of the people that are on the wall.

12. But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master then sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? is it not rather to the men who sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own excrements, and drink their own urine with you?

13. Then stood Rabshakeh up, and called out in a loud voice in the Jewish language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.

14. Thus hath said the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you;

15. Neither let Hezekiah induce you to trust in the Lord, saying, The Lord will surely deliver us; this city shall not be given up into the hand of the king of Assyria.

16. Hearken not to Hezekiah; for thus hath said the king of Assyria, Make a treaty of peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern;

17. Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.

18. So that Hezekiah may not mislead you, saying, The Lord will deliver us. Have the gods of the nations delivered each his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

19. Where are the gods of Chamath and Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvayim? and have they then delivered Samaria out of my hand?

20. Who are they among all the gods of these countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?

21. But they remained silent, and answered him not a word; for it was the king’s command, saying, Ye shall not answer him.

22. Then came Elyakim the son of Chilkiyahu, that was superintendent over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Yoach the son of Assaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent; and they told him the words of Rabshakeh.

## Isaiah 37

1. And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord.

2. And he sent Elyakim, who was superintendent over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet.

3. And they said unto him, Thus hath said Hezekiah, A day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of derision is this day; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.

4. Perhaps the Lord thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to blaspheme the living God, and who hath reproached with the words which the Lord thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up a prayer for the remnant that is still found here.

5. And the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

6. And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus hath said the Lord, Be not afraid because of the words which thou hast heard, with which the boys of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.

7. Behold, I will put an other spirit in him, and when he will hear a rumor, he shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.

8. And Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.

9. And he heard it said of Thirhakah the king of Ethiopia, He is come out to fight with thee. And when he had heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

10. Thus shall ye say to Hezekiah the king of Judah, as followeth, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given up into the hand of the king of Assyria.

11. Behold, thou thyself hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands by destroying them utterly: and thou alone shouldst be delivered?

12. Have the gods of the nations which my fathers destroyed delivered them, as Gozan, and Charan, and Rezeph, and the children of ‘Eden, who were in Thelassar?

13. Where is the king of Chamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvayim, of Hena’, and ‘Ivvah?

14. And Hezekiah took the letter out of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the Lord, and spread it out before the Lord.

15. And Hezekiah prayed unto the Lord, saying,

16. O Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, who dwellest between the cherubim, thou art the true God, thou alone, for all the kingdoms of the earth; for it is thou who hast made the heavens and earth.

17. Bend down, O Lord, thy ear, and hear; open, O Lord, thy eye, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he hath sent to blaspheme the living God.

18. Truly, Lord, the kings of Assyria have devastated all the nations, and their land;

19. And they have placed their gods into the fire; for they are no gods, but the work of man’s hands, wood and stone; and these have they destroyed.

20. And now, O Lord our God, save us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord, thou alone.

21. Then sent Isaiah the son of Amoz unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me concerning Sennacherib the king of Assyria:

22. This is the word that the Lord hath spoken over him: She despiseth thee, she laugheth thee to scorn, the virgin daughter of Zion; behind she shaketh her head, the daughter of Jerusalem.

23. Whom hast thou blasphemed, and whom hast thou scorned? and against whom hast thou raised thy voice, and lifted up thy eyes on high? against the Holy One of Israel.

24. Through thy servants hast thou blasphemed the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I indeed come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down its tall cedars, the choice of its fir-trees: and I will enter into the height of its summit, the forest of its fruitful soil.

25. I have dug, and drunk water; and I will dry up with the sole of my feet all the streams of besieged places.

26. Hadst thou not heard, that in distant ages I had prepared this? in the times of antiquity when I formed it? now have I brought it along, and it came to pass to desolate into ruinous heaps fortified cities.

27. And thus their inhabitants were of short power, they were discouraged and confounded: they were as the herbs of the field, and as the green grass; as the moss on the housetops, and as corn blasted before the ear appeareth.

28. But thy abiding, and thy going out, and thy coming in do I know, and thy raging against me.

29. Because of thy raging against me, and thy tumult, that is come up into my ears, will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle between thy lips, and I will cause thee to turn back on the way by which thou camest.

30. And this shall be unto thee the sign, Ye shall eat this year what groweth of itself, and in the second year what springeth after the same; and in the third year sow, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.

31. And the remnant of the house of Judah that is escaped shall yet strike root downward, and bear fruit upward.

32. For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and that which escapeth out of Mount Zion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.

33. Therefore thus hath said the Lord concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, and he shall not shoot an arrow thereon, nor come before it with shields, nor cast up an embankment against it.

34. On the way by which he came, by the same shall he return, and into this city shall he not come, saith the Lord.

35. And I will shield this city to save it for my own sake, and for the sake of David my servant.

36. Then went out an angel of the Lord, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty and five thousand men; and when people arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.

37. And Sennacherib the king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.

38. And it came to pass, as he was prostrating himself in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Essar-chaddon his son became king in his stead.

## Isaiah 38

1. In those days Hezekiah fell sick unto death; and there came unto him Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet, and said unto him, Thus hath said the Lord, Give thy charge to thy house; for thou shalt die, and not live.

2. Then did Hezekiah turn his face to the wall, and prayed unto the Lord.

3. And he said, O Lord, I beseech thee remember now that I have walked before thee in truth, and with an undivided heart, and have done what is good in thy eyes. And Hezekiah wept aloud.

4. Then came the word of the Lord to Isaiah, saying,

5. Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus hath said the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.

6. And out of the hand of the king of Assyria will I deliver thee and this city; and I will shield this city.

7. And this shall be unto thee the sign from the Lord, that the Lord will do this thing which he hath spoken:

8. Behold, I will cause the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down on the dial of Achaz by the sun, to return backward ten degrees. So the sun returned ten degrees, by the degrees which he was gone down.

9. The writing of Hezekiah the king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:

10. I had said, In the midst of my days, must I enter the gates of the nether world; I am deprived of the residue of my years.

11. I had said, I shall not see the Lord, the Lord, in the land of the living: I shall not behold man any more among the inhabitants of the regions of death.

12. My dwelling is broken down, and is removed from me as a shepherd’s tent: I have cut off, like a weaver, my life; with pining sickness will he snatch me away: from day until night wilt thou make an end of me.

13. I waited with patience till morning, whether as a lion, so would he break all my bones: from day until night wilt thou make an end of me.

14. Like a swallow or a crane, so did I chirp; I did moan like a dove; my eyes were lifted up on high: O Lord, I am oppressed; grant me ease.

15. What shall I speak? he hath promised it unto me, and he hath also accomplished it; I will make pilgrimages to God’s house all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.

16. O Lord, by these things men will live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou give me health, and cause me to live.

17. Behold, for peace I had great bitterness; but thou hast, in loving my soul, delivered it from the pit of corruption; for thou hast cast behind thy back all my sins.

18. For the nether world will not thank thee, death will not praise thee: they that go down into the pit will not hope for thy truth.

19. The living, the living alone shall thank thee, like me this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.

20. The Lord is there to help me; therefore we will play my hymns all the days of our life in the house of the Lord.

21. And Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the inflammation, and he shall recover.

22. And Hezekiah had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the Lord?

## Isaiah 39

1. At that time sent Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, the king of Babylon, letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he had heard that he had been sick, and was become strong again.

2. And Hezekiah was rejoiced on their account, and showed them his treasure-house, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the whole of his armor-house, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing that Hezekiah showed them not, in his house, and in all his dominion.

3. Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What did these men say? and whence did they come unto thee? And Hezekiah said, From a far-off country are they come unto me, from Babylon.

4. And he said, What did they see in thy house? And Hezekiah said, all that is in my house have they seen; there is nothing that I did not show them in my treasures.

5. And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the Lord of hosts,

6. Behold, days are coming when all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the Lord.

7. And of thy sons that will issue from thee, whom thou wilt beget, shall they take; and they shall be court-servants in the palace of the king of Babylon.

8. Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the Lord which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and stability in my days.

## Isaiah 40

1. Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.

2. Speak ye comfort to the heart of Jerusalem, and call out unto her, that her time of sorrow is accomplished, that her iniquity is atoned for; for she hath received from the hand of the Lord double for all her sins.

3. A voice calleth out, In the wilderness make ye clear the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for God.

4. Every valley shall be raised, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the crooked shall be made a straight path, and the rough places a plain:

5. And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed; and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.

6. A voice saith, Proclaim; and he saith, What shall I proclaim? all flesh is grass, and all its goodliness is as the flower of the field:

7. The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; because the breath of the Lord hath blown upon it; surely the people is grass.

8. The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God will stand firm for ever.

9. Upon a high mountain get thee up, thou that bringest good tidings to Zion; lift up with strength thy voice, thou who bringest good tidings to Jerusalem; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold, here is your God!

10. Behold, the Lord Eternal will come with might, and his arm ruleth for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.

11. Like a shepherd will he feed his flock: with his arm will he gather the lambs, and in his bosom will he carry them, will he lead gently those that suckle their young.

12. Who hath measured in the hollow of his hand the waters, and meted out the heavens with the span, and comprised in a measure the dust of the earth, and weighed in the scale-beam the mountains, and the hills in balances?

13. Who hath meted out the Spirit of the Lord? and who was his counsellor that he could have given him information?

14. With whom took he counsel, that he gave him understanding, and taught him the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and caused him to know the way of understanding?

15. Behold, nations are as a drop out of a bucket, and as the small dust of the balance are they accounted: behold, isles are like the flying dust.

16. And Lebanon is not sufficient for burning, and its beasts do not suffice for burnt-offering.

17. All the nations are as naught before him; less than nothing, and vanity are they accounted to him.

18. To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?

19. The graven image the artificer hath cast and the goldsmith hath overspread it with gold, and fabricated on it silver chains.

20. He that is skilled in the choice chooseth a wood that will not rot; he seeketh unto himself a skilful workman to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.

21. Know ye not? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not paid attention to the foundations of the earth?

22. It is he that dwelleth above the circle of the earth, while its inhabitants are as grasshoppers; that stretched out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in;

23. That bringeth princes to naught; rendering the judges of the earth as vanity.

24. Yes, they were not yet planted; yea, they were not yet sown; yea, their stem had not yet taken root in the earth: when he but breathed upon them, and they withered, and the storm-wind carrieth them away as stubble.

25. To whom then will ye liken me, that I should be equal to? saith the Holy One.

26. Lift up your eyes on high, and see who hath created these? he that bringeth out their host by number; that calleth them all by name; from the Mighty One not one escapeth.

27. Why wilt thou say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, My way is hidden from the Lord, and my cause hath passed from the cognizance of my God?

28. Dost thou not know? hast thou not heard? The God of everlasting is the Lord, is the Creator of the ends of the earth; he will not be faint and weary; unsearchable is his understanding.

29. He giveth to the faint strength; and to the powerless he imparteth much might.

30. Though youths should grow faint and be weary, and young men should utterly stumble:

31. Yet they that wait upon the Lord shall acquire new strength, they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk, and not become faint.

## Isaiah 41

1. Keep silence before me, O islands; and let nations acquire new strength: let them approach, then let them speak, together let us come near to judgment.

2. Who waked up from the east the man whom righteousness met in his steps? he giveth up nations before him, and maketh him rule over kings; that his sword may render them as the dust, as driven stubble, his bow.

3. He pursueth them, passeth along in safety, by a path which his feet have not gone over before.

4. Who hath wrought and done it? he who called the generations from the beginning; I the Lord, who am the first, and with the latest I am the same.

5. The isles saw it, and are afraid; the ends of the earth tremble; they draw near, and come.

6. They help one another; and each one saith to his brother, Be strong!

7. So the smith encouraged the melter, he that smootheth with the hammer him that striketh on the anvil; saying of the solder, It is good; and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.

8. But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend;

9. Thou, whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the midst of its chiefs, and said unto thee, Thou art my servant, I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.

10. Fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God; I strengthen thee, yea, I help thee, yea, I uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.

11. Behold, ashamed and confounded shall be all that were incensed against thee; they shall be as naught and perish—the men that strive with thee.

12. Thou wilt seek them, and shalt not find them, the men that contend with thee; they shall be as naught and as nothing, the men that make war against thee.

13. For I the Lord thy God lay hold of thy right hand; I am he who saith unto thee, Fear not, I help thee.

14. Fear not, thou worm Jacob, ye few men of Israel: I myself help thee, saith the Lord, and thy redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.

15. Behold, I have rendered thee a threshing instrument, sharp, new, having many teeth: thou shalt thresh mountains, and beat them small, and shalt render the hills as chaff.

16. Thou shalt scatter them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the storm shall disperse them; but thou shalt rejoice in the Lord, in the Holy One of Israel shalt thou glorify thyself.

17. The poor and the needy seek water, and there is none; their tongue is dried up with thirst: I the Lord will answer them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.

18. I will open on naked mountain-peaks rivers, and in the midst of valleys fountains; I will change the wilderness into a pool of water, and the dry land into springs of water.

19. I will place in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia, and the myrtle, and the oil-tree; I will set in the desert the fir-tree, the pine and the box-tree together;

20. In order that they may see, and know and take it to heart, and comprehend together, that the hand of the Lord hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.

21. Produce your cause, saith the Lord: bring forward your strong reasons, saith the King of Jacob.

22. Let them bring them forward and tell us what shall happen: the former things—what are they?—tell us, that we may take it to heart, and know the result of them; or let us hear the things that are to come.

23. Tell the events that are to happen hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be astonished, and see it together.

24. Behold, ye are less than nothing, and your work less than a breath: he that is an abomination alone chooseth you.

25. I have waked up one from the north, and he cometh; from the rising of the sun one who will call on my name: and he shall over- come princes as mortar, and as the potter treadeth down the clay.

26. Who hath told it from the beginning, that we may know it? and aforetimes, that we may say, "it is right?" but indeed there is none that telleth, indeed there is none that letteth us hear, indeed there is none that heareth your words.

27. The first was I to say to Zion, Behold, there they are; and to Jerusalem will I give one that bringeth good tidings.

28. And I ever look, and there is no man; and among these there is no counsellor, that they could answer a word.

29. Behold, they all are naught; their works are nothing: wind and vanity are their molten images.

## Isaiah 42

1. Behold my servant, whom I will uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delighteth: I have put my spirit upon him, that he may bring forth justice to the nations.

2. He shall not cry, nor call out aloud, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.

3. A cracked reed will he not break, and a dimly burning wick will he not quench: unto truth shall he bring forth justice.

4. He shall not become fatigued and not be faint, till he have established justice on earth; and the isles shall wait for his law.

5. Thus hath said God the Lord, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and the things which come out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to those that walk thereon:

6. I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will lay hold on thy hand, and will keep thee, and appoint thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the nations;

7. To open blind eyes, to bring out from the dungeon the prisoner, and out of the prison-house those that dwell in darkness.

8. I am the Everlasting One, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to any other, nor my praise to graven images.

9. The former things, behold, are come to pass; and new things do I announce; before they spring forth I let you hear of them.

10. Sing unto the Lord a new song, his praise from the end of the earth; ye that go down to the sea, and all that filleth it; the isles, and their inhabitants.

11. Let resound with song the wilderness and its cities, the villages which Kedar inhabiteth: let the inhabitants of the rocks sing, let them shout forth from the top of the mountains.

12. Let them give glory unto the Lord, and in the islands declare his praise.

13. The Lord—as a mighty one will he go forth, like a man of war will he arouse his vengeance: he will shout, yea, raise the war-cry; against his enemies will he show his strength.

14. I have a long time held my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: now like a travailing woman will I cry; I will destroy and devour all together.

15. I will lay waste mountains and hills, and all their herbs will I dry up; and I will change the rivers into islands, and pools will I dry up.

16. And I will cause the blind to walk on a way that they have not known; on paths that they have not known will I lead them: I will change darkness before them into light, and crooked places into plains. These are the things which I will do, and not leave them unfulfilled.

17. They shall be turned back, they shall be ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to molten idols, Ye are our gods.

18. Ye deaf, hear; and ye blind, look up, that ye may see.

19. Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger whom I send? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the servant of the Lord?

20. Thou seest many things, but observest not; the ears are open, but he heareth not.

21. The Lord willed to do this for the sake of his righteousness; therefore he magnifieth the law, and maketh it honorable.

22. But it is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them ensnared in holes, and in prison-houses are they hidden: they are become for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.

23. Who among you will give ear to this? will hearken and listen, for the time to come?

24. Who gave up Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to plunderers? was it not the Lord? he it is against whom we have sinned; for they would not walk in his ways, neither did they hearken unto his law.

25. Therefore hath he poured out over him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it blazed all round about him, yet he regarded it not; and it burnt on him, yet he laid it not to heart.

## Isaiah 43

1. But now thus hath said the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not; for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; mine art thou.

2. Whenever thou passest through the waters, I am with thee; and through the rivers,—they shall not overflow thee: whenever thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be scorched; neither shall the flame burn on thee.

3. For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour; I have given Egypt for thy ransom, Cush and Seba in place of thee.

4. Since thou art precious in my eyes, art honorable, and I indeed do love thee: therefore will I give men in place of thee, and nations instead of thy soul.

5. Fear not, for I am with thee; from the east will I bring thy seed, and from the west will I gather thee.

6. I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Withhold not: bring my sons from afar, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;

7. Every one that is called by my name, and whom I have created for my glory; whom I have formed; yea, whom I have made.

8. Bring forward the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.

9. Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can announce this? and cause us to hear former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.

10. Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen: in order that ye may know and believe me, and understand, that I am he; before me there was no god formed, and after me there will be none.

11. I, I am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour.

12. I myself have announced it, and I have saved, and I have let it be heard, and there was no strange god among you; and ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and I am God.

13. Yea, from the first day am I he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: if I will work, is there one that can hinder it?

14. Thus hath said the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, For your sake did I send to Babylon, and in swift vessels brought I them all down, and the Chaldeans, in the ships of their joyful song.

15. I am the Lord, the Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.

16. Thus hath said the Lord, who maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;

17. Who bringeth forth chariot and horse, army and power: together shall they lie down, they shall not rise up again; they are extinct, like a wick are they quenched.

18. Remember not the former things, and ancient events regard no more.

19. Behold, I will do a new thing; now shall it spring forth; will ye not acknowledge it? I will even make in the wilderness a way, and in the desert rivers.

20. The beasts of the field shall honor me, the monsters and the ostriches; because I give waters in the wilderness, rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my elect;

21. This people which I have formed for myself; my praise shall they relate.

22. But on me hast thou not called, O Jacob; for thou art become weary of me, O Israel.

23. Thou hast not brought unto me the lamb of thy burnt-offerings; and with thy sacrifices hast thou not honored me: I have not troubled thee with meat-offerings, nor wearied thee with frankincense.

24. Thou hast not bought for me sweet cane, and with the fat of thy sacrifices hast thou not satisfied me; but thou hast troubled me with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thy iniquities.

25. I, it is I that blot out thy transgressions for my own sake, and thy sins I will not remember.

26. Put me in remembrance; let us plead together: relate thou, in order that thou mayest be justified.

27. Thy first father did sin, and they that plead for thee transgressed against me.

28. Therefore do I profane the holy princes, and I give up Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.

## Isaiah 44

1. Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:

2. Thus hath said the Lord thy Maker, and he that formed thee from the womb, who will help thee, Fear not, O my servant Jacob; and thou Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.

3. For as I pour water upon the thirsty land, and rain-droppings upon the dry ground: so will I pour my spirit over thy seed, and my blessing over thy offspring.

4. After they shall spring up as among grass, like willows by the water-courses.

5. This one will say, I belong to the Lord; and the other will call himself by the name of Jacob; and the other will inscribe himself with his hand unto the Lord, and surname himself by the name of Israel.

6. Thus hath said the Lord, the king of Israel, and his Redeemer, the Lord of hosts, I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no god.

7. And who, like me, will announce, and will tell it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the people of ancient times? and the future things, and those which are to happen,—let them foretell unto them.

8. Have no dread, and do not despond; have I not long since informed thee, and have told it? and ye are my witnesses: Is there a god beside me? yea, there is no rock, whom I know not.

9. The makers of graven images are all vanity; and their costly idols cannot profit; and they are their own witnesses, that they see not and know not, in order that they may be ashamed.

10. Who hath formed a god, or cast an image that profiteth nothing?

11. Behold, all his associates shall be ashamed, for the workmen themselves are but men: let them all be gathered, let them stand up, they shall be terrified, they shall be ashamed together.

12. The iron-smith maketh an axe and worketh it in the coals, and with hammers he fashioneth it, and worketh it with his powerful arm; he also, when he is hungry, loseth his strength: when he drinketh no water, he becometh faint.

13. The worker in wood stretcheth out the rule; he marketh it out with chalk; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, after the beauty of a child of earth, that it may dwell in a house.

14. He felleth for himself cedars, and taketh cypress and oak, and he chooseth for himself the strongest among the trees of the forest; he planteth an ash, and the rain causeth it to grow.

15. Then doth it serve a man for burning; and he taketh thereof, and warmeth himself; he also heateth therewith, and baketh bread; he also worketh out a god, and boweth himself; he maketh of it an image, and kneeleth down thereto.

16. The half thereof hath he burnt in fire; with the half thereof will he eat flesh; he will roast food, and be satisfied; he will also warm himself, and say, Aha, I am warm, I have felt the fire:

17. And the residue thereof hath he made into a god, his graven image; he kneeleth down unto it, and boweth himself, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for my god art thou.

18. They know not, they understand not; for their eyes are daubed over, that they cannot see; their hearts, that they cannot understand.

19. And he layeth it not to heart, and hath no knowledge, no understanding, to say, The half thereof have I burnt in fire; and I have also baked upon its coals bread; I now will roast flesh, and eat it: and shall I make of its residue an abomination, before a block of wood shall I kneel?

20. He pursueth ashes; a deceived heart hath turned him aside; and he cannot deliver his soul, and will not say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?

21. Remember these things, O Jacob; and Israel, for thou art my servant: I have formed thee to be my servant, thou art this; O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten by me.

22. I have blotted out, as a vapor, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.

23. Sing, O ye heavens; for the Lord hath done it; shout, ye lowest depths of the earth; break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein; for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and on Israel will he glorify himself.

24. Thus hath said the Lord, thy Redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the Lord that hath made all things; that hath stretched forth the heavens by myself alone; that hath spread abroad the earth from my own self;

25. That frustrate the tokens of the liars, and confuseth diviners; that turneth the wise backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;

26. That fulfilleth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith of Jerusalem, It shall be inhabited; and of the cities of Judah, They shall be built, and their ruins will I raise up.

27. That saith to the deep, Be dry, and thy rivers will I dry up;

28. That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and all my pleasure shall he perform: even saying of Jerusalem, It shall be built; and the temple’s foundation shall be laid.

## Isaiah 45

1. Thus hath said the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, whom I have taken hold of by his right hand, to subdue nations before him, even the loins of kings will I ungird, to open before him city- doors, and gates that they shall not be shut;

2. I myself will go before thee, and proud eminences will I level: doors of brass will I break in pieces, and bolts of iron will I cut asunder.

3. And I will give unto thee the treasures of darkness, and riches hidden in secret places; in order that thou mayest know that I am the Lord, who call thee by thy name, the God of Israel;

4. For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my elect; and I have called thee by thy name: I have designated thee, though thou hast not known me.

5. I am the Lord, and there is none else, beside me there is no god; I assisted thee, though thou hast not known me.

6. In order that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from its setting, that there is nothing without me. I am the Lord, and there is no one else;

7. Forming the light, and creating darkness; making peace, and creating evil: I the Lord do all these things.

8. Drop down ye heavens, and let the skies distil blessing; let the earth open and let them all be fruitful of prosperity, and let righteousness spring up likewise: I the Lord have created it.

9. Woe unto him that contendeth with the one who formed him—a potsherd among the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?

10. Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou? or to the woman, What bringest thou forth?

11. Thus hath said the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and he who hath formed him, About events to come will you ask me? concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands will ye command me?

12. When I myself have made the earth, and created man upon it; when I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and I have ordained all their host.

13. I myself have waked him up in righteousness, and all his ways will I make straight: he shall build my city, and my exiles shall he dismiss free, not for purchase-money nor for presents, saith the Lord of hosts.

14. Thus hath said the Lord, The labor of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and of the Sabeans, men of high stature, shall pass over unto thee, and thine shall they be: behind thee shall they walk; in chains shall they pass along, and unto thee shall they bow, unto thee shall they pray, saying Yea, only among thee is God; and there is no one else beside God.

15. Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.

16. They are ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: together shall they go to confusion that are makers of idols.

17. But Israel shall be helped by the Lord with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed and not be confounded unto all eternity.

18. For thus hath said the Lord the creator of the heavens; he, the God that formed the earth and made it; he that hath established it,—not for naught did he create it, to be inhabited did he form it: I am the Lord; and there is no one else.

19. Not on a secret spot have I spoken, in a dark place of the earth; I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me for naught; but I the Lord speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.

20. Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye escaped fugitives of the nations! They have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.

21. Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: Who hath announced this in ancient times? told it from the beginning? is it not I the Lord? and there is no other god without me, a just god and a saviour; there is none beside me.

22. Turn unto me, so that ye may be helped, all ye ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no one else.

23. By myself have I sworn, righteousness is gone out of my mouth, a word which shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bend, every tongue shall swear.

24. Only in the Lord,—shall men say of me,—there are righteousness and strength. Unto him shall come and be ashamed all that are incensed against him.

25. In the Lord shall be justified, and shall glory themselves all the seed of Israel.

## Isaiah 46

1. Bel is bowed down, Nebo sinketh, their idols are delivered unto the beasts, and unto the cattle; those which were once carried by you are now laden up a burden to the weary beasts.

2. They are sunk, they are bowed down together; they could not deliver the burden, but they themselves are gone into captivity.

3. Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, who are borne by me from their birth, who are carried from the womb;

4. And even unto old age I am the same; and even unto the time of hoary hairs will I bear: l have done it, and I will carry you; even I will bear, and deliver you.

5. To whom will ye liken and assimilate me, and compare me, that we may be like?

6. There are those that lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance; that hire a melter, that he may make of it a god; they then bend the knee, yea, they bow themselves down;

7. They carry him, upon the shoulder they bear him, and set up him in his spot, and he remaineth standing, from his place he doth not move: yea, though one should cry unto him, he cannot answer, out of his trouble he cannot help him.

8. Remember this, and take courage: take it again to heart, O ye transgressors.

9. Remember the former things of olden times; for I am God, and there is no one else; I am God, and there is nothing like me.

10. Declaring from the beginning the end, and from the earliest days the things that have not yet been done, saying, My counsel shall stand firm, and all my pleasure will I do:

11. Calling from the east the eagle, from a far-off country the man of my counsel; yea, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also execute it.

12. Hearken unto me, ye stout of heart, that are far from righteousness:

13. I have brought near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will grant unto Zion salvation, unto Israel my glory.

## Isaiah 47

1. Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground, there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for men shall nevermore call thee, Tender and delicate.

2. Take the mill, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, lift up the train, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.

3. Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not regard any man.

4. Our redeemer—the Lord of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.

5. Sit thou silent, and enter into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for men shall never more call thee, The mistress of kingdoms.

6. I was wroth over my people, I defiled my inheritance, and gave them into thy hand: yet thou didst grant them no mercy; upon the aged hast thou laid very heavily thy yoke.

7. And thou saidst, For ever shall I be mistress; until that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, thou didst not call to mind the result thereof.

8. And now hear this, luxurious one, that dwellest in security, that sayest in thy heart, I am, and there is nothing else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:

9. Yet both these things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood; in their full measure shall they come upon thee, despite of the multitude of thy sorceries, despite of the very great abundance of thy enchantments.

10. And thou didst trust in thy wickedness: thou saidst, No one seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge,—these were they that seduced thee; and thou saidst in thy heart, I am, and there is nothing else beside me.

11. And there shall come upon thee an evil, which thou shalt not know how to remove it by prayer; and there shall fall upon thee mischief, which thou shalt not be able to atone for; and there shall come upon thee suddenly desolation, which thou shalt not know.

12. Stand now with thy enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast labored from thy youth; peradventure thou mayest be able to profit, peradventure thou mayest withstand.

13. Thou art wearied with the multitude of thy counsels. Do let now those that divide off the heavens, that look at the stars, that announce coming events at new moons, stand up, and save thee from the things that are to come over thee.

14. Behold, they are become as stubble; the fire burneth them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: not a coal shall be left to warm at, no blaze to sit before it.

15. Thus are they become unto thee with whom thou hast labored; those that had commerce with thee from thy youth, wander away every one on his road: there is no one to save thee.

## Isaiah 48

1. Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the spring of Judah, who swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel,—not in truth, nor in righteousness.

2. For of the holy city they call themselves, and upon the God of Israel they stay themselves,—The Lord of hosts is his name.

3. The former things have I declared from the beginning; and out of my mouth went they forth, and I announced them: suddenly did I accomplish them, and they came to pass;

4. Because I knew that thou art obstinate, that like an iron sinew is thy neck, and thy brow of copper;

5. And I declared it to thee from the beginning; before yet it came to pass did I let thee hear it: lest thou should say, My idol hath done these things, and my graven image, and my molten image, have ordained them.

6. Thou hast heard it; see it all now; and you—will you not declare it? I caused thee to hear new things, from this time, even hidden things which thou hadst not known.

7. Now are they created, and not from the beginning; and before the day that I announced them thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.

8. But neither hadst thou heard it; nor didst thou know; nor had in ancient times thy ear been opened; for I knew that thou wouldst deal very treacherously, and a transgressor wast thou called from thy birth.

9. For the sake of my name will I defer my anger, and because of my praise will I restrain it toward thee, so that I may not cut thee off.

10. Behold, I have refined thee, though not into silver: I have approved thee in the crucible of affliction.

11. For my own sake will I do it: for how would my name be dishonored? and my glory will I not give unto another.

12. Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and Israel, my called one; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.

13. My hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned out the heavens: I call unto them, they stand forward together.

14. Assemble yourselves, all of you, and hear: Who among them hath told these things? He whom the Lord loveth, will do his pleasure on Babylon, and display his arm on the Chaldeans.

15. I, even I, have spoken it, I have also called him: I have brought him, and he shall be prosperous on his way.

16. Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; never from the beginning have I spoken in secret; from the time that it occurred, was I there. And now the Lord Eternal hath sent me, and his Spirit.

17. Thus hath said the Lord, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, I am the Lord thy God who teach thee for thy profit, who lead thee by the way thou shouldst go.

18. Oh that thou hadst but listened to my commandments! then would have been as a river thy peace, and thy prosperity as the waves of the sea:

19. And then would have been as the sand thy seed, and the offspring of thy body like the pebbles of the sea-shore; yet shall his name not be cut off nor destroyed from before me.

20. Go forth out of Babylon, flee away from the Chaldeans, with the voice of singing declare, announce this, carry it forth as far as the end of the earth; say, The Lord hath redeemed his servant Jacob.

21. And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts; waters out of the rock he let drop down for them: and he cleaved the rock, and the waters gushed out.

22. There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked.

## Isaiah 49

1. Hearken, O isles, unto me; and listen, ye people, from afar: The Lord hath called me from my birth; from my mother’s womb hath he made mention of my name.

2. And he hath rendered my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hidden me: and he hath rendered me as a polished arrow; in his quiver hath he concealed me;

3. And said unto me, My servant art thou, O Israel, thou on whom I will be glorified.

4. But I had indeed said, For no purpose have I labored, for naught and vanity have I spent my strength; yet surely my cause is with the Lord, and the recompense of my work with my God.

5. And now hath said the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, that Israel may be gathered unto him, that I should be honored in the eyes of the Lord, while my God was my strength,—

6. And he said, It is too light a thing that thou shouldst be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to bring back the preserved of Israel! but I will also appoint thee for a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach as far as the end of the earth.

7. Thus hath said the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, to him who is despised by men, to him who is abhorred by nations, to the servant of rulers, Kings shall see it and rise up, princes, and they shall prostrate themselves, for the sake of the Lord, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who hath made choice of thee.

8. Thus hath said the Lord, In the time of favor have I answered thee, and on the day of salvation have I helped thee; and I will preserve thee, and I will appoint thee as a people of my covenant to raise up the land, to divide out desolate heritages;

9. When I say to the prisoners, Go forth; to those that are in darkness, Show yourselves. On the roads shall they feed, and on all mountain-peaks shall be their pasture.

10. They shall not be hungry nor thirsty, and neither heat nor sun shall smite them; for he that hath mercy on them will lead them, and by springs of water will he guide them.

11. And I will change all my mountains into a road, and my highways shall be lifted up.

12. Behold, these shall come from afar; and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.

13. Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth, O mountains, into song; for the Lord hath comforted his people, and upon his oppressed will he have mercy.

14. Yet Zion said, the Eternal hath forsaken me, and the Lord hath forgotten me.

15. Can a woman forget her sucking child, not to have mercy on the son of her body? yea, should these even forget, yet would I not forget thee.

16. Behold, upon the palms of my hands have I engraved thee; thy walls are continually before me.

17. Thy children come in haste; thy destroyers and they that laid thee waste shall go away from thee.

18. Lift up thy eyes round about, and see; they all are assembled together, they come to thee: as I live, saith the Lord, thou shalt surely clothe thyself with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on thee, as a bride.

19. For thy ruins and thy desolate places, and thy wasted land,—yea, now shall it be too narrow for thee by reason of the inhabitants, and thy destroyers shall be far away.

20. Yet again will say before thy ears the children of whom thou wast deprived, The place is too narrow for me; make room for me that I may dwell.

21. And thou wilt say in thy heart, Who hath born me these, seeing I was bereft of my children, and was solitary, an exile, and outcast? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left entirely alone; these, where have they been?

22. Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will lift up to the nations my hand, and to the people will I raise up high my standard; and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon shoulders.

23. And kings shall be thy nursing-fathers, and their princesses thy nursing-mothers; with the face toward the earth shall they bow down to thee, and the dust of thy feet shall they lick up: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord, who will not suffer those who hope in me to be ashamed.

24. Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or shall the captive of the victor escape?

25. For thus hath said the Lord, Also the captive of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the powerful shall escape; and with those who contend against thee will I contend, and thy children will I indeed save.

26. And I will feed thy oppressors with their own flesh; and as with new wine shall they be made drunken with their own blood: and all flesh shall know that I the Eternal am thy Saviour, and thy Redeemer the Mighty One of Jacob.

## Isaiah 50

1. Thus hath said the Lord, Where is your mother’s bill of divorcement, wherewith I have sent her away? or who of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? behold, for your iniquities were ye sold, and for your transgressions was your mother sent away.

2. Why did I come and no man was there, did I call, with none to answer? hath my hand become too short for redeeming? or is there no power in me to deliver? behold, through my threatening I can dry up the sea, I can change the rivers into a wilderness: their fish stink for want of water, and die for thirst.

3. I can clothe the heavens with blackness, and I can make sackcloth their garment.

4. The Lord Eternal hath given me a tongue for teaching, that I should know how to strengthen the weary with the word: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth my ear to listen like those who are well taught.

5. The Lord Eternal hath opened me my ear, and I resisted not: I turned not backward.

6. My back I gave up to the smiters, and my cheeks to those that plucked off the hair: my face I hid not from abuse and spitting.

7. But the Lord Eternal ever helpeth me; therefore was I not confounded; therefore have I rendered my face like a flint, and I knew that I should not be made ashamed.

8. He that justifieth me is near; who will contend with me? let us stand forward together: who hath a dispute with me? let him come near to me.

9. Behold, the Lord Eternal will help me; who is the man that will condemn me? lo, they all shall wear out as a garment: the moth shall eat them up.

10. Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that hearkeneth to the voice of his servant? though he have walked in darkness, and had no light: let him trust in the name of the Lord, and lean for support upon his God.

11. Behold, all ye that kindle fire, that urge on the brands: walk by the blaze of your fire, and by the brands ye have kindled; from my hand hath this been bestowed on you; in pain shall ye lie down.

## Isaiah 51

1. Hearken to me, ye that pursue righteousness, that seek the Lord: look unto the rock whence ye were hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye were dug up.

2. Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bore you; for he was one when I called him, and I blessed him, and I increased him.

3. Yea, the Lord hath comforted Zion; he hath comforted all her ruins; and he hath made her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord: gladness and joy shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of song.

4. Listen unto me, my people; and O my nation, give ear unto me; for a law shall proceed from me, and my justice will I establish as a light of the people.

5. My righteousness is near; my salvation goeth forth, and my arms shall judge the people: on me the isles shall wait, and for my arm shall they hope.

6. Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wear out like a garment, and they that dwell thereon shall die in like manner; but my salvation shall exist for ever, and my righteousness shall not be delayed.

7. Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, O people in whose heart my law is: ye must not fear the reproach of men, and of their revilings shall ye not be in dread.

8. For like a garment shall the moth eat them up, and like wool shall the worm eat them; but my righteousness shall exist for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.

9. Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord: awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of olden times. Art thou not it that struck down Rahab, that pierced the crocodile?

10. Art thou not it that dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; that rendered the depths of the sea a road for the redeemed to pass through?

11. And so shall the ransomed of the Lord return, and come to Zion with song, with everlasting joy upon their head; gladness and joy shall they obtain, while sorrow and sighing shall have fled away.

12. I, I am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of a mortal that must die, and of a son of man who will wither as the grass?

13. And thou forgettest the Lord, thy Maker, who hath spread out the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and thou dreadest continually, all the day, because of the fury of the oppressor, whenever he aimeth to destroy: and where is now the fury of the oppressor?

14. The exile will be speedily set free; and he shall not die in the dungeon, and his bread shall not fail.

15. For I am the Lord thy God, who stirreth up the sea that its waves roar: the Lord of hosts is his name.

16. And I have placed my words in thy mouth, and with the shadow of my hand have I covered thee: to plant the heavens, and to lay the foundations of the earth, and to say to Zion, Thou art my people.

17. Rouse up, rouse up, arise, O Jerusalem, thou who hast drunk from the hand of the Lord the cup of his fury: the deep cup of confusion hast thou drunk, hast thou drained.

18. There is none to lead her, from all the children whom she hath born; and there is none that taketh her by the hand, from all the children whom she hath brought up.

19. Two things are these which have befallen thee: who will have compassion for thee? desolation and destruction, and famine and sword—with whom shall I comfort thee?

20. Thy children have fainted, they lie at the entrance of all streets, as a wild bull caught in a net, they are those who are full of the fury of the Lord, the threatening of thy God.

21. Therefore hear now this, O thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine.

22. Thus hath said thy Lord, the Eternal, and thy God, who will ever plead for his people, Behold, I have taken out of thy hand the cup of confusion, the deep cup of my fury: thou shalt never more drink it again.

23. And I will place it in the hand of those who have tortured thee, that have said to thy soul, Bend thee down, that we may pass over; and thou madest like the earth thy back, and like the street for those that passed over.

## Isaiah 52

1. Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, thou holy city; for no more shall enter into thee henceforth the uncircumcised and the unclean.

2. Shake thyself free from the dust, arise, sit down, O Jerusalem: loosen thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive, daughter of Zion.

3. For thus hath said the Lord, For naught were you sold, and without silver shall ye be redeemed.

4. For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Into Egypt went my people down aforetimes, to sojourn there, and Asshur hath oppressed it without cause.

5. And now what have I here, saith the Lord, since my people hath been taken away for naught? its rulers vaunt aloud, saith the Lord, and continually, all the day, is my name blasphemed.

6. Therefore shall my people know my name, therefore on that day, that I am he that speaketh it: here am I.

7. How beautiful are upon the mountains the feet of the messenger of good tidings, that publisheth peace, that announceth tidings of happiness, that publisheth salvation, that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth.

8. The voice of thy watchmen,—they raise their voice, together shall they shout; for eye to eye shall they see, when the Lord returneth unto Zion.

9. Break forth in song, shout together, ye ruins of Jerusalem; the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.

10. The Lord hath made bare his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.

11. Depart ye, depart ye, go out from there, touch no unclean thing; go ye out from the midst of it; cleanse yourselves, ye bearers of the vessels of the Lord.

12. Not in haste shall ye go out, and not in flight shall ye go; for before you goeth the Lord, and your rereward is the God of Israel.

13. Behold, my servant shall be prosperous, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be placed very high.

14. Just as many were astonished at thee, so greatly was his countenance marred more than any other man’s, and his form more than that of the sons of men,—

15. Thus will he cause many nations to jump up in astonishment; at him will kings shut their mouth; for what had not been told unto them shall they see, and what they had never heard shall they understand.

## Isaiah 53

1. Who would have believed our report? and the arm of the Lord—over whom hath it been revealed?

2. Yea, he grew up like a small shoot before him, and as a root out of a dry land: he had no form nor comeliness, so that we should look at him; and no countenance, so that we should desire him.

3. He was despised and shunned by men; a man of pains, and acquainted with disease; and as one who hid his face from us was he despised, and we esteemed him not.

4. But only our diseases did he bear himself, and our pains he carried: while we indeed esteemed him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.

5. Yet he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement for our peace was upon him; and through his bruises was healing granted to us.

6. We all like sheep went astray; every one to his own way did we turn; and the Lord let befall him the guilt of us all.

7. He was oppressed, and he was also taunted, yet he opened not his mouth; like the lamb which is led to the slaughter, and like an ewe before her shearers is dumb; and he opened not his mouth.

8. Through oppression and through judicial punishment was he taken away; but his generation—who could tell, that he was cut away out of the land of life, that for the transgressions of my people the plague was laid on him?

9. And he let his grave be made with the wicked, and with the godless rich at his death; although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth.

10. But the Lord was pleased to crush him through disease: when now his soul hath brought the trespass-offering, then shall he see his seed, live many days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.

11. Freed from the trouble of his soul shall he see the good and be satisfied: through his knowledge shall my righteous servant bring the many to righteousness, while he will bear their iniquities.

12. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the many, and with the strong shall he divide the spoil; because he poured out his soul unto death, and with transgressors was he numbered: while he bore the sin of many, and for the transgressors he let evil befall him.

## Isaiah 54

1. Sing, O barren one, that thou hast not born: break forth into song, and rejoice aloud, that thou hast not travailed; for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the Lord.

2. Enlarge the space of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations,—spare not: lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes;

3. For to the right and to the left shalt thou spread forth; and thy seed shall drive out nations, desolate cities shall they repeople.

4. Fear not, for thou shalt not be made ashamed; and be not confounded, for thou shalt not be put to the blush; for the shame of thy youth shalt thou forget, and the reproach of thy widowhood shalt thou not remember any more.

5. For thy husband is thy Maker, the Lord of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel, "The God of all the earth," shall he be called.

6. For as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit did the Lord call thee back, and as a wife of youth, that was rejected, saith thy God.

7. But for a brief moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I again receive thee.

8. In a little wrath did I hide my face for a moment from thee; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith thy Redeemer the Lord.

9. For as the waters of Noah is this unto me; as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more pass over the earth: so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.

10. For the mountains may depart, and the hills may be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith he that hath mercy on thee, the Lord.

11. O thou afflicted, tossed by the tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.

12. And I will make of rubies thy battlements, and thy gates into carbuncle-stones, and all thy borders into precious stones.

13. And all thy children shall be disciples of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children.

14. In righteousness shalt thou be established: keep far from oppression, for thou shalt not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near unto thee.

15. Behold, they that assemble together, are nothing without me: whatsoever assembleth together against thee shall fall under thy power.

16. Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have also created the waster to destroy.

17. No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that will rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their due reward from me, saith the Lord.

## Isaiah 55

1. Ho, every one of ye that thirsteth, come ye to the water, and he too that hath no money: come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy without money and without price wine and milk.

2. Wherefore will ye spend money for what is not bread? and your labor for what satisfieth not? hearken then unto me, and eat what is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.

3. Incline your ear, and come unto me, hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make with you an everlasting covenant, the promised mercies of David, which are sure.

4. Behold, for a lawgiver unto the people have I appointed him, a prince and commander to the people.

5. Behold, a nation thou knowest not shalt thou call, and a nation that knew thee not shall run unto thee; for the sake of the Lord thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel, for he hath glorified thee.

6. Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found, call ye on him, while he is near.

7. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the man of unrighteousness his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and unto our God, for he will abundantly pardon.

8. For not my thoughts are your thoughts, and not your ways are my ways, saith the Lord.

9. For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so high are my ways above your ways, and my thoughts above your thoughts.

10. For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and return not thither, but water the earth, and render it fruitful, and cause it to bring forth plants; and give seed to the sower and bread to him that eateth:

11. So shall ever be my word which goeth forth from my mouth, it shall not return unto me without effect; but it accomplisheth what I desire, and it prospereth in that whereto I have sent it.

12. For in joy shall ye go out, and in peace shall ye be brought home: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into song, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.

13. Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir-tree, and instead of the nettle shall come up the myrtle; and it shall be unto the Lord for a name, for a sign of everlasting that shall not be cut off.

## Isaiah 56

1. Thus hath said the Lord, Keep ye justice, and do equity; for near is my salvation to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.

2. Happy is the mortal that ever doth this, and the son of man that ever layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath by not violating it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.

3. And let not say the son of the stranger, that joineth himself unto the Lord, saying, Surely the Lord will exclude me from his people; nor let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.

4. For thus hath said the Lord concerning the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and make choice of what pleaseth me, and take hold of my covenant.

5. I will indeed give unto them in my house and within my walls a place and a name, better than sons and daughters: an everlasting name will I give them, that shall not be cut off.

6. Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves unto the Lord, to serve him, and to love the name of the Lord, to be unto him as servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath by not violating it, and those who take hold of my covenant:

7. Even these will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon my altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations.

8. Thus saith the Lord Eternal who gathereth the outcasts of Israel, I will yet gather others to him, beside his own gathered outcasts.

9. All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts in the forest.

10. His watchmen are all of them blind, they know nothing; they all are dumb dogs, they cannot bark; dreamers, lying down, loving to slumber.

11. But the dogs are of a greedy disposition, they know not how to be satisfied; and those are shepherds that know how to understand: they all turn to their own way, every one after his gain, from all quarters.

12. Come ye, I will fetch wine, and let us swallow abundantly of strong drink; and like this day shall it be tomorrow, excellent and in very great abundance.

## Isaiah 57

1. The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and pious men are taken away, without one considering that before the evil the righteous is taken away.

2. He shall come to his fathers in peace: they shall repose in their resting-place, every one that walketh in his uprightness.

3. But ye draw near hither, sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the harlot.

4. Over whom will you make yourselves merry? concerning whom will you open wide your mouth, stretch out your tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,

5. That are inflamed after the idols under every green tree; that slaughter the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks?

6. Of the smooth stones of the valley is thy portion; they, they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured out a drink-offering, hast thou offered a meat-offering. Shall I for these things repent me of the evil?

7. Upon a high and lofty mountain hast thou placed thy couch: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.

8. And behind the doors and the door-posts hast thou placed thy mark of remembrance; for departing from me, thou hast laid open, and art gone up,—hast enlarged thy couch, and made thee a covenant with some of them; thou hast loved their lying with thee, hast selected a fitting place.

9. And thou didst show thyself unto the king without ointment, and thou didst multiply thy perfumes, and thou didst send out thy messengers even into the far-off distance, and didst debase thyself even down to the nether world.

10. Though thou art wearied by the length of thy way, yet saidst thou not, It is useless: thou hadst found enough for thy hand; therefore didst thou feel no care.

11. And of whom hadst thou dread or fear, that thou becamest false, and didst not remember me, nor lay it to thy heart? is it not so? I kept silence, and this from earliest times, and therefore thou fearest me not!

12. I, I ever tell thee what deeds would be thy righteousness; but thy works—these indeed will not profit thee.

13. When thou criest, let thy masses of idols deliver thee; but all of them will the wind carry away, a breath will take them off; but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.

14. And he will say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, clear out the way, lift up every stumbling block out of the way of my people.

15. For thus hath said the high and lofty One, who inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy, In the high and holy place do I dwell, yet also with the contrite and humble of spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.

16. For not to eternity will I contend, neither will I be for ever wroth: when the spirit from before me is overwhelmed, and the souls which I have made.

17. Because of the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and I smote him, hiding my face, and was wroth: while he went on frowardly in the way of his own heart.

18. I now see his ways, and I will heal him; and I will guide him, and bestow full comforts on him and on his mourners;

19. Creating the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace to him that is afar off, and to him that is near, saith the Lord; and I will heal him.

20. But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it can never be at rest, but its waters cast up mire and dirt.

21. There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.

## Isaiah 58

1. Cry with a full throat, spare not, like the cornet lift up thy voice, and declare unto my people their transgression, and to the house of Jacob their sins.

2. Yet me do they ever seek day by day, and to know my ways do they always desire; as a nation that hath done righteousness, and hath not forsaken the ordinance of their God: continually do they ask of me the ordinances of justice—do they desire to draw nigh unto God.

3. "Wherefore have we fasted, and thou seest it not? have we afflicted our soul, and thou regardest it not?" Behold, on the day of your fasting ye follow your business, and all your acquired gains do ye exact.

4. Behold, for contention and strife do ye fast, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye fast not so at this day, to cause your voice to be heard on high.

5. Is such then the fast which I can choose? a day that a man afflicteth his soul? to bend his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes for his couch? wilt thou call this a fast, and a day of acceptability unto the Lord?

6. Is not this rather the fast that I will choose? to open the snares of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye should break asunder every yoke?

7. Is it not to distribute thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the afflicted poor into thy house! when thou seest the naked, that thou clothe him; and that thou hide not thyself from thy own flesh?

8. Then shall break forth as the morning-dawn thy light, and thy healing shall speedily spring forth; and before thee shall go thy righteousness, the glory of the Lord shall be thy rereward.

9. Then shalt thou call, and the Lord will answer; thou shalt cry, and he will say, Here am I. If thou remove from the midst of thee the yoke, the stretching out of the finger, and speaking wickedly;

10. And if thou pour out to the hungry thy soul, and satisfy the afflicted soul: then shall shine forth in the darkness thy light, and thy obscurity be as the noonday;

11. And the Lord will guide thee continually, and will satisfy thy soul in times of famine, and will strengthen thy bones; and thou shalt be like a well-watered garden, and like a spring of water, the waters of which will never deceive.

12. And they that spring from thee shall build up the ancient ruins; the foundations of many generations shalt thou raise up again: and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breaches, The restorer of paths to the dwelling-place.

13. If thou restrain thy foot for the sake of the sabbath, not doing thy business on my holy day; and if thou call the sabbath a delight, the holy day of the Lord, honorable; and honor it by not doing thy usual pursuits, by not following thy own business, and speaking vain words:

14. Then shalt thou find delight in the Lord; and I will cause thee to tread upon the high places of the earth, and I will cause thee to enjoy the inheritance of Jacob thy father; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.

## Isaiah 59

1. Behold, the Lord’s hand is not too short to save; neither his ear too heavy for hearing;

2. But your iniquities have ever made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have caused him to hide his face from you, so that he would not hear.

3. For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity: your lips have spoken falsehood, your tongue uttereth deception.

4. No one admonisheth with righteousness, and no one executeth justice in truth; men trust in naught, and speak lies; they have conceived mischief, and bring forth wickedness.

5. Basilisk’s eggs do they hatch, and spider’s webs do they weave: he that eateth of their eggs must die, and if one be crushed, a viper will break forth.

6. Their webs cannot serve for garments, and they cannot clothe themselves with their works: their works are works of wickedness, and the deed of violence is in their hands.

7. Their feet run to what is evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of wickedness; wasting and destruction are on their highways.

8. The way of peace they know not; and there is no justice on their tracks: their paths they have made unto themselves crooked; whosoever walketh therein knoweth not peace.

9. Therefore is justice far from us, nor will happiness overtake us: we ever hope for light, but behold there is darkness; for brightness, but in obscurity must we walk.

10. We grope like the blind on the wall, and as if we had no eyes do we grope: we stumble at noonday as in the twilight; we are in complete darkness like the dead.

11. We growl all of us like bears, and like doves do we moan sorely; we ever hope for justice, but there is none; for aid, but it is far from us.

12. For our transgressions are numerous in thy presence, and our sins testify against us; for of our transgressions are we aware; and our iniquities—we know them;

13. We transgressed and denied the Lord, and departed away from our God; we spoke oppression and revolt, conceived and brought forth in our heart words of falsehood.

14. And justice is forced to turn backward, and righteousness standeth afar off; for truth stumbled in the street, and equity is not able to enter.

15. And thus is the truth missing; and he that departeth from evil is regarded as foolish: and the Lord saw it, and it was displeasing in his eyes that there was no justice.

16. And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor; therefore his arm brought him aid, and his righteousness,—yea, this sustained him.

17. And he put on righteousness as a coat of mail, and placed the helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance as raiment, and wrapped himself with zeal as with a cloak.

18. According to the demerits, so will he repay all, fury to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands will he repay what they have merited.

19. And they shall fear from the west the name of the Lord, and from the rising of the sun his glory; for there shall come distress like the stream which the Spirit of the Lord urgeth forward.

20. But unto Zion shall come the redeemer, and unto those who return from transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord.

21. And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the Lord, My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy children, nor out of the mouth of thy children’s children, saith the Lord, from henceforth and unto all eternity.

## Isaiah 60

1. Arise, give light, for thy light is come; and the glory of the Lord is shining forth over thee.

2. For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and a gross darkness the people; but over thee will shine forth the Lord, and his glory will be seen over thee.

3. And nations shall walk by thy light, and kings by the brightness of thy shining.

4. Lift up thy eyes round about and see, they all are assembled, they come to thee, thy sons are coming from afar, and thy daughters are brought along in arms.

5. Then wilt thou see and be filled with light, and thy heart will dread and be enlarged; because unto thee shall be turned the abundance of the sea, the riches of nations shall come unto thee.

6. The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and ‘Ephah; they all from Sheba shall come: gold and frankincense shall they carry, and the praises of the Lord shall they announce.

7. All the flocks of Kedar shall be assembled unto thee, the rams of Nebayoth shall minister unto thee: they shall come for a favorable acceptance unto me upon my altar, and the house of my glory will I glorify.

8. Who are these that fly like a cloud, and like the doves, to their windows?

9. Yea, unto me the inhabitants of the isles shall hasten, and the ships of Tharshish at first, to bring thy sons from afar, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name of the Lord thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel; because he hath glorified thee.

10. And the sons of the stranger shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee; for in my wrath did I smite thee, but in my favor have I had mercy on thee.

11. And thy gates shall stand open continually, day and night shall they not be closed, to bring unto thee the wealth of nations, and their kings led captive.

12. For the nation and the kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; and the nations shall be utterly destroyed.

13. The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir, the cypress, and the box together, to adorn the place of my sanctuary, and the resting place of my feet will I glorify.

14. And then shall come unto thee bent down the sons of those who afflicted thee, and there shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet all thy revilers; and they shall call thee, The city of the Lord, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.

15. Instead that thou wast forsaken and hated, without one to pass through thee, will I render thee an excellency of everlasting, a joy of all generations.

16. And thou shalt suck the milk of nations, and the breast of kings shalt thou suck; and thou shalt know that I the Lord am thy Saviour, and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.

17. Instead of the copper will I bring gold, and instead of the iron will I bring silver, and instead of wood copper, and instead of the stones iron; and I will set peace as thy authorities, and righteousness as thy taskmasters.

18. There shall not be heard any wore violence in thy land, wasting and destruction within thy boundaries; but thou shalt call, Salvation, thy walls, and thy gates, Praise.

19. The sun shall not be unto thee any more for a light by day, and for brightness shall the moon not give light unto thee; but the Lord will be unto thee for a light of everlasting, and thy God as thy glory.

20. Thy sun shall not go down any more, and thy moon shall not be withdrawn; for the Lord will be unto thee for a light of everlasting, and ended shall be the days of thy mourning,

21. And thy people—they all will be righteous, for ever shall they possess the land, the sprout of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may glorify myself.

22. The little one shall become a thousand, and the small, a mighty nation: I the Lord will hasten it in its time.

## Isaiah 61

1. The Spirit of the Lord Eternal is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to announce good tidings unto the meek: he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim to captives Liberty, and to prisoners Release;

2. To proclaim a year of favor of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all mourners;

3. To grant unto the mourners of Zion,—to give unto them ornament in the place of ashes, oil of gladness in the place of mourning, garments of praise in the place of a grieved spirit; that they may be called, Oaks of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he may be glorified.

4. And they shall build up the ancient ruins, desolate places of former times shall they raise up, and they shall renew ruined cities, the desolate places of many generations.

5. And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your ploughmen and your vintners.

6. But ye, ye shall be called, Priests of the Lord; Ministers of our God, shall be said unto you: the wealth of nations shall ye consume, and in their glory shall ye be placed as possessors.

7. In the place of your twofold shame,—and the confusion of which they loudly complained as their portion: therefore in their land shall they possess a twofold portion; everlasting joy shall be granted unto them.

8. For I the Lord love justice, I hate robbery with burnt-offering: therefore will I give them the recompense of their work in truth, and an everlasting covenant will I make with them.

9. And among the nations shall their seed be known, and their offspring in the midst of the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed whom the Lord hath blessed.

10. I will be greatly glad in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, with the mantle of righteousness hath he enveloped me, as a bridegroom decketh himself with elegant attire, and as a bride adorneth herself with her bridal array.

11. For, as the earth bringeth forth her growth, and as a garden causeth what is sown therein to spring forth: thus will the Lord Eternal cause righteousness and praise to spring forth in the presence of all the nations.

## Isaiah 62

1. For the sake of Zion will I not be silent, and for the sake of Jerusalem will I not be quiet; until its righteousness go forth as the brightness of light, and its salvation as a burning torch.

2. And nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory; and men shall call thee by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall pronounce.

3. And thou shalt be a crown of ornament in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.

4. Thou shalt not be termed any more "Forsaken," and thy land shall not be termed any more "Desolate;" for thou shalt be called "My delight in her" [Chephzi-bah] , and thy land "Espoused" [Be’ulah] ; for the Lord will have delight in thee, and thy land shall be espoused.

5. For as a young man espouseth a virgin, so shall thy sons espouse thee; and as the bridegroom is glad over the bride, so will be glad over thee thy God.

6. Over thy walls, O Jerusalem, have I appointed watchmen, all the day and all the night, continually, shall they not be silent: ye that make mention of the Lord, take ye no rest.

7. And give him no rest, until he have established, and until he have set up Jerusalem as a praise on the earth.

8. Sworn hath the Lord by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, I will not give thy corn any more as food for thy enemies, and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy young wine for which thou hast labored;

9. But they who gather it shall eat it, and praise the Lord; and they who bring it together shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.

10. Pass, pass through the gates, make clear the way of the people, cast up, cast up the highway, remove away the stones, lift up a banner over the nations.

11. Behold, the Lord hath caused to be heard unto the ends of the earth, "Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold his reward is with him, and his recompense before him."

12. And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the Lord; and thou shalt be called, Sought for, [Derusha,] The city never forsaken.

## Isaiah 63

1. Who is this that cometh from Edom, dyed red in his garments from Bozrah? this—glorious in his apparel, moving along in the greatness of his strength? "I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save."

2. Why is redness on thy apparel, and why are thy garments as of one that treadeth the wine-press?

3. "I have trodden the vat alone, and of the nations there was no man with me; and I trod them down in my anger, and I trampled on them in my fury; and their blood was sprinkled on my garments, and all my raiments have I stained.

4. For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemed was come.

5. And I looked, and there was no one to help, and I was astonished, and there was no one to support; and then my own arm aided me, and my fury—this it was that upheld me.

6. And I stamped down nations in my anger, and I made them drunken with my fury, and brought down to the earth their victorious strength."

7. The kindnesses of the Lord will I mention, the praises of the Lord, in accordance with all that the Lord hath bestowed on us, and the abundant goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and the abundance of his kindnesses.

8. And he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie; and he became to them a Saviour.

9. In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them; in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them, and he carried them all the days of old.

10. But they rebelled, and grieved his holy Spirit; and he changed himself to become their enemy, and he fought against them.

11. Then remembered his people the ancient days of Moses, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put within him his holy Spirit?

12. That displayed by the right hand of Moses his glorious arm; that divided the water before them, to make unto himself an everlasting name?

13. That led them through the deeps, as a horse through the wilderness, that they should not stumble?

14. As a beast goeth down into the valley, so did the spirit of the Lord bring them to rest; thus didst thou guide thy people, to make unto thyself a glorious name.

15. Look down from heaven, and behold, from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where are thy zeal and thy mights, the yearning of thy bowels and of thy mercy which are now restrained from me?

16. For thou art our father; for Abraham knoweth nothing of us, and Israel recogniseth us not: thou, O Lord, art our father, our Redeemer from everlasting is thy name.

17. Why hast thou let us go astray, O Lord, from thy ways, suffered our heart to be hardened against thy fear? Return for the sake of thy servants, the tribes of thy heritage.

18. But a brief space were thy holy people in possession, when our adversaries trod down thy sanctuary.

19. We are become as though we are those over whom thou hast never ruled, over whom thy name hath not been called. Oh that thou mightest rend the heavens, come down: at thy presence would mountains then melt away.

## Isaiah 64

1. As fire is kindled on brushwood, as water is made to bubble up by fire—to make thy name known to thy adversaries, that at thy presence nations might tremble!

2. As when thou didst fearful deeds which we had not looked for, thou camest down, while at thy presence mountains melted away;

3. Yea! what from the beginning of the world men had not heard, not perceived by their hearing; no eye also had seen a god beside thee, who could do the like for the one that waiteth for him.

4. Thou acceptest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou wast wroth, for we had sinned on them continually; and can we thus be saved?

5. And we are become like an unclean man all of us, and like a soiled garment, all our righteousness; and we wither like a leaf all of us; and our iniquities, like the wind, will bear us away.

6. And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth himself up to lay hold of thee; for thou hast hidden thy face from us, and hast let us melt away, through the force of our iniquities.

7. But now, O Lord, our father art thou; we are the clay, and thou our fashioner; and the work of thy hand are we all.

8. Be not wroth, O Lord, so very greatly, and do not for ever remember our iniquity: behold, look, we beseech thee, thy people are we all.

9. Thy holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem, a desolate place.

10. Our holy and beautiful house where our fathers praised thee, is burnt up with fire; and all our costly things are become ruins.

11. Wilt thou for these things refrain thyself, O Lord? wilt thou be silent, and afflict us so very greatly?

## Isaiah 65

1. I allowed myself to be sought by those that asked not; I let myself be found by those that sought me not: I said, Here am I, here am I, unto a nation that called itself not by my name.

2. I spread out my hands all the time unto a rebellious people, that walk in the way which is not good, after their own thoughts;

3. To the people that provoke me to anger to my face continually; that sacrifice in gardens and burn incense upon altars of brick,

4. That sit about among the graves, and lodge in the vaults, that eat the flesh of the swine, and have broth of abominations in their vessels;

5. That say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the time.

6. Behold, it is written before me; I will not keep silence, till I have recompensed, yea, recompensed into their bosom.—

7. Your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the Lord, who have burnt incense upon the mountains, and upon the hills have blasphemed me: and I will measure out their work at first into their bosom.

8. Thus hath said the Lord, As the new wine is found in the cluster of grapes, and one saith, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it; so will I do for the sake of my servants, that I will not destroy the whole;

9. And I let come forth out of Jacob a seed, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.

10. And Sharon shall become a fold of flocks, and the valley of ‘Achor a resting-place for herds, for my people that have sought me.

11. But ye who forsake the Lord, who forget my holy mountain, that set out a table for the god of Fortune, and that fill for Destiny the drink-offering.—

12. Yea, I will destine you to the sword, and all of you shall kneel down to the slaughter; because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spoke, ye did not hear; but ye did what is evil in my eyes, and that wherein I had no delight did ye choose.

13. Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be made ashamed;

14. Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry out from pain of heart, and from a broken spirit shall ye howl;

15. And ye shall leave behind your name for an oath unto my elect ones, when the Lord Eternal will slay thee; but his servants will he call by another name.

16. Whoever there be that blesseth himself on the earth shall bless himself by the true God; and that sweareth on the earth shall swear by the true God; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hidden from my eyes.

17. For, behold, I will create new heavens and a new earth; and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind;

18. But be ye glad and rejoice unto all eternity in what I create; for, behold, I will create Jerusalem for rejoicing, and her people for gladness.

19. And I will rejoice over Jerusalem, and be glad in my people: and there shall not be heard in her any more the voice of weeping, nor the voice of complaint.

20. There shall no more come thence an infant of few days, nor an old man that shall not have the full length of his days; for as a lad shall one die a hundred years old; and as a sinner shall be accursed he who dieth at a hundred years old.

21. And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.

22. They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat; for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and the work of their hands shall my elect wear out.

23. They shall not toil in vain, nor bring forth unto an early death; for the seed of the blessed of the Lord are they, and their offspring with them.

24. And it shall come to pass, that before yet they call will I answer; and while they are still speaking will I hear.

25. The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall like the bullock eat straw: and the serpent—dust shall be his food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord.

## Isaiah 66

1. Thus hath said the Lord, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is there a house that ye can build unto me? and where is the place of my rest?

2. For all these things hath my hand made, that all these things came into being, saith the Lord; but upon such a one will I look, upon the poor, and him who is of a contrite spirit, and who trembleth at my word.

3. He that slaughtereth the ox, slayeth a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, breaketh the neck of a dog; he that offereth a meat-offering, offereth swine’s blood; he that burneth incense, blesseth an idol: yea, they have made choice of their own ways, and in their abominations doth their soul delight.

4. So will I also make choice of their misfortune, and what they dread will I bring upon them; because I called, and none did answer; I spoke, and they did not hear; and they did what is evil in my eyes, and that in which I delighted not did they choose.

5. Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word: Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for the sake of my name, said, "Let the Lord be glorified;" but he will appear to your joy, and they shall be made ashamed.

6. There is a voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple, the voice of the Lord who rendereth recompense to his enemies.

7. Before she had travailed she brought forth; before yet her pain was come, she was delivered of a man-child.

8. Who hath heard the like? who hath seen such things? shall a land be made to travail in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? that Zion hath travailed, also brought forth her children?

9. Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the Lord; or shall I who cause to bring forth, now prevent it? saith thy God.

10. Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be delighted over her, all ye that love her; be highly glad with her, all ye that mourn for her.

11. In order that ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breast of her consolations; in order that ye may sip, and find pleasure from the abundance of her glory.

12. For thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will extend to her peace like a river, and like a rapid stream the glory of nations, that ye may suck: upon the arm shall ye be borne, and upon knees shall ye be dandled.

13. As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and in Jerusalem shall ye be comforted.

14. And ye shall see this, and your heart shall be glad, and your bones shall flourish like the grass; and then will be known the hand of the Lord on his servants, and he will be indignant toward his enemies.

15. For, behold, the Lord will come with fire, and his chariots will be like the storm-wind, to send forth his anger with fury, and his threatening with flames of fire.

16. For by fire will the Lord judge, and by his sword against all flesh: and many shall be the slain of the Lord.

17. They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves for the gardens, behind one tree in the midst, they who eat the flesh of the swine, and the abomination, and the mouse, together shall they perish, saith the Lord.

18. And I, because of their works and their thoughts, will let it come to pass to gather all the nations and tongues; and they shall come, and shall see my glory.

19. And I will display a sign on them, and I will send from them those that escape unto the nations, Tharshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, Thubal, and Javan, the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, and have not seen my glory; and they shall proclaim my glory among the nations.

20. And they shall bring all your brethren out of all nations as an offering unto the Lord, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the Lord, as the children of Israel bring the offering in a clean vessel into the house of the Lord.

21. And of them also will I take for priests and for Levites, saith the Lord.

22. For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall have permanence before me, saith the Lord, so shall exist permanently your seed and your name.

23. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to the other new moon, and from one sabbath to the other sabbath, shall all flesh come to prostrate themselves before me, saith the Lord.

24. And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me; for their worm shall not die, nor shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorrence unto all flesh.
