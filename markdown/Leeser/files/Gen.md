# Genesis

## Genesis 1

1. In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

2. And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God was waving over the face of the waters.

3. And God said, Let there be light; and there was light.

4. And God saw the light that it was good; and God divided between the light and the darkness.

5. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And it was evening and it was morning, the first day.

6. And God said, Let there be an expansion in the midst of the waters, and let it divide between waters and waters.

7. And God made the expansion, and divided between the waters which were under the expansion and the waters which were above the expansion: and it was so.

8. And God called the expansion Heaven. And it was evening and it was morning, the second day.

9. And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land be visible: and it was so.

10. And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas: and God saw that it was good.

11. And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, herbs yielding seed, fruit-trees yielding fruit after their kind, in which its seed is upon the earth: and it was so.

12. And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees yielding fruit, in which its seed is after their kind: and God saw that it was good.

13. And it was evening and it was morning, the third day.

14. And God said, Let there be lights in the expansion of the heaven to divide between the day and the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years;

15. And let them be for lights in the expansion of the heaven, to give light upon the earth: and it was so.

16. And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; and the stars.

17. And God set them in the expansion of the heaven to give light upon the earth,

18. And to rule by day and by night, and to divide between the light and the darkness: and God saw that it was good.

19. And it was evening and it was morning, the fourth day.

20. And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly moving creatures that have life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open expansion of the heaven.

21. And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every winged fowl after its kind: and God saw that it was good.

22. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the fowl multiply on the earth.

23. And it was evening and it was morning, the fifth day.

24. And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so.

25. And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind: and God saw that it was good.

26. And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and they shall have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heaven, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

27. And God created man in his image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.

28. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heaven, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

29. And God said, Behold I have given unto you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree on which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food.

30. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the heaven, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for food: and it was so.

31. And God saw every thing that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And it was evening and it was morning, the sixth day.

## Genesis 2

1. Thus were finished the heavens and the earth, and all their host.

2. And God had finished on the seventh day his work which he had made, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.

3. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because thereon he had rested from all his work which God had created in making it.

4. These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, on the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven.

5. And every plant of the field was not yet on the earth, and every herb of the field had not yet grown; for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and man was not yet there to till the ground.

6. But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.

7. And the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being.

8. And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden to the eastward, and he put there the man whom he had formed.

9. And the Lord God caused to grow out of the ground every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food; and the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

10. And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it was parted, and became four principal streams.

11. The name of the first is Pishon, the same which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.

12. And the gold of that land is good; there is the bdellium and the onyx stone.

13. And the name of the second river is Gihon, the same which compasseth the whole land of Cush.

14. And the name of the third river is Hiddekel, the same which floweth towards the east of Assyria; and the fourth river is the Euphrates.

15. And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to till it, and to keep it.

16. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat;

17. But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for on the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.

18. And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help suitable for him.

19. And the Lord God had formed out of the ground every beast of the field, and every fowl of the heaven, and he brought them unto the man to see what he would call them; and whatsoever the man would call every living creature, that should be its name.

20. And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the heaven, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found a help suitable for him.

21. And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof.

22. And the Lord God formed the rib which he had taken from the man into a woman, and brought her unto the man.

23. And the man said, This time it is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; this shall be called Woman, [Ishah,] because out of Man [Ishi] was this one taken.

24. Therefore doth a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave unto his wife, and they become one flesh.

25. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.

## Genesis 3

1. Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made; and he said unto the woman, Hath God indeed said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

2. And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden;

3. But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.

4. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye will surely not die;

5. For God doth know, that, on the day ye eat thereof, your eyes will be opened, and ye will be as God, knowing good and evil.

6. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.

7. And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they felt that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons.

8. And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day; and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.

9. And the Lord God called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou?

10. And he said, Thy voice I heard in the garden; and I was afraid, because I am naked; and I hid myself.

11. And he said, Who told thee that thou art naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?

12. And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.

13. And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.

14. And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, be thou cursed above all the cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:

15. And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt wound his heel.

16. Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and the suffering of thy conception; in pain shalt thou bring forth children; and for thy husband shall be thy desire, but he shall rule over thee.

17. And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it; cursed be the ground for thy sake; in pain shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.

18. And thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herbs of the field.

19. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground, for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.

20. And the man called his wife’s name Eve [Chavvah] ; because she was the mother of all living [Chay].

21. And the Lord God made unto Adam and to his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.

22. And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever—

23. Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.

24. So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flaming sword which revolveth, to guard the way to the tree of life.

## Genesis 4

1. And the man knew Eve his wife: and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord.

2. And she bore again, his brother, Abel; and Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

3. And it came to pass in process of time, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord.

4. And Abel—he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fattest thereof; and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering;

5. But unto Cain and to his offering he had no respect; and it was very displeasing to Cain, and his countenance fell.

6. And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?

7. If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door; and unto thee is its desire, but thou canst rule over it.

8. And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.

9. And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel they brother? and he said, I know not; am I my brother’s keeper?

10. And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.

11. And now be thou cursed from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand:

12. When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield its strength unto thee; fugitive and vagabond shalt thou be on the earth.

13. And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment is greater than I can bear.

14. Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and if I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, it will come to pass, that every one that findeth me will slay me.

15. And the Lord said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him seven-fold. And the Lord set a sign unto Cain, that any one finding him should not kill him.

16. And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

17. And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bore Enoch; and he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.

18. And unto Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begat Mechujael: and Mechujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lemech.

19. And Lemech took unto himself two wives, the name of one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.

20. And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and have cattle.

21. And his brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all such as play on the harp and guitar.

22. And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain, an artificer in every article of copper and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.

23. And Lemech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; ye wives of Lemech, hearken unto my speech; for I have slain a man to my own wounding, and a young-man to my hurt.

24. If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold, truly Lemech seventy and seven-fold.

25. And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Sheth [Seth] ; for God said she hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.

26. And to Sheth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh: then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.

## Genesis 5

1. This is the book of the generations of Adam. On the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him:

2. Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, on the day when they were created.

3. And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his likeness, after his image; and called his name Sheth.

4. And the days of Adam after he had begotten Sheth were eight hundred years; and he begat sons and daughters.

5. And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years; and he died.

6. And Sheth lived a hundred and five years, and begat Enosh.

7. And Sheth lived after he had begotten Enosh eight hundred and seven years; and he begat sons and daughters.

8. And all the days of Sheth were nine hundred and twelve years; and he died.

9. And Enosh lived ninety years, and begat Kenan.

10. And Enosh lived after he had begotten Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years; and he begat sons and daughters.

11. And all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years; and he died.

12. And Kenan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalalel.

13. And Kenan lived after he had begotten Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years; and he begat sons and daughters

14. And all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.

15. And Mahalalel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared.

16. And Mahalalel lived after he had begotten Jared eight hundred and thirty years; and he begat sons and daughters.

17. And all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety and five years; and he died.

18. And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years, and begat Enoch.

19. And Jared lived after he had begotten Enoch eight hundred years; and he begat sons and daughters.

20. And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years; and he died.

21. And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methushelah.

22. And Enoch walked with God after he had begotten Methushelah three hundred years; and begat sons and daughters.

23. And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years.

24. And Enoch walked with God, and he was no more; for God had taken him.

25. And Methushelah lived a hundred eighty and seven years and begat Lemech.

26. And Methushelah lived after he had begotten Lemech seven hundred eighty and two years; and he begat sons and daughters.

27. And all the days of Methushelah were nine hundred sixty and nine years; and he died.

28. And Lemech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son.

29. And he called his name Noach, [Noah,] saying, This one shall comfort us concerning our work and the toil of our hands, because of the ground which the Lord hath cursed.

30. And Lemech lived after he had begotten Noah five hundred ninety and five years; and begat sons and daughters.

31. And all the days of Lemech were seven hundred seventy and seven years; and he died.

32. And Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

## Genesis 6

1. And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,

2. That the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were fair; and they took themselves wives of all whom they chose.

3. And the Lord said, My Spirit shall not always strive for the sake of man, for that he is but flesh; yet his days of grace shall be a hundred and twenty years.

4. The giants were on the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bore children to them; these became the mighty men, who were of old the men of renown.

5. And God saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.

6. And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.

7. And the Lord said, I will destroy the man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man and beast, and the creeping things and the fowls of the heaven; for it repenteth me that I have made them.

8. But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.

9. These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just, perfect man in his generation; Noah walked with God.

10. And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

11. And the earth was corrupt before God; and the earth was filled with violence.

12. And God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.

13. And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them, and I will destroy them with the earth.

14. Make thee an ark of gopher-wood, rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

15. And this is the manner in which thou shalt make it: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.

16. A window shalt thou make to the ark, and thou shalt finish it above, to be one cubit broad, and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.

17. And as regards myself, behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under the heavens; every thing that is on the earth shall perish.

18. But I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives with thee.

19. And of every living thing, of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee: male and female shall they be.

20. Of the fowls after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.

21. And thou, for thy part, take unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be unto thee, and unto them for food.

22. Thus did Noah; according to all that God had commanded him, so he did.

## Genesis 7

1. And the Lord said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy household into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.

2. Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven pairs of each, the male and his female; and of beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female.

3. Also of the fowls of the heaven, seven pairs of each, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.

4. For after only seven days more, I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights: and I will blot out every living substance that I have made from off the face of the earth.

5. And Noah did all just as the Lord had commanded him.

6. And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.

7. And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.

8. Of the clean beasts, and of the beasts that are not clean, and of the fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,

9. One pair of each went in unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.

10. And it came to pass, after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.

11. In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on this same day, were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.

12. And the rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

13. On that self-same day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;

14. They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird, every thing that hath wings.

15. And they went in unto Noah into the ark, one pair of each, of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.

16. And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and then the Lord shut him in.

17. And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth.

18. And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark floated along upon the face of the waters.

19. And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high mountains that are under the whole heavens were covered.

20. Fifteen cubits above them did the waters prevail; and the mountains were thus covered.

21. And all flesh perished that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man.

22. All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that were on the dry land, died.

23. And it swept off every living substance which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping things, and fowls of the heaven; and they were swept from the earth; and Noah only was left, together with those that were with him in the ark.

24. And the waters prevailed upon the earth one hundred and fifty days.

## Genesis 8

1. And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters were assuaged;

2. The fountains also of the deep, and the windows of heaven were stopped; and the rain from heaven was restrained.

3. And the waters returned from off the earth, gradually returning; and the waters were abated after the end of the hundred and fifty days.

4. And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.

5. And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen;

6. And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made;

7. And he sent forth a raven which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.

8. He then sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground.

9. But the dove found no resting-place for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him unto the ark; for there was water on the face of the whole earth; then he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her into the ark.

10. And he stayed yet another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark.

11. And the dove came in to him at the time of the evening; and, lo, an olive-leaf plucked off was in her mouth; so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.

12. And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; but she returned not again unto him any more.

13. And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, that the waters were dried up from off the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.

14. And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth perfectly dried up.

15. And God spoke unto Noah, saying,

16. Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee.

17. Every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, bring forth with thee; that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.

18. And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him.

19. Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their families, went forth out of the ark.

20. And Noah built an altar unto the Lord, and he took of every clean cattle, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.

21. And the Lord smelled the sweet savour; and the Lord said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for the sake of man; although the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth: neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.

22. All the while the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease.

## Genesis 9

1. And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.

2. And the fear of you, and the dread of you, shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the heaven; whatever is that moveth upon the earth, and all the fishes of the sea, are delivered into your hand.

3. Every moving thing that liveth shall be yours for food; even as the green herbs have I given you all things.

4. But flesh in which its life is, which is its blood, shall ye not eat.

5. Your blood, however, on which your lives depend, will I require: at the hand of every beast will I require it; and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man’s brother will I require the life of man.

6. Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God made he man.

7. And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly on the earth, and multiply thereon.

8. And God spoke unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

9. And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;

10. And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you, from all those that go out of the ark, for every beast of the earth.

11. And I will establish my covenant with you; and all flesh shall not be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there be any more a flood to destroy the earth.

12. And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you, and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations.

13. My bow I do set in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of the covenant between me and the earth.

14. And it shall come to pass, that, when I bring a cloud over the earth, and the bow shall be seen in the cloud,

15. I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

16. And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature, of all flesh, that is upon the earth.

17. And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.

18. And the sons of Noah that went forth from the ark, were Shem, Ham and Japheth; and Ham was the father of Canaan.

19. These three were the sons of Noah, and of them was the whole earth overspread.

20. And Noah, who was a husbandman, began his work, and he planted a vineyard.

21. And he drank of the wine, and became drunken; and he uncovered himself within his tent.

22. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told it his two brothers without.

23. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon the shoulders of both of them, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were turned backward, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.

24. And Noah awoke from his wine, and discovered what his younger son had done unto him.

25. And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.

26. And he said, Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem; and Canaan shall be a servant unto them.

27. May God enlarge the boundaries of Japheth, and may he dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be a servant unto them.

28. And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

29. And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.

## Genesis 10

1. Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and unto them were sons born after the flood.

2. The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tirass.

3. And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.

4. And Javan’s sons: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.

5. From these were separated the isles of the nations in their lands, every one after his tongue: after their families, in their nations.

6. And the sons of Ham: Cush and Mizrayim, Put and Canaan.

7. And the sons of Cush: Seba and Havilah, Sabtah and Raamah, and Sabtecha; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.

8. And Cush begat Nimrod; he began to be a mighty man on the earth.

9. He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord.

10. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

11. Out of that land went forth Asshur, and built Nineveh, and the city of Rechoboth, and Calach.

12. And Ressen between Nineveh and Calach: the same is the great city.

13. And Mizrayim begat the Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuchim.

14. And the Pethrussim, and Casluchin, out of whom came the Pelishtim, and the Caphtorim.

15. And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth,

16. And the Jebusite, and the Emorite, and the Girgashite,

17. And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,

18. And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.

19. And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gazzah; as thou goest unto Sodom and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboyim, even unto Lesha.

20. These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, in their nations.

21. But unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, were children born.

22. The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram.

23. And the children of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

24. And Arpachshad begat Shelach; and Shelach begat Eber.

25. And unto Eber were born two sons; the name of one was Peleg, for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan.

26. And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerach,

27. And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,

28. And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba.

29. And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.

30. And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar, the mount of the east.

31. These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.

32. These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations; and from these were the nations separated on the earth after the flood.

## Genesis 11

1. And the whole earth was of one language, and of one kind of words.

2. And it came to pass, as they journeyed toward the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there.

3. And they said to one another, Go to, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly. And thus the brick served them for stone, and slime served them for mortar.

4. And they said, Go to, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower, the top of which may reach unto heaven; and let us make ourselves a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

5. And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man were building.

6. And the Lord said, Behold, it is one people, and they have all one language, and this is the first thing they undertake to do; and now shall they not be restrained in all which they have imagined to do?

7. Go to, let us go down, and confound there their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.

8. So the Lord scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth; and they left off to build the city.

9. Therefore is the name of it called Babel, because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth; and from there did the Lord scatter them abroad over the face of all the earth.

10. These are the generations of Shem: Shem, when a hundred years old, begat Arpachshad, two years after the flood.

11. And Shem lived after he had begotten Arpachshad five hundred years; and begat sons and daughters.

12. And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelach.

13. And Arpachshad lived after he had begotten Shelach four hundred and three years; and begat sons and daughters.

14. And Shelach lived thirty years, and begat Eber.

15. And Shelach lived after he had begotten Eber four hundred and three years; and begat sons and daughters.

16. And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg.

17. And Eber lived after he had begotten Peleg four hundred and thirty years; and begat sons and daughters.

18. And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu.

19. And Peleg lived after he had begotten Reu two hundred and nine years; and begat sons and daughters.

20. And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug.

21. And Reu lived after he had begotten Serug two hundred and seven years; and begat sons and daughters.

22. And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nachor.

23. And Serug lived after he had begotten Nachor two hundred years; and begat sons and daughters.

24. And Nachor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terach.

25. And Nachor lived after he had begotten Terach a hundred and nineteen years; and begat sons and daughters.

26. And Terach lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nachor, and Haran.

27. Now these are the generations of Terach: Terach begat Abram, Nachor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

28. And Haran died before his father Terach in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

29. And Abram and Nachor took themselves wives; the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nachor’s wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Yiscah.

30. But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

31. And Terach took Abram his son, and Lot, the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, the wife of his son Abram; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Charan, and dwelt there.

32. And the days of Terach were two hundred and five years; and Terach died in Charan.

## Genesis 12

1. Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and out of thy birthplace, and from thy father’s house, unto the land that I will show thee.

2. And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:

3. And I will bless those that bless thee, and him that curseth thee, will I curse; and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.

4. So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him, and Lot went with him; and Abram was seventy and five years old at his departure out of Charan.

5. And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had acquired, and the persons that they had obtained in Charan; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and they came into the land of Canaan.

6. And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh; and the Canaanite was then in the land.

7. And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land. And he built there an altar unto the Lord, who had appeared unto him.

8. And he removed from there unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and ‘Ai on the east; and he built there an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.

9. And Abram journeyed farther, still going on toward the south.

10. And there arose a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.

11. And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a woman of handsome appearance:

12. And it may come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This is his wife; and they may kill me, but thee they will save alive.

13. Say then, I pray thee, thou art my sister, that it may go well with me for thy sake, and my soul live because of thee.

14. And it came to pass, when Abram was come into Egypt, that the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.

15. The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.

16. And he did well to Abram for her sake; and he received sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.

17. But the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.

18. And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this thou hast done unto me? Why didst thou not tell me that she is thy wife?

19. Why saidst thou, She is my sister? and so I took her to me for a wife; now, therefore, behold, here is thy wife, take her, and go thy way.

20. And Pharaoh commanded some men concerning him, who accompanied him and his wife, and all that he had.

## Genesis 13

1. And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.

2. And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

3. And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and ‘Ai;

4. Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first; and Abram called there on the name of the Lord.

5. And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.

6. And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together; for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.

7. And there arose a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle, and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle; and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.

8. And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we are near relatives.

9. Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right, then I will go to the left.

10. And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere; before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, it was like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, till thou comest unto Zoar.

11. Then Lot chose himself all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east; and they separated themselves the one from the other.

12. Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan; and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tents, till close to Sodom.

13. But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.

14. And the Lord said unto Abram, after Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thy eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward;

15. For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever.

16. And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth; so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.

17. Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for unto thee will I give it.

18. Then Abram pitched his tent, and came and dwelt in the grove of Mamre, which is in Hebron; and he built there an altar unto the Lord.

## Genesis 14

1. And it came to pass, in the day of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goyim;

2. That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboyim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.

3. All these joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is now the salt sea.

4. Twelve years had they served Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.

5. And in the fourteenth year came Kedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and they smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnayim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathayim,

6. And the Horites in their mountain Seir, unto El-paran, which is by the wilderness.

7. And they returned and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Emorites, that dwelt in Hazezon-tamar.

8. And then went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboyim, and the king of Bela, the same is Zoar; and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;

9. With Kedorlaomer king of Elam, and with Tidal king of Goyim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.

10. And the vale of Siddim was full of slime-pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell therein; and they that remained fled to the mountain.

11. And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.

12. And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.

13. And there came one that had escaped, and told it to Abram the Hebrew; but he dwelt in the grove of Mamre the Emorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner, and these were confederates of Abram.

14. And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants; born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them into Dan.

15. And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.

16. And he brought back all the goods; and he also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and also the women, and the people.

17. And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from smiting Kedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him at the valley of Shaveh, which is the kings’ dale.

18. And Malkizidek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine; and he was a priest of the most high God.

19. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth.

20. And blessed he the most high God, who hath delivered thy enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

21. And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and the goods take to thyself.

22. And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,

23. That I will not take from a thread even to a shoe-latchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine; lest thou shouldst say, I have made Abram rich:

24. Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre—these may take their portion.

## Genesis 15

1. After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not Abram; I am thy shield, thy reward shall be exceedingly great.

2. And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?

3. And Abram said, Behold to me thou hast given no seed; and lo, one born in my house will be my heir.

4. And behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This one shall not be thy heir; but he that shall come forth out of thy own bowels shall be thy heir.

5. And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward the heaven, and count the stars, if thou be able to count them; and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.

6. And he believed in the Lord; and he accounted it to him for righteousness.

7. And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give unto thee this land, to inherit it.

8. And he said, Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?

9. And he said unto him, Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.

10. And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one opposite the other; but the birds he did not divide.

11. And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses; but Abram drove them away.

12. And when the sun was about going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and lo, a horror, dark and great, fell upon him.

13. And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land which is not theirs, and they will make them serve, and they will afflict them four hundred years.

14. And also that nation whom they shall serve, will I judge; and afterward shall they go out with great substance.

15. But thou shalt come to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.

16. Yet the fourth generation shall come hither again; for the iniquity of the Emorites will not be full until then.

17. And it came to pass, when the sun had gone down, and it was dark, that behold a smoking furnace, and a burning flame, which passed between those pieces.

18. On the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates;

19. The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,

20. And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaim,

21. And the Emorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.

## Genesis 16

1. Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, bore him no children; and she had an Egyptian handmaid, whose name was Hagar.

2. And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: go in, I pray thee, unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

3. And Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar, the Egyptian, her maid, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.

4. And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress became of little esteem in her eyes.

5. And Sarai said unto Abram, I suffer wrong through thee; I have placed my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I became of little esteem in her eyes; may the Lord judge between me and thee.

6. But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.

7. And an angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain on the way to Shur.

8. And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, From the face of my mistress Sarai I am fleeing.

9. And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.

10. And the angel of the Lord said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

11. And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and wilt bear a son, and thou shalt call his name Ishmael; because the Lord hath heard thy affliction.

12. And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man’s hand against him; and in the presence of all his brethren shall he dwell.

13. And she called the name of the Lord that spoke unto her, Thou art an all-seeing God; for she said, Have I not also seen here a vision after he appeared to me?

14. Wherefore the well was called Beerlachai-roi: behold, it is between Kadesh and Bared.

15. And Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.

16. And Abram was eighty and six years old, when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.

## Genesis 17

1. And when Abram was ninety and nine years old, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God: walk before me, and be thou perfect.

2. And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and I will multiply thee exceedingly.

3. And Abram fell on his face, and God spoke with him, saying,

4. As for me, behold my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt become the father of a multitude of nations.

5. Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for the father of a multitude of nations have I made thee.

6. And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and I will cause thee to become nations; and kings shall come out of thee.

7. And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and between thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant: to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.

8. And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou sojournest, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.

9. And God said unto Abraham, But thou, for thy part, shalt keep my covenant, thou and thy seed after thee, in their generations.

10. This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and between you, and between thy seed after thee: Every man-child among you shall be circumcised.

11. And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and this shall serve as the token of the covenant between me and you.

12. And at eight days old shall every man-child in your generations be circumcised among you, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, who is not of thy seed.

13. He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised; and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.

14. And any uncircumcised male, who circumciseth not the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.

15. And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.

16. And I will bless her, and give thee also a son of her; yea I will bless her, and she shall become a mother of nations; kings of people shall spring from her.

17. Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed; and he said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear?

18. And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!

19. And God said, Truly, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son; and thou shalt call his name Isaac; and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, for his seed after him.

20. And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make of him a great nation.

21. But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.

22. And when he had left off talking with him, God went up from Abraham.

23. And Abraham now took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house; and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on the selfsame day, as God had spoken unto him.

24. And Abraham was ninety and nine years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

25. And Ishmael his son, was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

26. On the self-same day was Abraham circumcised, with Ishmael his son.

27. And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.

## Genesis 18

1. And the Lord appeared unto him in the grove of Mamre; while he was sitting at the door of the tent in the heat of the day.

2. And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and lo, three men stood near him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the door of the tent, and bowed himself to the ground;

3. And he said, My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy eyes, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant.

4. Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.

5. And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your heart, after that ye may pass on; since ye have once passed by your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast spoken.

6. And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.

7. And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man, and he hastened to dress it.

8. And he took cream and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.

9. And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife! And he said, Behold, in the tent.

10. And he said, I will certainly return unto thee at this time next year: and lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it at the door of the tent, which was behind him.

11. Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in years; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

12. Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord also being old!

13. And the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, since I am old?

14. Is anything too hard for the Lord? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, at this time next year, and Sarah shall have a son.

15. Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid; but he said, Nay; indeed thou didst laugh.

16. And the men rose up from there and looked toward Sodom; and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.

17. And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about doing?

18. Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?

19. For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, that they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousness and justice; in order that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken concerning him.

20. And the Lord said, Because the cry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous:

21. I will go down now, and see if they have done according to the cry against them, which is come unto me, destruction shall come upon them; and if not, I will know it.

22. And the men turned their faces from there, and went toward Sodom; but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.

23. And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou then destroy the righteous also with the wicked?

24. Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city; wilt thou then also destroy and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous that are therein?

25. Far be it from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous should be as the wicked; far be this from thee; shall the Judge of all the earth not exercise justice?

26. And the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then will I spare all of the place for their sake.

27. And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, although I am but dust and ashes:

28. Peradventure there will lack five of the fifty righteous; wilt thou then destroy all the city for the lack of these five? And he said, I will not destroy, if I find there forty and five.

29. And he spoke yet again unto him, and said, Peradventure there will be found there forty. And he said, I will not do it for the sake of the forty.

30. And he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there will be found there thirty. And he said, I will not do it, if I find there thirty.

31. And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there will be found there twenty. And he said, I will not destroy for the sake of the twenty.

32. And he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure there will be found there ten. And he said, I will not destroy, for the sake of the ten.

33. And the Lord went away, when he had finished speaking with Abraham; and Abraham returned unto his place.

## Genesis 19

1. And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom; and when Lot saw them he rose up to meet them, and he bowed himself with his face to the ground.

2. And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant’s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye can rise up early, and go on your way. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.

3. And he pressed upon them greatly, and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they did eat.

4. But before they had lain down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:

5. And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men who came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.

6. And Lot went out unto them, at the entrance of the house, and shut the door after him.

7. And he said, I pray you, my brethren, do not act wickedly.

8. Behold now, I have two daughters who have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes, only unto these men do nothing, since they have once come under the shadow of my roof.

9. And they said, Stand back. And they said, This one man came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge; now will we deal worse with thee than with them. And they pressed sorely upon the man Lot, and they came near to break the door.

10. But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot to them into the house, and the door they locked.

11. And the men that were at the entrance of the house they smote with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the entrance.

12. And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? a son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring out of this place.

13. For we will destroy this place, because the cry against them is waxed great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.

14. And Lot went out and spoke unto his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, and said, Arise, get yourselves out of this place, for the Lord will destroy this city; but he seemed as one that jesteth in the eyes of his sons-in-law.

15. And as the morning dawn arose, the angels urged Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters that are here, lest thou be consumed for the iniquity of the city.

16. And while he yet lingered, the men laid hold of his hand, and of the hand of his wife, and of the hand of his two daughters, because the Lord desired to spare him; and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.

17. And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life, look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.

18. And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my lord!

19. Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy eyes, and thou hast magnified thy kindness, which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest the evil overtake me, and I die.

20. Behold now, this city is near to flee thereunto, and it is little; oh, let me, I pray thee, escape thither, as it is but little, that my life may be saved.

21. And he said unto him, See, I have favored thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, of which thou hast spoken.

22. Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou hast come thither. Therefore was the name of the city called Zoar.

23. The sun rose over the earth, when Lot entered into Zoar.

24. And the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire, from the Lord, out of heaven;

25. And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.

26. But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.

27. And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the Lord:

28. And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and lo, smoke went up from the earth as the smoke of a furnace.

29. And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot away out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had dwelt.

30. And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him, for he feared to dwell in Zoar; and he dwelt in a cave, he, and his two daughters.

31. And the first-born said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the country to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:

32. Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

33. And they made their father drink wine that night; and the first-born went in, and lay with her father, and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.

34. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the first-born said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father; let us make him drink wine this night also, and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

35. And they made their father drink wine that night also; and the younger arose, and lay with him, and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.

36. And both the daughters of Lot became with child by their father.

37. And the first-born bore a son, and called his name Moab; the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.

38. And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.

## Genesis 20

1. And Abraham journeyed from there toward the south country, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur and sojourned in Gerar.

2. And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister; and Abimelech the king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.

3. But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou shalt die for the sake of the woman whom thou hast taken; for she is a man’s wife.

4. But Abimelech had not come near to her; and he said, Lord, wilt thou then slay also a righteous nation?

5. Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself, said, He is my brother; in the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have I done this.

6. And God said unto him in the dream, Yea, I also well know that thou hast done this in the integrity of thy heart; therefore did I also withhold thee from sinning against me; for this cause I suffered thee not to touch her.

7. And now restore the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for thee, that thou mayest live; and if thou restore her not, know thou, that thou shalt surety die, thou and all that are thine.

8. And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their hearing; and the men were greatly afraid.

9. Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and in what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? deeds that ought not to be done thou hast done unto me.

10. And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou didst this thing?

11. And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will slay me for the sake of my wife.

12. And yet indeed she is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.

13. And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.

14. And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and men-servants, and women-servants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored to him Sarah his wife.

15. And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it is pleasing in thy eyes.

16. And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, this is to thee a covering of the eyes unto all that are with thee; and with all others thou canst thus justify thyself.

17. And Abraham prayed unto God; and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants, so that they could bear children.

18. For the Lord had fast closed up every womb of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.

## Genesis 21

1. And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken.

2. And Sarah conceived, and bore unto Abraham a son in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him.

3. And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.

4. And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, at eight days old, as God had commanded him.

5. And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.

6. And Sarah said, God hath made me joy, whoever heareth it will laugh concerning me.

7. And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarai should have given children suck? yet I have born a son in his old age.

8. And the child grew, and was weaned; and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.

9. And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had born unto Abraham, mocking.

10. Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bond-woman and her son; for the son of this bond-woman shall not be heir with my son, with Isaac.

11. And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s eyes, because of his son.

12. And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy eyes because of the lad, and because of thy bond-woman; in all that Sarah may say unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.

13. And also of the son of the bond-woman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.

14. And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it onto her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away; and she departed, and wandered astray in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.

15. And the water was spent from the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.

16. And she went, and seated herself down at some distance, a good way off, about a bow-shot; for she said, I cannot look on when the child dieth; so she sat at a distance, and lifted up her voice, and wept.

17. And God heard the voice of the lad; and an angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? Fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad, there where he is.

18. Arise, lift up the lad, and lay hold on him with thy hand; for I will make of him a great nation.

19. And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water: and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.

20. And God was with the lad; and he grew up, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.

21. And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.

22. And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, spoke unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:

23. Now therefore swear unto me here by God, that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son; but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, shalt thou do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.

24. And Abraham said, I will swear.

25. And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.

26. And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me; nor have I heard of it except this day.

27. And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.

28. And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock, by themselves.

29. And Abimelech said unto Abraham; What mean these seven ewe-lambs which thou hast set by themselves?

30. And he said, For these seven ewe-lambs shalt thou take from my hand, that they may be a witness unto me that I have dug this well.

31. Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they swore, both of them.

32. Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba; then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.

33. And Abraham planted an orchard in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the Lord, the God of everlasting.

34. And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.

## Genesis 22

1. And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and he said unto him, Abraham, and he said, Behold, here am I.

2. And he said: Take now thy son, thy only one, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I tell thee of.

3. And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and arose, and went unto the place of which God had told him.

4. On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.

5. And Abraham said unto his young men, abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder, and we will worship, and then come again to you.

6. And Abraham took the wood for the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and they went both of them together.

7. And Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father, and said, My father; and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold, here is the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?

8. And Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son; so they went both of them together.

9. And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built there an altar, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar above the wood.

10. And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.

11. But the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham; and he said, Here am I.

12. And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou the least unto him; for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing that thou hast not withheld thy son, thy only one, from me.

13. And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, there was a ram that was afterward caught in a thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son.

14. And Abraham called the name of that place, Adonai-yireh: as it is said to this day, On the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.

15. And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham the second time out of heaven,

16. And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, since, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thy only one:

17. That I will greatly bless thee, and I will exceedingly multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;

18. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because that thou hast obeyed my voice.

19. And Abraham returned unto his young men; and they rose up, and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt in Beer-sheba.

20. And it came to pass after these things, that it was told to Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also, hath born children unto Nachor thy brother;

21. ‘Uz his first born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,

22. And Kesed, and Chazo, and Pildash, and Yidlaph, and Bethuel.

23. And Bethuel begat Rebekah; these eight did Milcah bear to Nachor, Abraham’s brother.

24. And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bore Tebach, and Gacham, and Thachash, and Maachah.

## Genesis 23

1. And the lifetime of Sarah was a hundred and twenty-seven years; these were the years of the life of Sarah.

2. And Sarah died in Kiryath-arba, the same in Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.

3. And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke unto the sons of Heth, saying,

4. A stranger and a sojourner I am with you; give me a possession for a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.

5. And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him:

6. Hear us, my lord; a prince of God thou art among us; in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, so that thou mayest bury thy dead.

7. And Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, to the children of Heth.

8. And he spoke with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and intercede for me with Ephron the son of Zochar,

9. That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which is his, which is at the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me, for a possession as a burying-place amongst you.

10. And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, and of all those that went in at the gate of his city, saying,

11. Nay, my lord, hear me: the field I give to thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it to thee; in the presence of the sons of my people do I give it to thee; bury thy dead.

12. And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.

13. And he spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wouldst only hear me; I will give the money for the field, take it off me, and I will bury my dead there.

14. And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,

15. My lord, hearken unto me: a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and thee? only bury thy dead.

16. And Abraham understood the meaning of Ephron; and Abraham weighed out to Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current with the merchant.

17. And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all its borders round about, were made sure

18. Unto Abraham for a bought possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.

19. And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre, which is Hebron, in the land of Canaan.

20. And the field, with the cave that is therein, was made sure unto Abraham for a possession as a burying-place by the sons of Heth.

## Genesis 24

1. And Abraham was old, well stricken in years; and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things.

2. And Abraham said unto his servant, the eldest of his house, who ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:

3. And I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.

4. But unto my country, and to my birthplace shalt thou go, and take a wife unto my son, unto Isaac.

5. And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I then bring thy son again unto the land from which thou camest?

6. And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou, that thou bring not my son thither again.

7. The Lord, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my birth, and who spoke unto me, and who swore unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land: he will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from there.

8. But if the woman should not be willing to follow thee, then shalt, thou be clear from this my oath: only my son thou shalt not bring thither again.

9. And the put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.

10. And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed, with all kinds of precious things of his master in his hand; and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nachor.

11. And he made the camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, at the time that the women go out to draw water.

12. And he said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and deal kindly with my master Abraham.

13. Behold, I stand by the well of water: and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water.

14. And let it come to pass that the maiden to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and to thy camels also will I give drink, be the one thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shown kindness unto my master.

15. And it came to pass, before he had yet finished speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, the son of Milcah, the wife of Nachor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.

16. And the maiden was of a very handsome appearance, a virgin, neither had any man known her; and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.

17. And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water out of thy pitcher.

18. And she said, Drink, my lord; and she hastened, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him to drink.

19. And when she had finished giving him drink, she said, Also for thy camels will I draw water, until they have finished drinking.

20. And she hastened, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.

21. And the man was wondering at her; remaining silent, to discover whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not.

22. And it came to pass, as the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a golden earring, half a shekel in weight, and two bracelets for her hands, ten gold shekels in weight;

23. And he said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee; is there room in thy father’s house for us to stay this night in?

24. And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore unto Nachor.

25. She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender in plenty, as also room to lodge in.

26. And the man bowed down his head, and prostrated himself before the Lord.

27. And he said, Blessed be the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who hath not withdrawn his mercy and his truth from my master; I being on the way, which the Lord hath led me, to the house of the brethren of my master.

28. And the maiden ran, and told at her mother’s house these things.

29. And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban; and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.

30. And this came to pass, when he saw the earring and the bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man unto me; and he came unto the man; and, behold, he was standing by the camels at the well.

31. And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord; wherefore standest thou without? while I have prepared the house and room for the camels.

32. And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels; and he gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of the men that were with him.

33. And there was set food before him to eat; but he said, I will not eat, until I have spoken my words. And he said, Speak on.

34. And he said, I am Abraham’s servant.

35. And the Lord hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and camels, and asses.

36. And Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master after she was become old: and he hath given unto him all that he hath.

37. And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:

38. But thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.

39. And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.

40. And he said unto me, The Lord, before whom I have walked will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; that thou mayest take a wife for my son from my kindred, and from my father’s house.

41. Then shalt thou be clear from my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they do not give thee one, then shalt thou be clear from my oath.

42. And I came this day unto the well, and said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, if thou wouldst but prosper my way on which I am going.

43. Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall be the young woman who cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water out of thy pitcher to drink;

44. And she say to me, Both drink thou, and also for thy camels will I draw: this shall be the wife whom the Lord hath destined for my master’s son.

45. And before I had yet finished speaking to my own heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water; and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.

46. And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and also to thy camels I will give drink; and I drank, and she made the camels drink also.

47. And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nachor’s son, whom Milcah bore unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.

48. And I bowed down my head, and prostrated myself before the Lord; and I blessed the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take the daughter of my master’s brother for his son.

49. And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right, or to the left.

50. Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing hath proceeded from the Lord; we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.

51. Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be the wife of thy master’s son, as the Lord hath spoken.

52. And it came to pass, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, that he prostrated himself to the earth unto the Lord.

53. And the servant brought forth vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah; and precious things he gave to her brother and to her mother.

54. And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried the night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.

55. And her brother and her mother said, Let the maiden abide with us, a year or ten months; after that she shall go.

56. And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the Lord hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.

57. And they said, We will call the maiden, and inquire her own decision.

58. And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.

59. And thereupon they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men.

60. And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of myriads, and let thy seed possess the gate of those who hate them.

61. And Rebekah arose with her maidens, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man; and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.

62. And Isaac came from a walk to the well Lachai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country;

63. And Isaac was gone out to meditate in the field toward evening; and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, camels were coming.

64. And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and she saw Isaac; and she alighted off the camel.

65. And she said unto the servant, Who is yonder man that walketh in the field toward us? And the servant said, This is my master; therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.

66. And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.

67. And Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.

## Genesis 25

1. Then Abraham took again a wife, and her name was Keturah.

2. And she bore him Zimran, and Yokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Yishbak, and Shuach.

3. And Yokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.

4. And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Chanoch, and Abida’, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.

5. And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.

6. But unto the sons of the concubines that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he was yet living, eastward, unto the east country.

7. And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, one hundred seventy and five years.

8. Then Abraham departed this life, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people.

9. And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zochar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;

10. The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, with Sarah his wife.

11. And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lachai-roi.

12. Now theses are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bore unto Abraham.

13. And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebayoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,

14. And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,

15. Chadad, and Tema, Yetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.

16. These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.

17. And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, one hundred and thirty and seven years: and he departed this life and died; and was gathered unto his people.

18. And they dwelt from Chavilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: he dwelt in the presence of all his brethren.

19. And these are the generations of Isaac, the son of Abraham: Abraham begat Isaac.

20. And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian, of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian, to himself as wife.

21. And Isaac entreated the Lord in behalf of his wife, because she was barren: and the Lord was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.

22. And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why did I desire this? And she went to inquire of the Lord.

23. And the Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.

24. And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.

25. And the first came out red, all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.

26. And after that came his brother out, his hand holding on to Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.

27. And the boys grew up: and Esau was an expert hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.

28. And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison; but Rebekah loved Jacob.

29. And Jacob at one time boiled pottage, and Esau came from the field, and he was faint.

30. And Esau said to Jacob, Let me swallow down, I pray thee, some of that yonder red pottage, for I am faint; therefore was his name called Edom.

31. And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy right of first-born.

32. And Esau said, Behold, I am going to die; and what profit then can the right of first-born be to me?

33. And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he swore unto him, and he sold his right of first-born unto Jacob.

34. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles, and he did eat and drink, and he rose up, and went his way; thus Esau despised the birthright.

## Genesis 26

1. And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham; and Isaac went unto Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, unto Gerar.

2. And the Lord appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.

3. Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, will I give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I swore unto Abraham thy father;

4. And I will cause thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and I will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves.

5. Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.

6. And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.

7. And the men of the place asked him concerning his wife; and he said, She is my sister; for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah, because she is of a handsome appearance.

8. And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, looked out at a window, and saw, and behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.

9. And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I thought, Perhaps I may die for her.

10. And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? How easily might one of the people have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldst have brought guiltiness upon us.

11. And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.

12. Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundred-fold: so the Lord blessed him.

13. And the man became great, and went forward and grew, until he became very great;

14. And he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants; and the Philistines envied him.

15. And all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, these the Philistines stopped, and filled them with earth.

16. And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go away from us; for thou hast become much mightier than we.

17. And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.

18. And Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, and which the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham; and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.

19. And the servants of Isaac dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.

20. And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac’s herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Essek; because they strove with him.

21. And they dug another well, and they strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.

22. And he removed from there, and dug another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rechoboth, and he said, For now the Lord hath made room for us, and we shall increase in the land.

23. And he went up from there to Beer-sheba.

24. And the Lord appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father; fear not, for I am with thee, and I will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for the sake of Abraham my servant.

25. And he built there an altar, and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched there his tent: and the servants of Isaac dug there a well.

26. Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Achuzzath his friend, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.

27. And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing that ye do hate me, and have sent me away from you?

28. And they said, We saw clearly that the Lord was with thee; and we said, Let there be now an oath between us and thee; and we will make a covenant with thee;

29. That thou shalt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now one blessed of the Lord.

30. And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.

31. And they rose up betimes in the morning, and they swore one to the other; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.

32. And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and they said unto him, We have found water.

33. And he called it Shibah: therefore is the name of the city Beer-sheba unto this day.

34. And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri, the Hittite, and Bahsemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.

35. And they were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.

## Genesis 27

1. And it came to pass, when Isaac was old, and his eyes were too dim to see, that he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.

2. And he said, Behold now, I am grown old, I know not the day of my death:

3. Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and hunt for me some venison;

4. And make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.

5. And Rebekah heard as Isaac was speaking to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.

6. And Rebekah spoke unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,

7. Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat and bless thee before the Lord before my death.

8. And now, my son, obey my voice in that which I command thee.

9. Go, I pray thee, to the flock, and fetch me from there two good kids; and I will make them savory food for thy father, such as he loveth:

10. And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat; for the sake that he may bless thee before his death.

11. And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:

12. Peradventure my father will feel me, and I shall then seem to him as a deceiver; and I would bring upon me a curse, and not a blessing.

13. And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son; only obey my voice, and go fetch them to me.

14. And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savory food, such as his father loved.

15. And Rebekah took the goodly garments of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and clothed therewith Jacob her younger son;

16. And the skins of the kids she put upon his hands, and upon the smooth part of his neck;

17. And she gave the savory food and bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of Jacob her son.

18. And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou my son?

19. And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first-born; I have done as thou didst speak to me: arise I pray thee, sit here and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.

20. And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the Lord thy God brought it before me.

21. And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be truly my son Esau or not.

22. And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father, and he felt him; and he said, The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.

23. And he recognized him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him.

24. And he said, Art thou indeed my son Esau? and he said I am.

25. And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat, and he brought him wine, and he drank.

26. And Isaac his father said unto him, Come near, I pray thee, and kiss me, my son.

27. And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his garments and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is the smell of the field which the Lord hath blessed.

28. And may God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine;

29. Nations shall serve thee, and people bow down to thee; be lord over thy brethren, and thy mother’s sons shall bow down to thee; cursed be they that curse thee, and blessed be they that bless thee.

30. And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarcely gone out from the presence of his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.

31. And he also made savory food, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, in order that thy soul may bless me.

32. And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy first-born, Esau.

33. And Isaac trembled greatly, exceedingly, and said, Who was it? where is he that had hunted venison, and brought it me, and I ate of all before thou camest, and blessed him? yea, he shall also remain blessed.

34. When Esau heard the words of his father, he uttered a great and exceedingly bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, also me, my father.

35. And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and took away thy blessing.

36. And he said, Hath he been therefore named Jacob, because he hath supplanted me these two times? my right of first-born he took away; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing: and he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me.

37. And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I endowed him: and what can I do now for thee, my son.

38. And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou then but one blessing, my father? bless me, also me, my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.

39. And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and blessed by the dew of heaven from above;

40. And by thy sword shalt thou live, and thy brother shalt thou serve; and it shall come to pass, that when thou shalt have the dominion, thou canst break his yoke from off thy neck.

41. And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father had blessed him; and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father will be at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.

42. And Rebekah was informed of the words of Esau her elder son: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau doth comfort himself, with regard to thee, purposing to kill thee.

43. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother, to Charan;

44. And tarry with him a short time, until thy brother’s fury turn away;

45. Until thy brother’s anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then will I send, and fetch thee from there; why should I be deprived of both of you at once in one day?

46. And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth; if Jacob take a wife from the daughters of Heth, such as these, from the daughters of the land, what good will life do me?

## Genesis 28

1. And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.

2. Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother’s father; and take thyself from there a wife of the daughters of Laban thy mother’s brother.

3. And God, the Almighty, bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest become a multitude of people;

4. And may he give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojourn, which God gave unto Abraham.

5. And Isaac sent away Jacob, and he went to Padan-aram, unto Laban, the son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.

6. And when Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take himself from there a wife; and in blessing him had given him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;

7. And that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padan-aram:

8. Then saw Esau that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the eyes of Isaac his father;

9. And Esau went unto Ishmael, and took Machalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebayoth in addition to his wives, to himself as wife.

10. And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Charan.

11. And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took one of the stones of the place, and put it for his pillow, and laid himself down in that place.

12. And he dreamed, and behold a ladder was set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold, angels of God were ascending and descending on it.

13. And, behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord, the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;

14. And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north and to the south; and in thee and thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.

15. And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done what I have spoken to thee of.

16. And Jacob awakened out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is present in this place; and I knew it not.

17. And he was afraid, and said, How fearful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.

18. And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillow, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.

19. And he called the name of that place Beth-el; but Luz was the name of that city in former times.

20. And Jacob made a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me on this way which I am going, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,

21. And I come again in peace to my father’s house: then shall the Lord be my God;

22. And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house; and of all that thou wilt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.

## Genesis 29

1. Then Jacob lifted up his feet and went unto the land of the children of the east.

2. And he looked, and behold there was a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and the stone upon the mouth of the well was great.

3. And there all the flocks were wont to assemble; and they rolled then the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep; and they put the stone again upon the mouth of the well in its place.

4. And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence are ye? And they said, Of Charan are we.

5. And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nachor? And they said, We know him.

6. And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well; and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.

7. And he said, Lo, the day is yet long, it is not time that the cattle should be driven home; water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.

8. And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, then do they roll the stone from the mouth of the well; and we water the sheep.

9. And while he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep; for she was a shepherdess.

10. And it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.

11. And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.

12. And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that he was Rebekah’s son: and she ran and told her father.

13. And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.

14. And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.

15. And Laban then said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldst thou therefore serve me for naught? tell me, what shall thy wages be?

16. And Laban had two daughters; the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.

17. And the eyes of Leah were tender; but Rachel was of handsome form and handsome appearance.

18. And Jacob loved Rachel; and he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.

19. And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man; abide with me.

20. And Jacob served for Rachel seven years; and they seemed unto him but a few days, through the love he had to her.

21. And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.

22. And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.

23. And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.

24. And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah, Zilpah his maid for a handmaid.

25. And it came to pass that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did I not serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou deceived me?

26. And Laban said, It is not done so in our place, to give in marriage the younger before the first-born.

27. Fulfill the week of this, and we will give thee this one also, for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.

28. And Jacob did so, and fulfilled the week of the first; and he gave him Rachel his daughter for a wife.

29. And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his hand-maid to be her maid.

30. And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah; and he served with him yet seven other years.

31. And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.

32. And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben; for she said, Surely, the Lord hath looked upon my affliction, because now my husband will love me.

33. And she conceived again and bore a son; and she said, Because the Lord heard that I was hated, he hath given me this one also; and she called his name Simeon.

34. And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons; therefore was his name called Levi.

35. And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she said, This time will I praise the Lord; therefore she called his name Judah: and she left off bearing.

## Genesis 30

1. And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and she said unto Jacob, Give me children, and if not, I die.

2. And Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God’s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?

3. And she said, Behold, here is my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.

4. And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid for wife, and Jacob went in unto her.

5. And Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son.

6. And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.

7. And Bilhah, Rachel’s maid, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.

8. And Rachel said, Contests of God have I contended with my sister, I have also prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.

9. When Leah now saw that she had left off bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her to Jacob for wife.

10. And Zilpah Leah’s maid bore Jacob a son.

11. And Leah said, Good luck hath come: and she called his name Gad.

12. And Zilpah Leah’s maid bore a second son unto Jacob.

13. And Leah said, To my happiness; for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher.

14. And Reuben went in the days of the wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and he brought them unto Leah his mother; then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, some of thy son’s mandrakes.

15. And she said unto her, Is it not enough that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldst thou also take away my son’s mandrakes? And Rachel said, Therefore shall he be with thee to-night for thy son’s mandrakes.

16. And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Unto me thou must come in; for surely I have obtained thee as a reward with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.

17. And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.

18. And Leah said, God hath given me my reward, because I have given my maid to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.

19. And Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son unto Jacob.

20. And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons; and she called his name Zebulun.

21. And afterward she bore a daughter, and she called her name Dinah.

22. And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.

23. And she conceived, and bore a son; and she said, God hath taken away my reproach.

24. And she called his name Joseph, saying, The Lord shall add to me another son.

25. And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto my own place, and to my country.

26. Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go; for thou knowest my service with which I have served thee.

27. And Laban said unto him, If I could but find favor in thy eyes; I have learned by experience that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake:

28. And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give them.

29. And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and what thy cattle hath become with me.

30. For it was a little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased into a multitude; and the Lord hath blessed thee since my coming; and now when shall I provide also for my own house?

31. And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me the least; if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock:

32. I will pass through all thy flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted lamb, and every brown lamb among the sheep, and whatever is spotted and speckled among the goats; and such shall be after this my reward.

33. And my righteousness shall testify for me in time to come, when it shall come with my reward before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.

34. And Laban said, Well, let it be according to thy word.

35. And he removed on that day the he-goats that were ring-streaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had some white on it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.

36. And he put a space of three days’ journey between himself and Jacob; and Jacob fed the flocks of Laban that were left.

37. And Jacob took himself rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chestnut tree; and peeled thereon white streaks, laying bare the white which was on the rods.

38. And he set the rods which he had peeled in the gutters in the watering troughs, where the flocks came to drink, just before the flocks, and where they conceived, when they came to drink.

39. And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth ring-streaked, speckled, and spotted.

40. And these lambs did Jacob separate, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ring-streaked, and whatever was brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not with Laban’s cattle.

41. And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.

42. But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in; so the feebler belonged to Laban, and the stronger to Jacob.

43. And the man increased exceedingly, and he had many flocks, and maid-servants, and men-servants, and camels, and asses.

## Genesis 31

1. And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father’s, and of that which was our father’s hath he gotten all this wealth.

2. And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.

3. And the Lord said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy birthplace; and I will be with thee.

4. And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock.

5. And he said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.

6. And ye know well that with all my power I have served your father.

7. And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times: but God suffered him not to do me evil.

8. If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages: then bore all the flocks speckled: and if he said thus, The ring-streaked shall be thy reward; then bore all the flocks ring-streaked.

9. Thus God took away the cattle of your father, and gave them to me.

10. And it came to pass at the time that the flocks conceived, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the flocks were ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled.

11. And an angel of God spoke unto me in the dream, Jacob: and I said, Here am I.

12. And he said, Lift up now thy eyes and see, all the rams which leap upon the flocks are ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled; for I have seen all that Laban doth unto thee.

13. I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou madest unto me a vow: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy birth.

14. And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?

15. Were we not counted of him as strangers? for he hath sold us; and he hath quite consumed also our money.

16. For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children’s; now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.

17. Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;

18. And he led away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his acquiring, which he had gotten in Padan-aram, to go to Isaac his father into the land of Canaan.

19. And Laban was gone to shear his sheep; and Rachel stole the images that were her father’s.

20. And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, by not letting him know that he was going to flee.

21. And he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.

22. And it was told to Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.

23. And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him a seven days’ journey; and he overtook him at the mount of Gilead.

24. And God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream of the night, and said unto him, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

25. Then Laban overtook Jacob; now Jacob had pitched his tent on the mount, and Laban with his brethren pitched on the mount of Gilead.

26. And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and led away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword.

27. Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and why didst thou not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?

28. And why hast thou not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now thou hast acted foolishly in so doing.

29. It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt; but the God of your father spoke unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

30. And now, thou wouldst needs be gone, because thou greatly longedst after thy father’s house; yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods.

31. And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid, for I said, Peradventure thou wouldst take by force thy daughters from me.

32. With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live; before our brethren seek out thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee; but Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.

33. And Laban went into the tent of Jacob, and into the tent of Leah, and into the tent of the two maid-servants; but he found nothing; he then went out of the tent of Leah, and entered into Rachel’s tent.

34. Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the saddle-cushion of the camel, and sat upon them; and Laban searched all the tent, and found nothing.

35. And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me; and thus he searched, but found not the images.

36. Now Jacob became wroth, and quarrelled with Laban; and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?

37. Although thou hast searched all my goods, what hast thou found of all the articles of thy household? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge between us both.

38. These twenty years have I been with thee: thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young; and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.

39. That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I had to bear the loss of it, of my hand didst thou require it, whatever was stolen by day, or stolen by night.

40. Where I was in the day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from my eyes.

41. These twenty years have I been in thy house; I have served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flocks: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.

42. Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst now sent me away empty; my affliction and the labor of my hands God hath seen, and decided yesternight.

43. And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine; but as to my daughters, what can I do unto them this day, or unto their children whom they have born?

44. And now, come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.

45. And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.

46. And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap; and they ate there upon the heap.

47. And Laban called it Yegar-sahadutha; but Jacob called it Galed.

48. And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day; therefore called he its name Galed;

49. And Mitzpah; for he said, The Lord shall watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from the other;

50. If thou shouldst afflict my daughters, or if thou shouldst take other wives besides my daughters, when there is no man with us: see, God is witness between me and thee.

51. And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast up between me and thee;

52. Witness be this heap and witness be this pillar, that I will not pass by this heap, and that thou shalt not pass unto me by this heap and this pillar, for evil.

53. The God of Abraham and the God of Nachor shall judge between us, the God of their father; but Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.

54. Then Jacob slew some cattle upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread; and they did eat bread, and tarried all night on the mount.

55. And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them; and Laban departed, and returned unto his own place.

## Genesis 32

1. And Jacob went on his way, and there met him angels of God.

2. And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is a host of God; and he called the name of that place Machanayim.

3. And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.

4. And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord, to Esau, Thus hath said thy servant Jacob, With Laban have I sojourned, and stayed until now.

5. And I have acquired oxen, and asses, flocks, and men-servants, and women-servants; and I send now to tell my lord, to find grace in thy eyes.

6. And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother, to Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.

7. Then Jacob was greatly afraid, and he felt distressed; and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two bands.

8. And he said, If Esau should come to the one band and smite it, then the other band which is left may escape.

9. And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the Lord who saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy birthplace, and I will deal well with thee:

10. I am not worthy of all the kindness, and of all the truth, which thou hast shown unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.

11. Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, the mother with the children.

12. And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.

13. And he lodged there that same night; and he took of that which he carried with him a present for Esau his brother:

14. Two hundred she-goats, and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams.

15. Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty cows, and ten bulls, twenty she-asses, and ten foals.

16. And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself; and he said unto his servants, Pass on before me, and put a space between drove and drove.

17. And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother should meet thee, and ask thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither art thou going? and for whom are these before thee?

18. Then shalt thou say, They belong to thy servant, to Jacob; it is a present sent unto my lord, to Esau; and, behold, also, he is himself behind us.

19. And so he commanded also the second, also the third, as also all that followed the droves, saying, After this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.

20. And say ye moreover, Behold, also thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will receive me kindly.

21. The present went thus on before him; and he lodged himself that night in the camp.

22. And he rose up that night, and he took his two wives, and his two women-servants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Yabbok.

23. And he took them, and sent them over the stream and sent over what he had.

24. And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.

25. And when he saw that he could net prevail against him, he struck against the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was put out of joint, as he was wrestling with him.

26. And he said, Let me go, for the day hath dawned. And he said, I will not let thee go until thou hast blessed me.

27. And he said unto him, What is thy name? and he said, Jacob.

28. And he said, Not Jacob shall any more be called thy name, but Israel; for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.

29. And Jacob asked him, and said, tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.

30. And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen an angel of God face to face, and my life hath been preserved.

31. And the sun rose unto him as he passed by Penuel, and he halted upon his thigh.

32. Therefore do the children of Israel not eat the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day; because he struck against the hollow of Jacob’s thigh on the sinew that shrank.

## Genesis 33

1. And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.

2. And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.

3. And he himself passed on before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.

4. And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him; and they wept.

5. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The children whom God hath graciously given thy servant.

6. Then came the handmaids near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.

7. And Leah also with her children came near, and they bowed themselves; and after that came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.

8. And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I have met? And he said, To find grace in the eyes of my lord.

9. And Esau said, I have enough, my brother, keep unto thyself what thou hast.

10. And Jacob said, This must not be, I pray thee; if I have but found grace in thy eyes, then do thou receive my present at my hand; since I have seen thy face, it is as though I had seen the face of an angel, and because thou hast received me kindly.

11. Take, I pray thee, my present that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have a plenty of all. And he urged him, and he took it.

12. And he said, Let us depart, and move farther, and I will travel near thee.

13. And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are a charge on me: and if they should overdrive them one day, all the flock would die.

14. Let my lord, I pray thee, pass on before his servant: and I will lead on slowly, according to the cattle that goeth before me and the children may be able to travel, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.

15. And Esau said, Let me, I pray thee, leave with thee some of the people that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me only final grace in the eyes of my lord.

16. So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.

17. And Jacob journeyed to Succoth and built himself a house, and for his cattle he made booths; therefore he called the name of the place Succoth.

18. And Jacob came in good health to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and he encamped before the city.

19. And he bought the parcel of the field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Chamor, the father of Shechem, for a hundred kessitah.

20. And he erected there an altar, and called it, El-Elohe-Yisrael.

## Genesis 34

1. And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had born unto Jacob, went out to look about among the daughters of the land.

2. And Shechem the son of Chamor the Hivite, the prince of the country, saw her; and he took her, and lay with her, and did her violence.

3. And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the maiden, and spoke kindly unto the maiden.

4. And Shechem spoke unto Chamor his father, saying, Get me this girl for wife.

5. And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; but his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.

6. And Chamor the father of Shechem went out unto to Jacob to speak with him.

7. And the sons of Jacob came from the field when they heard it, and the men were grieved, and it excited their anger greatly; because he had wrought a disgraceful thing in Israel to lie with the daughter of Jacob, and this ought not to be done.

8. And Chamor spoke with them, saying, The soul of Shechem my son longeth for your daughter; give her, I pray you, unto him for wife.

9. And intermarry with us; your daughters ye shall give unto us, and our daughters ye may take unto yourselves.

10. And with us shall ye dwell; and the land shall be open before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and acquire possessions therein.

11. And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brother, Let me but find grace in your eyes, and whatever ye may say unto me, I will give.

12. Ask of me ever so much dowry and gift, and I will give, just as ye may say unto me; but give me the maiden for wife.

13. And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Chamor his father with cunning, and spoke; because he had defiled Dinah their sister.

14. And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that would be a reproach unto us.

15. But on this condition will we consent unto you; if ye will become as we are, that every male of you be circumcised:

16. Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters unto us; and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.

17. But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised, then will we take our daughter, and go our way.

18. And their words were pleasing in the eyes of Chamor, and in the eyes of Shechem, the son of Chamor.

19. And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter; and he was the most honored of all the house of his father.

20. And Chamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and spoke with the men of their city, saying,

21. These men are peaceably inclined with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; and the land, behold, it is large enough on all sides before them; their daughters we will take unto us for wives, and our daughters we will give unto them.

22. Only with this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us, to become one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.

23. Their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs will they not be ours? only let us consent unto them, that they may dwell with us.

24. And unto Chamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and all the males were circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.

25. And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, took each his sword, and came upon the city unresisted and slew all the males.

26. And they slew Chamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword; and they took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went out.

27. The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.

28. They took their sheep and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field.

29. And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives they took captive, and spoiled; and all that was in the house.

30. And Jacob said unto Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, to cause me to be hated among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and as I am but few in number, they may gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I would be destroyed, I and my house.

31. And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?

## Genesis 35

1. And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there; and make there an altar unto the God that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.

2. Then said Jacob unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and cleanse yourselves, and change your garments.

3. And let us arise, and go up to Beth-el: and I will make there an altar unto the God who answered me on the day of my distress, and was with me on the way which I went.

4. And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and the earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was near Shechem.

5. And they journeyed; and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.

6. So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Beth-el, he and all the people that were with him.

7. And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.

8. And Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried beneath Beth-el under an oak: and he called its named Allon-bachuth.

9. And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Padan-aram, and blessed him.

10. And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob; thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.

11. And God said unto him, I am God the Almighty; be fruitful and multiply; a nation and an assemblage of nations shall spring from thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins.

12. And the land which I gave to Abraham and to Isaac, to thee will I give it; and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.

13. And God went up from him on the place where he had spoken with him.

14. And Jacob set up a pillar at the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.

15. And Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him, Beth-el.

16. And they journeyed from Beth-el: and there was yet some distance to come to Ephrath, when Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.

17. And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; for this child also is a son for thee.

18. And it came to pass, as her soul was departing, for she died that she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin.

19. And so Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath, which is Beth-lechem.

20. And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: this is the pillar of Rachel’s grave unto this day.

21. And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of flocks Eder.

22. And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine; and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.

23. The sons of Leah, Jacob’s first-born, Reuben, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun.

24. The sons of Rachel, Joseph, and Benjamin.

25. And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid, Dan, and Naphtali.

26. And the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid, Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Padan-aram.

27. And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, the city of Arba’, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.

28. And the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years.

29. And Isaac departed this life, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old and full of days; and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.

## Genesis 36

1. Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.

2. Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;

3. And Bahsemath Ishmael’s daughter, the sister of Nebayoth.

4. And Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz; and Bahsemath bore Reuel;

5. And Aholibamah bore Yeush, and Ya’lam, and Korach: these are the sons of Esau, that were born unto him in the land Canaan.

6. And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had gotten in the land of Canaan; and went into another country from the face of his brother Jacob.

7. For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land of their sojourning could not bear them, because of their cattle.

8. Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.

9. And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edom in mount Seir.

10. These are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bahsemath the wife of Esau.

11. And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Ga’tam, and Kenaz.

12. And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau’s son: and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek; these were the sons of Adah, Esau’s wife.

13. And these are the sons of Reuel: Nachath, and Zerach, Shammah, and Mizzah; these were the sons of Bahsemath, Esau’s wife.

14. And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau’s wife: and she bore to Esau Yeush, and Ya’lam, and Korach.

15. These are the dukes of the sons of Esau; the sons of Eliphaz the first-born of Esau: duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,

16. Duke Korach, duke Ga’tam, duke Amalek; these are the dukes of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah.

17. And these are the sons of Reuel Esau’s son: duke Nachath, duke Zerach, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah; these are the dukes of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bahsemath, Esau’s wife.

18. And these are the sons of Aholibamah, Esau’s wife: duke Yeush, duke Ya’lam, duke Korach; these are the dukes of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau’s wife.

19. These are the sons of Esau, and these are their dukes; this is Edom.

20. These are the sons of Seir the Chorite, who inhabited the land: Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,

21. And Dishon, and Etzer, and Dishan; these are the dukes of the Chorites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.

22. And the children of Lotan were Chori and Heman; and Lotan’s sister was Timna.

23. And these were the children of Shobal: Alvan, and Manachath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.

24. And these are the children of Zibeon: both Ajah, and Anah; this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.

25. And these are the children of Anah: Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.

26. And these are the children of Dishan: Chemdan, and Eshban, and Yithran, and Cheran.

27. These are the children of Etzer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.

28. These are the children of Dishan: Uz, and Aran.

29. These are the dukes of the Chorites: duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah;

30. Duke Dishon, duke Etzer, duke Dishan; these are the dukes of the Chorites, after their dukes in the land of Seir.

31. And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.

32. And there reigned in Edom Bela the son of Beor: and the name of his city was Dinhabah.

33. And Bela died, and there reigned in his stead Yobab the son of Zerach of Bozrah.

34. And Yobab died, and there reigned in his stead Chusham of the land of Teman.

35. And Chusham died, and there reigned in his stead Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab; and the name of his city was Avith.

36. And Hadad died, and there reigned in his stead Samlah of Masrekah.

37. And Samlah died, and there reigned in his stead Shaul of Rechoboth by the river.

38. And Shaul died, and there reigned in his stead Baal-chanan the son of Achbor.

39. And Baal-chanan the son of Achbor died, and there reigned in his stead Hadar, and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife’s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab.

40. And these are the names of the dukes of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names: duke Timna, duke Alvah, duke Yetheth,

41. Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon.

42. Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,

43. Duke Magdiel, duke Iram; these are the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession: this is Esau the father of the Edom.

## Genesis 37

1. And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father’s sojourning, in the land of Canaan.

2. These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers; and he was as a lad with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives; and Joseph brought evil reports of them unto his father.

3. Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a coat of many colors.

4. And when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.

5. And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers: and they hated him yet the more.

6. And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed.

7. And, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also remained standing upright; and, behold, your sheaves placed themselves round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.

8. And his brothers said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.

9. And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers; and he said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me.

10. And he told it to his father, and to his brothers; and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall we indeed come, I and thy mother, and thy brothers, to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth.

11. And his brothers envied him; but his father noted the matter in his mind.

12. And his brothers went to feed their father’s flocks in Shechem.

13. And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brothers feed the flocks in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.

14. And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brothers, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him from the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.

15. And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering astray in the field; and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?

16. And he said, I seek my brothers; tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding their flocks?

17. And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.

18. And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.

19. And they said one to another, Behold, here comes this man of dreams.

20. And now, come and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.

21. And when Reuben heard it, he delivered him out of their hand; and he said, Let us not put him to death.

22. And Reuben said unto them, Do not shed blood; but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but do not lay hand upon him; —in order that he might deliver him out of their hand, to bring him back again to his father.

23. And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brothers, that they stript Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;

24. And they took him, and cast him into the pit; and the pit was empty; there was no water in it.

25. And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead; and their camels were bearing spicery, and balm, and lotus, going to carry it down to Egypt.

26. And Judah said unto his brothers, What profit will it be if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?

27. Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, but let our hand not be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brothers hearkened to him.

28. And when the Midianitish men, merchants, passed by, they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.

29. And when Reuben returned unto the pit, and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit, he rent his clothes.

30. And he returned unto his brothers, and said, The child is not there; and I, whither shall I go?

31. And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the blood;

32. And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, This have we found: acknowledge, we pray thee, whether it be thy son’s coat or not.

33. And he recognized it, and said, it is my son’s coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is surely torn in pieces.

34. And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.

35. And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I must go down unto my son, mourning, into the grave; thus his father wept for him.

36. And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guards.

## Genesis 38

1. And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brothers, and he pitched his tent with a certain Adullamite whose name was Chirah.

2. And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shua; and he took her, and went in unto her.

3. And she conceived, and bore a son; and he called his name ‘Er.

4. And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she called his name Onan.

5. And she again bore another son; and she called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him.

6. And Judah took a wife for ‘Er his first-born, whose name was Tamar.

7. And ‘Er, Judah’s first-born, was displeasing in the eyes of the Lord; and the Lord slew him.

8. And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and take her, as her brother-in-law, and raise up seed to thy brother.

9. Onan thus knew that the seed should not be his, and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled it on the ground, so as not to give seed unto his brother.

10. And the thing which he did was displeasing in the eyes of the Lord: wherefore he slew him also.

11. Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow at thy father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown; for he thought, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brothers have done. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.

12. And many days had elapsed when the daughter of Shua, Judah’s wife, died; and after Judah was comforted, he went up unto his sheep-shearers, he and his friend Chirah the Adullamite, to Timnah.

13. And it was told unto Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep.

14. And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered herself with a vail, and concealed her face, and seated herself at the cross-road, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him for wife.

15. And Judah saw her and thought her to be a harlot; because she had covered her face.

16. And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?

17. And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, If thou wilt give me a pledge, till thou send it.

18. And he said, What is the pledge which I shall give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy scarf, and thy staff that is in thy hand. And he gave them unto her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.

19. And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.

20. And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to take the pledge out of the woman’s hand; but he found her not.

21. Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was at the cross-road on the highway? And they said, There hath been no harlot in this neighborhood.

22. And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place have said, There hath been no harlot in this place.

23. And Judah said, Let her keep it, lest we be put to shame; behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.

24. And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told to Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by prostitution. And Judah said, Lead her forth, and let her be burnt.

25. When she was led forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Acknowledge, I pray thee, to whom belong these, the signet, the scarf, and staff.

26. And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her not again any more.

27. And it came to pass at the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.

28. And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.

29. And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold his brother came out; and she said, How hast thou broken forth! this breach is upon thee: therefore his name was called Perez.

30. And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zerach.

## Genesis 39

1. And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guards, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down thither.

2. And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was thus in the house of his master the Egyptian.

3. And when his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord caused all that he did to prosper in his hand:

4. Joseph found grace in his eyes, and he served him; and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.

5. And it came to pass from the time he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the Egyptian’s house for the sake of Joseph; and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field.

6. And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he troubled himself not about aught he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was handsome in form and handsome in appearance.

7. And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.

8. But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, Thy master troubleth himself not about what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath into my hand;

9. There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great evil, and sin against God?

10. And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, and he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her;

11. That it came to pass one particular day, that he went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.

12. And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me; and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and ran out into the street.

13. And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,

14. That she called unto the men of her house, and spoke unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in unto us a Hebrew man to have his sport with us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:

15. And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and ran out into the street.

16. And she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home.

17. And she spoke unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant whom thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to have his sport with me.

18. And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled forth.

19. And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke unto him, saying, After this manner hath thy servant done to me; that his wrath was kindled.

20. And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were imprisoned: and he was there in the prison.

21. But the Lord was with Joseph, and caused him to find kindness, and gave him favor in the eyes of the superintendent of the prison.

22. And the superintendent of the prison committed into Joseph’s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, was done through him.

23. The superintendent of the prison looked not after the least that was under his hand, because the Lord was with him; and that which he did, the Lord made to prosper.

## Genesis 40

1. And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and the baker committed an offense, against their lord the king of Egypt.

2. And Pharaoh was wroth against his two officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.

3. And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guards, into the prison, the place where Joseph was confined.

4. And the captain of the guards charged Joseph with them, and he served them; and they continued a season in ward.

5. And they dreamed a dream, both of them, each his dream in one night, each in accordance with the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison.

6. And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked at them, and, behold, they were sad.

7. And he asked the officers of Pharaoh that were with him in ward in his lord’s house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly today?

8. And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is none to interpret it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell it to me, I pray you.

9. The chief of the butlers then told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;

10. And on the vine were three branches; and it was as though it budded, shot forth its blossoms, and on its clusters the grapes became ripe:

11. And Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them out into Pharaoh’s cup, and I placed the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.

12. And Joseph said unto him, This is its interpretation: The three branches are three days;

13. Within yet three days will Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee unto thy office; and thou shalt place Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.

14. Therefore if thou thinkest on me when it shall be well with thee, then show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house;

15. For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews; and here also have I not done the least that they should put me into the dungeon.

16. And when the chief of the bakers saw that he had well interpreted, he said unto Joseph, I also saw in my dream, and, behold, I had three baskets with fine bread on my head:

17. And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats, used as food for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket from my head.

18. And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation: The three baskets are three days;

19. Within yet three days will Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and will hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.

20. And it came to pass on the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief of the butlers and the head of the chief of the bakers among his servants.

21. And he restored the chief of the butlers unto his butlership; and he placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand;

22. But the chief of the bakers he hanged, as Joseph had interpreted to them.

23. Yet the chief of the butlers did not remember Joseph, and forgot him.

## Genesis 41

1. And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.

2. And, behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, of good appearance and fat in flesh; and they fed in the meadow.

3. And, behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean in flesh; and they stood by the other cows upon the brink of the river.

4. And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed cows did eat up the seven well-favored and fat cows. And Pharaoh awoke.

5. And he slept and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up on one stalk, rank and good.

6. And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.

7. And the seven thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.

8. And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret the same unto Pharaoh.

9. Then spoke the chief of the butlers unto Pharaoh, saying, My faults I must call to remembrance this day:

10. Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guards, me and the chief of the bakers;

11. And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each in accordance with the interpretation of his dream.

12. And there was with us a Hebrew lad, a servant to the captain of the guards; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each according to his dream did he interpret.

13. And it came to pass, just as he had interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto my office, and him he hanged.

14. Then Pharaoh sent and had Joseph called, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his garments, and came in unto Pharaoh.

15. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.

16. And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me; God will give an answer for the peace of Pharaoh.

17. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of the river;

18. And, behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, fat in flesh and good in shape; and they fed in the meadow;

19. And, behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ill-shaped and lean in flesh; I never saw any like these in all the land of Egypt for ugliness;

20. And the lean and the ill-favored cows did eat up the first seven fat cows;

21. And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but their appearance was still as bad as at the beginning. And I awoke.

22. And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up on one stalk, full and good;

23. And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them;

24. And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could tell it to me.

25. And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, the dream of Pharaoh is one, that which God is about to do, he hath told to Pharaoh.

26. The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years; the dream is one.

27. And the seven thin and ill-favored cows that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears, blasted with the east wind, shall be seven years of famine.

28. This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he hath shown unto Pharaoh.

29. Behold, there are coming seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:

30. And there shall arise seven years of famine after them, when all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;

31. And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following it; for it shall be very grievous.

32. And as it respecteth that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice, it is because the thing is firmly resolved on by God, and God hasteneth to bring it to pass.

33. Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.

34. Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the produce of the land of Egypt in the seven years of plenty.

35. And let them gather up all the food of those good years that are coming, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, as food in the cities, and keep the same.

36. And that food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land be not cut off through the famine.

37. And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.

38. And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom the spirit of God is?

39. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Inasmuch as God hath caused thee to know all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou:

40. Thou shalt be over my house, and according to thy word shall all my people be ruled, only in regard to the throne will I be greater than thou.

41. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.

42. And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a golden chain about his neck;

43. And he caused him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bend the knee: and he placed him thus over all the land of Egypt.

44. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh; but without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.

45. And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-pa’neach; and he gave him Assenath the daughter of Poti-phera’, the priest of On, for wife. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.

46. And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh the king of Egypt; and Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.

47. And the earth brought forth in the seven years of plenty by handfuls.

48. And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field of the city, which was round about it, laid he up in the same.

49. And Joseph heaped up corn as the sand of the sea, very much; until he left off numbering, for it was without number.

50. And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, whom Assenath the daughter of Poti-phera’ the priest of On, bore unto him.

51. And Joseph called the name of the first-born Menasseh: For God said he hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.

52. And the name of the second he called Ephraim; For God said he hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

53. And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.

54. And the seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said; and there was famine in all the countries, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.

55. And when all the land of Egypt also felt hunger, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.

56. And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the store-houses, wherein corn was, and sold unto the Egyptians; for the famine grew strong in the land of Egypt.

57. And all the countries came into Egypt to buy corn of Joseph; because the famine was sore in all the countries.

## Genesis 42

1. And when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look at one another?

2. And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt; get you down thither, and buy for us provision from there, that we may live, and not die.

3. And ten brothers of Joseph went down to buy corn in Egypt,

4. But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brothers; for he said, Lest mischief befall him.

5. And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came; for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

6. And Joseph—he was the governor over the land, it was he that sold corn to all the people of the land; and Joseph’s brothers came, and bowed themselves down before him with the face to the earth.

7. And Joseph saw his brothers, and he recognized them; but made himself strange unto them and spoke roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.

8. And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they recognized not him.

9. And Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed concerning them, and he said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land are ye come.

10. And they said unto him, No, my lord, thy servants are only come to buy food.

11. We are all sons of one man; we are true men; thy servants have never been spies.

12. And he said unto them, No! but to see the nakedness of the land are ye come.

13. And they said, We, thy servants, are twelve brothers, sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more.

14. And Joseph said unto them, It is as I have spoken unto you, saying, Ye are spies;

15. Hereby shall ye be proved: By the life of Pharaoh, ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.

16. Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether the truth be with you; and if not, by the life of Pharaoh, ye are surely spies.

17. And he put them together into ward three days.

18. And Joseph said unto them on the third day, This do, and live; I fear God.

19. If ye be true men, let one of your brothers remain imprisoned in the house of your confinement; but ye, go, carry home what you have bought for the want of your household.

20. But your youngest brother bring unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.

21. And they said to one another, Truly we are guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.

22. And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not say unto you, thus, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? and behold, his blood also is now required.

23. And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spoke unto them by an interpreter.

24. And he turned himself away from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and spoke with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.

25. And Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way; and he did unto them thus.

26. And they loaded their asses with their corn, and departed thence.

27. And one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn: when he espied his money, for, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.

28. And he said unto his brothers, My money hath been restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?

29. And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and they told him all that had befallen them; saying,

30. The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and took us as though we were espying the country.

31. And we said unto him, We are true men; we have never been spies:

32. We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; the one is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.

33. And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men: leave one of your brothers here with me, and the food for the want of your households take ye and be gone;

34. And bring your youngest brother unto me; then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men; your brother I will give up to you, and in the land ye shall be allowed to traffic.

35. And it came to pass as they were emptying their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money was in his sack: and when they saw the bundles of their money, they and their father, they were afraid.

36. And Jacob their father said unto them, Me ye have bereaved of my children: Joseph is gone, and Simeon is gone, and Benjamin ye will take away; all these things are against me.

37. And Reuben said unto his father, thus, Two of my sons shalt thou slay, if I bring him not to thee; deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him back to thee.

38. And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he alone is left: and if mischief befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

## Genesis 43

1. And the famine was sore in the land.

2. And it came to pass, when they had completely eaten up the provisions which they had brought out of Egypt, that their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.

3. And Judah said unto him, thus, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.

4. If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food;

5. But if thou sendest him not, we will not go down; for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.

6. And Israel said, Wherefore have ye dealt so ill with me, as to tell the man that ye have yet another brother?

7. And they said, The man inquired particularly concerning us, and our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we possibly know that he would say, Bring down your brother?

8. And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, as also our little ones.

9. I will be surety for him; from my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then shall I have sinned against thee all the days.

10. For, if we had not lingered, surely we had now returned the second time.

11. And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this: take of the best products of the land in your vessels, and carry down to the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices and lotus, pistachio-nuts and almonds;

12. And twofold money take in your hand; and the money that was put back in the mouth of your sacks, you must carry back in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight;

13. Also your brother take along, and arise, go again unto the man.

14. And may God the Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away to you your other brother, and Benjamin. And I, if I am to be bereaved, let me be bereaved.

15. And the men took that present; and twofold money they took in their hand, as also Benjamin; and they rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.

16. And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the superintendent of his house, Bring these men into the house, and slay, and make ready; for with me shall these men dine at noon.

17. And the man did as Joseph had said; and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house.

18. And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s house: and they said, Because of the money that came back in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, together with our asses.

19. And they came near to the man who was appointed over Joseph’s house, and they spoke with him at the door of the house.

20. And they said, Pardon, my lord, we came down at the first time to buy food:

21. And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in its full weight; and we have brought it back in our hand.

22. And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food; we know not who hath put our money in our sacks.

23. And he said, Peace be to you, fear not; your God, and the God of your father, hath given you a treasure in your sacks; your money hath come to me. And he brought Simeon out unto them.

24. And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house; and he gave them water, and they washed their feet, and he gave provender to their asses.

25. And they made ready the present before Joseph came home at noon; for they had heard that they should eat bread there.

26. And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.

27. And he asked them after their welfare, and said, Is your old father well, of whom ye spoke? is he yet alive?

28. And they answered, Thy servant, our father, is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and prostrated themselves.

29. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spoke unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.

30. And Joseph hastened away, for his affection toward his brother became enkindled, and he sought to weep; and he entered into his chamber and wept there.

31. And he washed his face, and came out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on the bread.

32. And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves; and for the Egyptians, who did eat with him, by themselves; because the Egyptians may not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.

33. And they sat before him, the first-born according to his prior birth, and the youngest according to his youth; and the men marveled one at the other.

34. And he sent portions unto them from before him; but Benjamin’s portion exceeded the portions of all of them fivefold. And they drank, and were merry with him.

## Genesis 44

1. And he commanded the superintendent of his house, saying, Fill the sacks of these men with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in the mouth of his sack.

2. And my cup, the silver cup, thou shalt put in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and the money for his corn. And he did according to the word of Joseph which he had spoken.

3. As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.

4. They were gone out of the city, not yet far off, when Joseph said unto the superintendent of his house, Up, follow after the men; and when thou hast overtaken them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye returned evil for good?

5. Is not this out of which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.

6. And he overtook them, and he spoke unto them these same words.

7. And they said unto him, Wherefore will my lord speak such words as these? God forbid that thy servants should do any thing like this.

8. Behold the money, which we found in the mouth of our sacks, we brought back unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold?

9. With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die; and we also will be bondmen unto thy lord.

10. And he said, Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; but ye shall be blameless.

11. And they made haste, and every one of them took down his sack to the ground, and every one opened his sack.

12. And he searched, at the eldest he began, and at the youngest he left off; and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.

13. Then they rent their clothes, and every one loaded his ass, and they returned to the city.

14. And Judah and his brothers came into Joseph’s house, and he was yet there; and they fell down before him on the ground.

15. And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? knew ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?

16. And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we justify ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold we are servants unto my lord, both we, as also he in whose hand the cup was found.

17. And he said, God forbid that I should do this: the man in whose hand the cup was found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, go you up in peace unto your father.

18. Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Pardon, my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thy anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.

19. My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother.

20. And we said unto my lord, We have an old father, and a little child born in his old age; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.

21. And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set my eye upon him.

22. And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, he would die.

23. And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall not see my face any more.

24. And it came to pass, when we came up unto thy servant my father, that we told him the words of my lord.

25. And our father said, Go back and buy us a little food.

26. And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down; for we cannot see the man’s face, except our youngest brother be with us.

27. And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bore me two sons;

28. And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he hath been torn to pieces; and I have not seen him up to this time.

29. And if ye take this one also from me, and mischief befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

30. And now, when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life;

31. It will come to pass, that when he seeth that the lad is not with us, he will die: and thy servants would thus bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.

32. For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I have sinned against my father all the days.

33. Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad as bond-man to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brothers.

34. For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? I should perhaps be compelled to witness the evil which would come on my father.

## Genesis 45

1. Then could Joseph not refrain himself before all those that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there remained no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brothers.

2. And he raised his voice in weeping; and the Egyptians heard it, and the house of Pharaoh heard it.

3. And Joseph said unto his brothers, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brothers could not answer him; for they were terrified at his presence.

4. And Joseph said unto his brothers, Come near to me, I pray you; and they came near; and he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.

5. But now be not grieved, nor be angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither; for in order to preserve life did God send me before you.

6. For these two years hath the famine been already in the land; and there are yet five years, in which there will be neither ploughing nor harvesting.

7. And God hath thus sent me before you to prepare for you a permanence on the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

8. So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God; and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and a lord for all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.

9. Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus hath said thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt; come down unto me, tarry not.

10. And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children’s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that is thine.

11. And I will maintain thee there; for there are yet five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.

12. And, behold, your own eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.

13. And ye shall tell my father of all my honor in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall hasten and bring down my father hither.

14. And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.

15. And he kissed all his brothers, and wept upon them; and after that his brothers spoke with him.

16. And the report thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, Joseph’s brothers are come; and it was pleasing in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants.

17. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brothers, This do ye; load your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;

18. And take your father and your households, and come unto me; and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.

19. And thou art commanded, This do ye, take unto yourselves out of the land of Egypt wagons for your little ones, and for your wives, and take up your father, and come.

20. And do ye feel no concern on account of your household goods; for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.

21. And the children of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the command of Pharaoh; and he gave them provision for the way.

22. To all of them he gave to each changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.

23. And to his father he sent after this manner: ten asses laden with the best things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with corn and bread and other food for his father, for the journey.

24. And he accompanied his brothers on the way, and they departed: and he said unto them, Do not fall out by the way.

25. And they went out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, unto Jacob their father.

26. And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive; and that he is governor over all the land of Egypt. But his heart remained cold, for he believed them not.

27. But when they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them; and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him: the spirit of Jacob their father revived.

28. And Israel said, Enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.

## Genesis 46

1. And Israel commenced his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.

2. And God spoke unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.

3. And he said, I am God, the God of thy father; fear not to go down into Egypt; for a great nation will I make of thee there:

4. I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again; and Joseph shall put his hand upon thy eyes.

5. And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.

6. And they took their cattle and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt; Jacob, and all his seed with him:

7. His sons, and his son’s sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and all his seed he brought with him into Egypt.

8. And these are the names of the children of Israel, that came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: the first-born of Jacob, Reuben.

9. And the sons of Reuben: Chanoch, and Pallu, and Chezron, and Carmi.

10. And the sons of Simeon: Yemuel, and Yamin, and Ohad, and Yachin, and Zochar, and Shaul the son of the Canaanitish woman.

11. And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kehath, and Merari.

12. And the sons of Judah: ‘Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerach; but ‘Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan, and the sons of Perez were Chezron and Chamul.

13. And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah, and Yob, and Shimron.

14. And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Yachleel.

15. These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore unto Jacob in Padan-aram, with Dinah his daughter: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.

16. And the sons of Gad: Ziphyon, and Chaggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, ‘Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.

17. And the sons of Asher: Yimnah, and Yishvah, and Yishvi, and Beriah, and Serach their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Cheber, and Malkiel.

18. These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and she bore these unto Jacob, sixteen souls.

19. The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin.

20. And there were born unto Joseph in the land of Egypt Menasseh and Ephraim, whom Assenath the daughter of Poti-phera’, the priest of On, bore unto him.

21. And the sons of Benjamin: Bela’, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Echi, and Rosh, Muppim and Chuppim, and Ard.

22. These are the sons of Rachel, that were born to Jacob: in all fourteen souls.

23. And the son of Dan: Chushim.

24. And the sons of Naphtali: Yachzeel, and Guni, and Yezer, and Shillem.

25. These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bore these unto Jacob, in all seven souls.

26. All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, that came out of his loins, besides the wives of Jacob’s sons, were in all sixty and six souls.

27. And the sons of Joseph, who were born him in Egypt, were two souls; all the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were seventy.

28. And Judah he sent before him unto Joseph, to direct him beforehand unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.

29. And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and when he obtained sight of him, he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

30. And Israel said unto Joseph, Let me die now, since I have seen thy face, that thou art yet alive.

31. And Joseph said unto his brothers, and unto his father’s house, I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brothers and my father’s house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;

32. And the men are shepherds, for they have been owners of cattle; and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, they have brought along.

33. And it shall come to pass, if Pharaoh should have you called, and say, What is your occupation?

34. That ye shall say, Owners of cattle have thy servants been from our youth even until now, both we, as also our fathers; in order that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.

## Genesis 47

1. Then came Joseph and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brothers, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.

2. And he took some of his brothers, five men, and presented them before Pharaoh.

3. And Pharaoh said unto his brothers, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, as also our fathers.

4. They said moreover unto Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land are we come; because there is no pasture for the flocks of thy servants, for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan; and now let thy servants dwell, we pray thee, in the land of Goshen.

5. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, thus, Thy father and thy brothers are come unto thee:

6. The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land let thy father and brothers dwell; let them dwell in the land of Goshen; and if thou knowest that there are among them men of activity, then appoint them rulers over my cattle.

7. And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and placed him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

8. And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?

9. And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.

10. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.

11. And Joseph assigned places of residence for his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Ra’meses, as Pharaoh had commanded.

12. And Joseph supplied his father, and his brothers, and all his father’s household, with bread, in proportion to their families.

13. And there was no bread in all the land: for the famine was very sore; and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.

14. And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.

15. And when the money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread, for why should we die in thy presence, since the money is all gone?

16. And Joseph said, Give up your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if the money be all gone.

17. And they brought their cattle unto Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks of sheep, and for the herds of cattle, and for the asses; and he supplied them with bread for all their cattle for that year.

18. And when that year was ended, they came unto him in the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money with our herds of cattle hath entirely passed into the possession of my lord; there is naught left in sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our land.

19. Wherefore shall we die before thy eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread; and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh; and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not rendered desolate.

20. And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh’s.

21. And as for the people, he removed them to the cities, from one end of the borders of Egypt to the other end thereof.

22. Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them by Pharaoh, and they ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them: therefore they did not sell their land.

23. Then said Joseph unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and sow ye the land.

24. And it shall come to pass in the harvest times, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh; and four parts shall be your own, for the seed of the field, and for your food, and for those belonging to your households, and for food for your little ones.

25. And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us but find grace in the eyes of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.

26. And Joseph made it a statute unto this day over the land of Egypt, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests alone became not Pharaoh’s.

27. And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.

28. And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: and the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred forty and seven years.

29. And when the time of Israel drew near that he was to die, he sent to call his son Joseph, and said unto him, if now I have found grace in thy eyes, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh; and deal with me in kindness and truth; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt.

30. But when I shall lie with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.

31. And he said, Swear unto me; and he swore unto him; and Israel bowed himself upon the head of the bed.

## Genesis 48

1. And it came to pass after these things, that some one said to Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick; and he took his two sons with him, Menasseh and Ephraim.

2. And some one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph is coming unto thee; and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.

3. And Jacob said unto Joseph, God, the Almighty, appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,

4. And he said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and I will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.

5. And now thy two sons, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt, before I came unto thee into Egypt, shall be mine; Ephraim and Menasseh shall be unto me as Reuben and Simeon.

6. And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, after the name of their brothers shall they be called in their inheritance.

7. And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan on the way, when yet there was some distance to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there on the way of Ephrath, the same is Beth-lechem.

8. And Israel perceived the sons of Joseph, and said, Who are these?

9. And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.

10. Now the eyes of Israel were dim through age, he could not see; and he brought them near unto him, and he kissed them, and embraced them.

11. And Israel said unto Joseph, To see thy face I had not hoped; and lo, God hath shown me also thy seed.

12. And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.

13. And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left, and Menasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right, and brought them near unto him.

14. And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Menasseh’s head; he laid his hands wittingly; although Menasseh was the first-born.

15. And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who fed me from my first being unto this day,

16. The angel who redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be called on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.

17. And when Joseph saw that his father would lay his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he took hold of his father’s hand, to remove it from the head of Ephraim unto the head of Menasseh.

18. And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father; for this is the first-born, put thy right hand upon his head.

19. And his father refused, and said, I know, my son, I know, he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.

20. And he blessed them that day, saying, With thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and Menasseh: and so he set Ephraim before Menasseh.

21. And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die; but God will be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers

22. Moreover I have given unto thee one portion above thy brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Emorite with my sword and with my bow.

## Genesis 49

1. And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.

2. Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.

3. Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength; the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power should be thine.

4. Unstable as water, thou shalt not have the excellence; because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed; then defiledst thou the one who ascended my couch.

5. Simeon and Levi are brethren; weapons of violence are their swords.

6. Into their secret shall my soul not come; unto their assembly my spirit shall not be united; for in their anger they slew the man, and in their self-will they lamed the ox.

7. Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce; and their wrath, for it is cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.

8. Judah, thou art the one thy brothers shall praise, thy hand shall be on the neck of thy enemies; thy father’s children shall bow down unto thee.

9. Like a lion’s whelp, O Judah, from the prey, my son, thou risest: he stoopeth down, he croucheth as a lion, and as a lioness, who shall rouse him up?

10. The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet; until Shiloh come, and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.

11. He bindeth unto the vine his foal, and to the vine-branch his ass’s colt; he washeth his garments in wine, and in the blood of grapes his clothes;

12. His eyes shall be red from wine, and his teeth white from milk.

13. Zebulun shall dwell at the margin of the seas; and he shall be at the haven of ships; and his border shall be near to Zidon.

14. Issachar is a strong-boned ass, couching down between the stables.

15. And when he saw the resting-place that it was good, and the land that it was pleasant, he bent his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.

16. Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

17. Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder on the path, that biteth the horse in the heels, so that his rider falleth backward.

18. For thy salvation, I hope, O Lord.

19. Gad, troops will band against him; but he shall wound their heel.

20. Out of Asher cometh fat bread, and he shall yield royal dainties.

21. Naphtali is like a fleet hind; he bringeth pleasant words.

22. Joseph is a fruitful bough, a fruitful bough by a spring; the branches of which run over the wall.

23. And they embittered his life, and they shot at him, and they hated him, the men of the arrows.

24. But his bow abode in strength, and his arm and his hands remained firm; from the hands of the mighty God of Jacob, from there thou becamest the shepherd, the stone of Israel.

25. From the God of thy father, who will help thee; and from the Almighty, who will bless thee, with blessings of heaven above, with blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath, with blessings of the breasts, and of the womb;

26. With the blessings of thy father that have excelled the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: these shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separated from his brothers.

27. Benjamin shall be as a wolf that rendeth: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at evening he shall divide the spoil.

28. All these are the tribes of Israel, twelve in number; and this is what their father spoke unto them, and wherewith he blessed them; every one according to his proper blessing blessed he them.

29. And he charged them and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people; bury me near my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,

30. In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which field Abraham bought of Ephron the Hittite, for a possession as a burying-place,

31. (There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah,)

32. Purchasing the field and the cave that is therein from the children of Heth.

33. And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed; and he departed this life, and was gathered unto his people.

## Genesis 50

1. And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.

2. And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.

3. And they fulfilled for him forty days: for so they fulfill the days of those that are embalmed; and the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.

4. And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,

5. My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die; in my grave, which I have dug for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me: now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and I will bury my father, and return again.

6. And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, as he hath made thee swear.

7. And Joseph went up to bury his father, and there went up with him all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,

8. And all the house of Joseph, and his brothers, and his father’s house; only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left behind in the land of Goshen.

9. And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen; and the encampment was very great.

10. And they came to the thrashing-floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and they held there a great and very sore lamentation; and he made for his father a mourning of seven days.

11. And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the thrashing-floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians; wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizrayim, which is beyond the Jordan.

12. And his sons did unto him according as he had commanded them;

13. And his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which field Abraham bought for a possession, as a burying-place, of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.

14. And Joseph returned unto Egypt, he, and his brothers, and all that were gone up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.

15. And when Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, Peradventure Joseph may now hate us: and then he would certainly requite us all the evil which we have done unto him.

16. And they sent word unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before his death, saying,

17. So shall ye say unto Joseph, O forgive, I pray thee, the trespass of thy brothers, and their sin; for evil have they done unto thee: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father; and Joseph wept when they spoke unto him.

18. And his brothers also went and fell down before him; and they said, Behold, we will be thy servants.

19. And Joseph said unto them, Fear not; for am I in the place of God?

20. But as for you, though ye thought evil against me, God meant it unto good; in order to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save alive a numerous people.

21. Now therefore fear ye not, I will support you, and your little ones; and he comforted them, and spoke kindly unto them.

22. And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house; and Joseph lived one hundred and ten years.

23. And Joseph saw of Ephraim children of the third generation; the children also of Machir the son of Menasseh were brought up upon Joseph’s knees.

24. And Joseph said unto his brothers, I shall die; but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land unto the land which he hath sworn to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

25. And Joseph caused the children of Israel to swear, saying, God will surely visit you, and then shall ye carry up my bones from here.

26. So Joseph died, being one hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
