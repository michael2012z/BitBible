## Proverbs 1

1. The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, the king of Israel:

2. To know wisdom and instruction; to comprehend the sayings of understanding;

3. To accept the instruction of intelligence, righteousness, and justice, and equity;

4. To give to the simple prudence, to the youth knowledge and discretion.

5. The wise will hear, and will increase his information; and the man of understanding will obtain wise counsels:

6. To understand a proverb, and a sage sentence; the words of the wise, and their riddles.

7. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: wisdom and instruction fools alone despise.

8. Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, and cast not off the teaching of thy mother;

9. For a wreath of grace are they unto thy head, and chains for thy throat.

10. My son, if sinners wish to entice thee, consent thou not.

11. If they should say, Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us watch in concealment for the uselessly innocent;

12. We will swallow them up like the grave alive; and the men of integrity, as those that go down into the pit;

13. We shall find all kinds of precious wealth, we will fill our houses with booty;

14. Thy lot must thou cast in our midst; one purse shall be for us all:

15. My son, walk not thou on the way with them; withhold thy foot from their path;

16. For their feet run after evil, and they make haste to shed blood.

17. For uselessly is the net spread out before the eyes of every winged bird:

18. While they lie in wait for their own blood; they watch in concealment for their own lives.

19. So are the paths of every one that is greedy after unlawful gain; it taketh away the life of those that own it.

20. Wisdom crieth loudly without; in the public places she uttereth her voice;

21. At the corner of noisy streets she calleth, at the entrances of gates; in the city she sayeth her speeches:

22. How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners take their delight in scorning, and fools hate knowledge?

23. Turn back to my admonition: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.

24. Whereas I called, and ye refused; I stretched out my hand, and no man was attentive;

25. And ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would not accept my admonition:

26. Therefore I also will truly laugh at your calamity; I will deride you when your terror cometh;

27. When your terror cometh like the tempest-cloud, and your calamity hasteneth like a whirlwind; when there come upon you distress and affliction.

28. Then will they call me, but I will not answer; they will seek me earnestly, but they shall not find me;

29. For the reason that they hated knowledge, and the fear of the Lord they did not choose;

30. That they would not attend to my counsel: that they rejected all my admonition.

31. Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and from their own counsels shall they be satisfied.

32. For the defection of the simple will slay them, and the prosperity of fools will cause them to be lost.

33. But he that hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be at rest from the dread of evil.

## Proverbs 2

1. My son, if thou wouldst but accept my words, and treasure up my commandments with thee;

2. To let thy ear listen unto wisdom: if thou wouldst incline thy heart to understanding.

3. For if thou wilt call after intelligence; if after understanding thou wilt lift up thy voice;

4. If thou wilt seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures:

5. Then wilt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and the knowledge of God wilt thou find.

6. For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth come knowledge and understanding.

7. He treasureth up sound wisdom for the righteous, as a shield to those that walk in integrity:

8. That men may keep the paths of justice; and the way of his pious servants doth he guard.

9. Then wilt thou understand righteousness, and justice, and equity: yea, every track of goodness.

10. For wisdom will enter thy heart, and knowledge will be pleasant unto thy soul;

11. Discretion will watch over thee, understanding will keep thee;

12. To deliver thee from the way of the bad, from the man that speaketh perverse things;

13. From those who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;

14. Who rejoice to do evil, who are delighted in the perverseness of the bad;

15. Who as regardeth their paths are crooked, and froward in their tracks.

16. To deliver thee from the adulteress, from the alien woman that useth flattering speeches;

17. That forsaketh the friend of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.

18. For she sinketh unto deathâ€”her house, and unto the departed lead her tracks.

19. All that come unto her return not again, and they will not reach the paths of life.

20. In order that thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and observe the paths of the righteous.

21. For the upright will dwell on the earth, and the perfect will be left remaining on it.

22. But the wicked will be cut off from the earth, and the treacherous shall be plucked up therefrom.

## Proverbs 3

1. My son, forget not my teaching, and let thy heart keep my commandments;

2. For length of days, and years of life, and peace, will they increase unto thee.

3. Let kindness and truth not forsake thee; bind them about thy throat; write them upon the table of thy heart:

4. So shalt thou find grace and good favor in the eyes of God and man.

5. Trust in the Lord with all thy heart: and upon thy own understanding do not rely.

6. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he will make level thy paths.

7. Be not wise in thy own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil.

8. It will be healing to thy body, and marrow to thy bones.

9. Honor the Lord with thy wealth, and with the first-fruits of all thy products:

10. So shall thy storehouses be filled with plenty, and with new wine shall thy presses overflow.

11. The correction of the Lord, my son, do not despise; and feel no loathing for his admonition;

12. Because whomever the Lord loveth he admonisheth; and as a father who delighteth in his son.

13. Happy the man that hath found wisdom, and the man that acquireth understanding.

14. For the obtaining of her is better than the obtaining of silver, and better than fine gold is her product.

15. She is more precious than pearls; and all the things thou valuest are not equal unto her.

16. Length of days is in her right hand: in her left are riches and honor.

17. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.

18. A tree of life is she to those that lay hold on her: and every one that firmly graspeth her will be made happy.

19. The Lord hath through wisdom founded the earth: he hath established the heavens through understanding.

20. By his knowledge were the depths split open, and the skies drop down the dew.

21. My son, let them not be removed from thy eyes; keep before thee sound wisdom and discretion:

22. And they will be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy throat.

23. Then wilt thou walk in safety on thy way, and thy foot will not strike against aught:

24. When thou layest thyself down, thou shalt feel no dread; and as thou liest down, thy sleep shall be pleasant.

25. Thou needest not to be afraid of sudden dread, neither of the unlooked-for tempest over the wicked, when it cometh.

26. For the Lord will be thy confidence, and he will guard thy foot from being caught.

27. Withhold not a benefit from him who is deserving it, when it is in the power of thy hand to do it.

28. Say not unto thy neighbor, Go, and return, and tomorrow will I give: when thou hast it by thee.

29. Contrive not against thy neighbor any evil, when he dwelleth in safety with thee.

30. Quarrel not with any man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.

31. Envy not the man of violence, and choose none of his ways.

32. For the froward is an abomination to the Lord; but with the upright is his good-will.

33. The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked; but the habitation of the righteous will he bless.

34. If it concern the scornful he will himself render them a scorn; but unto the lowly doth he give grace.

35. The wise shall inherit glory; but fools shall obtain disgrace as their portion.

## Proverbs 4

1. Hear, ye children, the correction of a father, and attend to know understanding.

2. For good information do I give you: my teaching must ye not forsake.

3. For I was a son unto my father, a tender and an only child before my mother.

4. And he instructed me, and said unto me, Let thy heart grasp firmly my words: observe my commandments and live.

5. Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding: forget not, and depart not from the sayings of my mouth.

6. Forsake her not, and she will watch over thee: love her, and she will keep thee.

7. The beginning of wisdom is, Acquire wisdom: and with all thy acquisition acquire understanding.

8. Hold her in high esteem, and she will exalt thee: she will bring thee to honor, when thou embracest her.

9. She will give to thy head a wreath of grace: a crown of ornament will she deliver to thee.

10. Hear, O my son, and accept my sayings: and they will increase unto thee the years of life.

11. In the way of wisdom have I instructed thee: I have led thee in the tracks of uprightness.

12. When thou walkest, thy step shall not be narrowed; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.

13. Lay fast hold of correction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.

14. Enter not into the path of the wicked, and step not on the way of the bad.

15. Avoid it, pass not through by it, turn off from it, and pass away.

16. For they sleep not, except they have done evil, and their sleep is robbed away, unless they cause some to stumble.

17. For they eat the bread of wickedness; and the wine of violence do they drink.

18. But the path of the righteous is as the early morning light, that shineth more and more brightly until the height of noonday.

19. The way of the wicked is like darkness: they know not against what they stumble.

20. My son, attend to my words, unto my sayings incline thy ear.

21. Let them not slip away from thy eyes: guard them in the midst of thy heart.

22. For they are life unto every one of those that find them, and to all his body a healing.

23. Above all that is to be guarded, keep thy heart, for out of it are the issues of life.

24. Remove from thee frowardness of mouth; and perverseness of lips put away far from thee.

25. Let thy eyes look right forward, and let thy eyelids see straight out before thee.

26. Balance well the track of thy foot, and let all thy ways be firmly right.

27. Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.

## Proverbs 5

1. My son, attend unto my wisdom; to my understanding incline thou thy ear:

2. That thou mayest observe discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.

3. For as of fine honey drop the lips of an adulterous woman, and smoother than oil is her palate;

4. But her end is bitter as wormwood, it is sharp as a two-edged sword.

5. Her feet go down to death, her steps take firm hold on the nether world:

6. So that she cannot balance the path of life; her tracks are unsteady, and she knoweth it not.

7. And now, O ye children, hearken unto me, and depart not from the sayings of my mouth.

8. Remove far from her thy way, and come not nigh to the door of her house;

9. That thou mayest not give up unto others thy vigor, and thy years unto the cruel;

10. That strangers may not satisfy themselves with thy strength, and with thy exertions, in the house of an alien:

11. While thou moanest at thy end, when thy flesh and thy body are coming to their end,

12. And thou sayest, How have I hated correction, and how hath my heart rejected reproof;

13. While I hearkened not to the voice of my instructors, and to my teachers I inclined not my ear;

14. But little more was wanting, and I had been in all kinds of unhappiness in the midst of the congregation and assembly.

15. Drink water out of thy own cistern, and running waters out of thy own well.

16. So will thy springs overflow abroad; and in the open streets will be thy rivulets of water;

17. They will be thy own only, and not those of strangers with thee.

18. Thy fountain will be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth,â€”

19. The lovely gazelle and the graceful chamois: let her bosom satisfy thee abundantly at all times; with her love be thou ravished continually.

20. And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with an adulteress, and embrace the bosom of an alien woman?

21. For before the eyes of the Lord are the ways of man, and all his tracks doth he weigh in the balance.

22. His own iniquities will truly catch the wicked, and with the cords of his sin will he be held firmly.

23. He will indeed die for want of correction; and through the abundance of his folly will he sink into error.

## Proverbs 6

1. My son, If thou hast become surety for thy friend, if thou hast struck thy hand for a stranger;

2. If thou art ensnared through the words of thy mouth, if thou art caught through the words of thy mouth:

3. Then do this by all means, my son, and deliver thyself, because thou art come into the power of thy friend, Go hasten to him, and urge thy friend.

4. Grant not any sleep to thy eyes, nor slumber to thy eyelids.

5. Deliver thyself as a roebuck from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.

6. Go to the ant, thou sluggard; look on her ways, and become wise.

7. She, that hath no prince, officer, or ruler,

8. Provideth in the summer her provision, gathereth in harvest-time her food.

9. How long, O sluggard, wilt thou lie down? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?

10. "A little more sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands in lying down;"

11. But then will thy poverty come like a rover, and thy want as a man armed with a shield.

12. A Godless person is a man of injustice, who walketh with a distorted mouth.

13. He blinketh with his eyes, he scrapeth with his feet, he pointeth with his fingers;

14. Perverseness is in his heart, he contriveth evil at all times; he scattereth abroad discord.

15. Therefore shall suddenly come his calamity: unawares shalt he be broken without a remedy.

16. Six things there are which the Lord hateth; and seven are an abomination unto his spirit:

17. Haughty eyes, a tongue of falsehood, and hands that shed innocent blood,

18. A heart that contriveth plans of injustice, feet that hasten to run after evil,

19. A false witness that eagerly uttereth lies, and him that scattereth abroad discord among brethren.

20. Keep, O my son, the commandment of thy father, and reject not the teaching of thy mother:

21. Bind them upon thy heart continually, tie them about thy throat.

22. When thou walkest, it shall lead thee; when thou liest down, it shall watch over thee; and when thou art awake, it shall converse with thee.

23. For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light; and the way of life are the admonitions of correction:

24. To guard thee against a bad woman, from the flattery of an alien tongue.

25. Covet not her beauty in thy heart, and let her not conquer thee with her eyelids.

26. For by means of a harlot one is brought down to the last loaf of bread: and an adulterous woman will even hunt for the precious life,

27. Can a man gather up fire in his lap, and shall his clothes not be burnt?

28. Can a man walk along upon hot coals, and shall his feet not be burnt?

29. So it is with him that goeth in to his neighborâ€™s wife: no one that toucheth her shall remain unpunished.

30. Men do not despise the thief, if he steal, to gratify his craving when he is hungry:

31. And if he be found, he must pay sevenfold; all the wealth his house must he give.

32. But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh sense: he that is the destroyer of his soul, will alone do this.

33. Plague and disgrace will he meet with; and his reproach will not be blotted out.

34. For jealousy is the fury of a husband, and he will not spare on the day of vengeance.

35. He will not regard the appearance of any ransom; and he will not be content, though thou give ever so many bribes.

## Proverbs 7

1. My son, observe my sayings, and my commandments must thou treasure up with thee.

2. Observe my commandments, and live: and my teaching as the apple of thy eyes.

3. Bind them around thy fingers, write them upon the table of thy heart.

4. Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:

5. That they may keep thee from an adulterous woman, from an alien that useth flattering speeches.

6. For through the window of my house, through my lattice did I once look out,

7. And I beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a lad void of sense;

8. He was passing through the market-place near her corner; and he stepped along on the way to her house,

9. In the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the depth of the night and when it was dark:

10. And, behold, a woman came to meet him with the attire of a harlot, and obdurate of heart.

11. (She is noisy and ungovernable; in her house her feet never rest;

12. At one time she is in the street, at another in the open places, and near every corner doth she lurk,)

13. And she caught hold of him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face she said to him,

14. "I had bound myself to bring peace-offerings; this day have I paid my vows:

15. Therefore am I come forth to meet thee, to seek thy presence diligently, and I have found thee.

16. With tapestry coverings have I decked my bed, with embroidered coverlids of the fine linen of Egypt.

17. I have sprinkled my couch with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

18. Come, let us indulge in love until the morning: let us delight ourselves with dalliances.

19. For the man is not in his house, he is gone on a journey a great way off:

20. The bag of money hath he taken with him, by the day of the new-moon festival only will he come home."

21. She seduced him by the abundance of her reasoning: by the flattery of her lips she misguided him.

22. He followed after her suddenly, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, and as in fetters to his correction, the fool:

23. Till an arrow cleaveth through his liver; as a bird hasteneth into the snare, and knoweth not that it is done to take his life.

24. And now, O children, hearken unto me, and listen to the sayings of my mouth.

25. Let not thy heart turn aside to her ways, do not go astray on her paths.

26. For many deadly wounded hath she caused to fall: yea, very numerous are all those slain by her.

27. The ways to the nether world is her house leading down to the chambers of death.

## Proverbs 8

1. Behold, wisdom calleth, and understanding sendeth forth her voice,

2. On the top of high places, by the wayside, at the house where there are many paths doth she place herself.

3. Alongside of gates, at the opening of the city, at the entrance of the town-doors doth she call loudly,

4. Unto you, O men, I call, and my voice goeth forth to the sons of men,

5. Learn, O ye simple, to understand prudence: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.

6. Hear! for of noble things will I speak; and the opening of my lips shall be of what is equitable.

7. For truth uttereth my palate ever, and the abomination of my lips is wickedness.

8. In righteousness are all the sayings of my mouth, there is in them nothing crooked or perverse.

9. They are all evident to the man of understanding, and correct to those that have obtained knowledge.

10. Accept my correction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.

11. For wisdom is better than pearls; and all the things that men wish for are not equal to her.

12. I wisdom dwell with prudence, and the knowledge of discreet thoughts do I discover.

13. The fear of the Lord is to hate evil, pride and arrogance, and the evil way: and the mouth of perverseness do I hate.

14. Mine are counsel and sound wisdom: I am understanding; mine is might.

15. Through me do kings reign, and chieftains give decrees in righteousness.

16. Through me do princes rule, and the nobles, even all the judges of the earth.

17. I indeed love those that love me: and those that seek me earnestly shall find me.

18. Riches and honor are with me, yea, enduring wealth and righteousness.

19. My fruit is better than gold, and than fine gold; and my products, than choice silver.

20. On the road of righteousness do I walk firmly, in the midst the paths of justice:

21. That I may cause those that love me to inherit a lasting possession; and their treasures will I fill

22. The Lord created me as the beginning of his way, the first of his works from the commencement,

23. From eternity was I appointed chief, from the beginning, from the earliest times of the earth.

24. When there were yet no depths, was I brought forth; when there were yet no springs laden heavily with water.

25. Before the mountains were yet sunk down, before the hills was I brought forth:

26. While as yet he had not made the land and open fields, nor the chief of the dust of the world.

27. When he prepared the heavens, I was there; when he drew a circle over the face of the deep;

28. When he fastened the skies above; when the springs of the deep became strong;

29. When he assigned to the sea his decree, that the waters should not transgress his order: when he established firmly the foundations of the earth:

30. Then was I near him, as a nursling: and I was day by day his delights, playing before him at all times;

31. Playing in the world, his earth; and having my delights with the sons of men.

32. And now, O children of men, hearken unto me! for happy those that observe my ways.

33. Hear correction, and be wise, and reject it not.

34. Happy is the man that hearkeneth unto me, watching day by day at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.

35. For he who findeth me findeth life, and he obtaineth favor from the Lord.

36. But he that sinneth against me doth violence to his own soul: all those that hate me love death.

## Proverbs 9

1. Wisdom hath built her house; she hath hewn out her seven pillars;

2. She hath killed her cattle; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also set in order her table.

3. She hath sent forth her maidens: she inviteth her guests upon the top of the highest places of the town.

4. Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that is void of sense, she saith to him,

5. "Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.

6. Forsake simplicity, and live; and go onward on the way of understanding.

7. He that correcteth a scorner acquireth for himself abuse; and he that reproveth the wicked getteth himself a blemish.

8. Do not correct a scorner, lest he hate thee: reprove a wise man, and he will love thee.

9. Give to the wise instruction, and he will become yet wiser: impart knowledge to the righteous, and he will increase his information.

10. The commencement of wisdom is the fear of the Lord; and the knowledge of the Most Holy One is understanding.

11. For through me shall thy days be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased unto thee.

12. If thou art become wise, thou art wise for thyself; but if thou art a scorner, thou alone wilt have to bear it."

13. The woman of folly is noisy: she is simple, and knoweth not what to do.

14. And she sitteth at the door of her house, upon a chair in the high places of the town.

15. To call the wayfarers who go straight forward on their paths.

16. Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither; and as for him that is void of sense, she saith to him,

17. "Stolen waters are sweet, and bread of secrecy is pleasant."

18. But he knoweth not that the departed are there; that in the depths of the nether world are her guests.
