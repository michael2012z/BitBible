# Isaiah

## Isaiah 1

1. The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

2. Give heed, O heavens, and hear, O earth! For Jehovah has spoken: I have nourished and brought up children, but they have rebelled against Me.

3. The ox knows his owner, and the ass his masters manger, but Israel does not know; My people have not discerned.

4. Woe, sinful nation, a people heavy with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children who corrupt! They have forsaken Jehovah; they have scorned the Holy One of Israel. They are estranged backward.

5. Why will you be stricken any more? Will you rebel more and more? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart is faint.

6. From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it; only wounds and bruises and fresh stripes; they have not been closed nor bound up, nor has it been softened with oil.

7. Your land is a desolation; your cities burned with fire. Strangers devour your land before you; and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.

8. And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, like a hut in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.

9. Except Jehovah of Hosts had left us a small remnant, we would be as Sodom; we would be as Gomorrah.

10. Hear the Word of Jehovah, you rulers of Sodom. Give heed to the Law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.

11. What good to Me are your many sacrifices, says Jehovah? I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of well-fed cattle; nor do I delight in the blood of bulls, of lambs, or he goats.

12. When you come to appear before Me, who has required this at your hand, to trample My courts?

13. Bring no more vain sacrifices; its incense is an abomination to Me. I cannot endure the new moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies, and the wicked festivals.

14. My soul hates your new moons and your appointed feasts. They are a burden to Me; I am weary of bearing them.

15. And when you spread out your hands, I will hide My eyes from you. Even though you multiply prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood.

16. Wash yourselves, purify yourselves. Put away the evil of your doings from My eyes; stop doing evil.

17. Learn to do good, seek justice, set straight the oppressor, judge for the orphan, plead for the widow.

18. Come now and let us reason together, says Jehovah: Though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.

19. If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land.

20. But if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.

21. Oh how the faithful city has become a harlot! It was full of justice; righteousness lodged in it; but now, murderers!

22. Your silver has become dross; your wine is diluted with water.

23. Your rulers are rebellious and companions of thieves. Everyone loves a bribe, and pursues rewards. They do not judge for the orphan, nor does the cause of the widow come before them.

24. Therefore says the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah! I will be eased of My adversaries, and avenge Myself of My enemies.

25. And I will turn back My hand upon you, and refine your dross, as with lye, and remove all your alloy.

26. And I will return your judges as at the first; and your advisers, as at the beginning; then you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city.

27. Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her returning ones with righteousness.

28. And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together. And those who forsake Jehovah shall be consumed.

29. For they shall be ashamed of the mighty trees which you desired; and you shall be ashamed of the gardens that you have chosen.

30. For you shall be like a mighty tree whose leaf fades, and like a garden that has no water.

31. And the strong shall be as tinder, and the work as a spark; and they both shall burn together; and no one shall quench them.

## Isaiah 2

1. The Word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:

2. And it shall come to pass in the end times, that the mountain of the house of Jehovah shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.

3. And many people shall go and say, Come and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob. And He will teach us His ways, and we will walk in His paths. For out of Zion the Law shall go forth, and the Word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.

4. And He shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people. And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, nor shall they learn war anymore.

5. O house of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.

6. For You have forsaken Your people, the house of Jacob, because they have been consecrated from the east, and are fortunetellers like the Philistines, and they clap hands in worship with children of foreigners.

7. Their land is also filled with silver and gold. There is no end to their treasures. And their land is full of horses, neither is there any end to their chariots.

8. Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.

9. People prostrate themselves, men bow low; therefore You do not forgive them.

10. Enter into the rock and hide in the dust from the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of His majesty.

11. The lofty eyes of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down; but Jehovah, He alone, shall be exalted in that day.

12. For the day of Jehovah of Hosts shall come upon all the proud and lofty ones, and upon all that is lifted up; and it shall be brought low;

13. and upon all the cedars of Lebanon, high and lifted up; and upon all the oaks of Bashan;

14. and upon all the high mountains; and upon all the lifted up hills;

15. and upon every tall tower; and upon every fortified wall;

16. and upon all the ships of Tarshish; and upon all desirable craft.

17. And the pride of man shall be bowed down; and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low; and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.

18. And the idols shall completely pass away.

19. And they shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth, for the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of His majesty; when He rises up to make the earth tremble.

20. In that day a man shall throw his idols of silver and gold, which they made each man to bow down to, to the moles and to the bats;

21. to go into the crevices of the rocks, and into the clefts of the cliffs, from the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of His majesty; when He rises up to make the earth tremble.

22. Leave off from such a man, whose breath is in his nostril; for how is he to be accounted?

## Isaiah 3

1. For behold, the Lord Jehovah of Hosts takes away the support and the staff from Jerusalem and from Judah; the whole support of bread and the whole support of water;

2. the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge and the prophet, and the diviner, and the elder;

3. the commander of fifty and the honorable man; the counselor and the skilled magician; and the expert enchanter.

4. And I will give youth to be their rulers, and wanton children shall rule over them.

5. And the people shall be oppressed, man against man, every man by his neighbor. The youth will be insolent against the elder, and the dishonorable against the honorable.

6. When a man shall take hold of his brother, in his fathers house, saying, You have clothing! Come, you be our ruler; let this ruin be under your power.

7. In that day he shall lift himself up and say, I cannot be one who binds up; for there is neither bread nor clothing in my house; do not make me a ruler of the people.

8. For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen; because their tongue and their deeds are rebellion toward Jehovah and against the eyes of His glory.

9. The expression of their faces witnesses against them; they have declared their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to their soul! For they have recompensed evil upon themselves.

10. Say to the righteous that it is well; for they shall eat of the fruit of their doings.

11. Woe to the wicked! For the evil, the recompense of his hand, shall be done unto him.

12. As for My people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O My people, those leading you cause you to go astray, and they swallow the way of your paths.

13. Jehovah stands up to plead His case, and stands up to judge the peoples.

14. Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of His people, and their rulers. For you have eaten up the vineyard, the plunder of the poor is in your houses.

15. What do you mean that you crush My people, and grind the faces of the poor? says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts.

16. Furthermore Jehovah says, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched out necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and make a tinkling with their feet;

17. therefore Jehovah will attach scabs to the top of the head of the daughters of Zion; and Jehovah will lay bare their secret parts.

18. In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, and their headbands, and their crescents of the moon,

19. the pendants, and the bracelets, and the veils;

20. the turbans, and the leg ornaments, and the sashes, and the perfume boxes, and the amulets;

21. the rings and nose jewels;

22. the festal apparel and the outer garments; and the mantles, and the purses;

23. the mirrors and the fine linen; and the turbans and the veils.

24. And it shall be, instead of a smell of perfume, there shall be an odor of decay. And instead of a belt, a rope. And instead of well set hair, baldness. And instead of a rich robe, a girding of sackcloth; and branding instead of beauty.

25. Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty in the war.

26. And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall sit desolate on the ground.

## Isaiah 4

1. And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothing; only let us be called by your name, to take away our reproach.

2. In that day shall the Branch of Jehovah be beautiful and honorable, and the fruit of the earth excellent and glorious for those who have escaped from Israel.

3. And it shall come to pass that he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even everyone who is recorded among the living in Jerusalem;

4. when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from its midst by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.

5. And Jehovah will create over all the foundation of Mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a canopy.

6. And there shall be a booth for shade by day from the heat, and for a refuge and a shelter from storm and rain.

## Isaiah 5

1. Now I will sing to my Beloved a song of my Beloved concerning His vineyard. My Beloved has a vineyard on a very fruitful hill.

2. And He fenced it, and cleared out its stones, and planted it with choice vines, and built a tower in its midst, and hewed out a winepress in it; and He looked for it to produce grapes, but it produced rotten grapes.

3. And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, please judge between Me and My vineyard.

4. What more could have been done to my vineyard that I have not done in it? Why then, when I looked for it to yield grapes, did it yield rotten grapes?

5. And now I will tell you what I will do to My vineyard; I will take away its hedge, and it shall be burned; and break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down;

6. and I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor dug; but briers and thorns shall come up. And I will command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.

7. For the vineyard of Jehovah of Hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are His pleasant plant. He looked for justice, but behold bloodshed; for righteousness, but behold an outcry!

8. Woe to those who join house to house, laying field to field, until there is no more space for you to dwell alone in the midst of the earth!

9. Jehovah of Hosts said in my ears, Truly many big and pleasant houses shall be laid waste, without inhabitant.

10. Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah.

11. Woe to those who rise up early in the morning to pursue strong drink; remaining until the evening while wine inflames them!

12. And the lute, and the harp, the tambourine, and pipe, and wine, are at their feasts; but they do not regard the work of Jehovah, neither do they give attention to the work of His hands.

13. For this My people have gone into captivity without knowledge, and their honorable men into famine, and their multitude dried up with thirst.

14. Therefore Sheol has enlarged itself, and opened its mouth without measure; and their glory, and their multitude, and their tumult, and he who exults, shall go down into it.

15. And people are prostrated, and great men are brought low and the eyes of the haughty are brought low.

16. But Jehovah of Hosts is exalted in justice, and the Mighty God, the Holy One, is sanctified in righteousness.

17. Then shall the lambs feed in their pastures, and the waste places of the fat ones shall sojourners eat.

18. Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin with cart ropes;

19. who say, Let Him hurry and hasten His work, so that we may see it; and let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, so that we may know it!

20. Woe to those who call evil good and good evil; who put darkness for light and light for darkness; who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!

21. Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and understanding in their own sight!

22. Woe to those mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mix strong drink;

23. who justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away justice from the righteous!

24. Therefore, as the fire devours the stubble, and the flame consumes the chaff, so their root shall be like rottenness, and their blossoms shall go up like dust, because they have cast away the Law of Jehovah of Hosts, and despised the Word of the Holy One of Israel.

25. Therefore the anger of Jehovah is kindled against His people, and He has stretched out His hand against them, and has stricken them; and the hills trembled, and their corpses were as refuse in the midst of the streets. In all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.

26. And He will lift up a banner to distant nations, and will whistle to them from the ends of the earth; and behold, they shall come with speed, swiftly.

27. No one shall be weary nor stumble among them; no one shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the waistband of their loins be loosened, nor the thong of their sandals be broken;

28. whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses hooves seem like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind.

29. Their roaring shall be like a lion; they shall roar like young lions; and they shall roar and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and no one shall deliver it.

30. And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea; and if one looks to the land, behold darkness and distress; and the light is darkened by clouds.

## Isaiah 6

1. In the year that King Uzziah died I then saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple.

2. Above it stood the seraphim; each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.

3. And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of Hosts; the whole earth full of His glory!

4. And the doorposts shook at the voice of the one who cried out, and the house was filled with smoke.

5. Then I said, Woe is me! for I am undone! for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of Hosts.

6. Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from off the altar.

7. And he applied it to my mouth and said, Lo, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin is purged.

8. And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us? Then I said, Here am I! Send me.

9. And He said, Go, and tell this people, You listen to hear, but do not understand; you look to see, but do not perceive.

10. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn back, and be healed.

11. Then I said, Lord, how long? And He answered, Until the cities have been smashed to ruins without inhabitant, and the houses without a man, and the land is left devastated,

12. and until Jehovah has sent the men far away, and the desolation in the midst of the land is great.

13. But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return and be consumed like the terebinth and like the oak when it is cut down, whose stump remains. The holy seed is its stump.

## Isaiah 7

1. And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to make war against it, but could not prevail against it.

2. And it was told to the house of David, saying, Syria is allied with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest are swayed by the wind.

3. Then Jehovah said to Isaiah, Go out now to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-Jashub your son, at the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the highway to the Fullers Field.

4. And say to him, Take care and be quiet. Do not fear, nor be softhearted because of the two tails of these smoking firebrands, because of the fierce anger of Rezin from Syria, and of the son of Remaliah;

5. because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have plotted against you, saying,

6. Let us go up against Judah and trouble it, and break through the wall for ourselves, and set a king in the midst of it, the son of Tabeel.

7. Thus says the Lord Jehovah, It shall not stand, nor shall it come to pass.

8. For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken so that it shall not be a people.

9. And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliahs son. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.

10. Furthermore Jehovah spoke again to Ahaz, saying,

11. Ask for a sign from Jehovah your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.

12. But Ahaz said, I will not ask, nor will I tempt Jehovah.

13. And He said, Hear now, O house of David; is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also?

14. Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign: Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel.

15. Butter and honey He shall eat until He knows to refuse the evil and choose the good.

16. For before the Child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land that you loathe shall be forsaken by both its kings.

17. Jehovah shall bring upon you, and upon your people, and upon your fathers house, days that have not come since the days that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.

18. And it shall come to pass in that day that Jehovah shall whistle for the fly at the ends of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.

19. And they shall come, and all of them shall rest in the steep valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and on all the thorns, and on all the pastures.

20. In the same day the Lord shall shave with a hired razor, with those beyond the River, with the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet, and it shall also snatch away the beard.

21. And it shall be in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow and two sheep;

22. so it will be that, from the abundance of milk which they shall give, that He shall eat butter; for everyone who is left in the land shall eat butter and honey.

23. And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place where there were a thousand vines, worth a thousand pieces of silver, it shall even be for briers and thorns.

24. With arrows and with bows, men shall come there, because all the land shall become briers and thorns.

25. And all hills which were hoed with the hoe, you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be a place to turn the ox loose, and for sheep to trample.

## Isaiah 8

1. And Jehovah said to me, Take a large scroll and write in it with a mans pen: Maher-shalal-hash-baz. (which means, Hurry to the plunder! Make haste to the spoils!)

2. And I took to myself faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

3. And I went in to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then Jehovah said to me, Call his name, Maher-shalal-hash-baz.

4. For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and, My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.

5. Jehovah also spoke to me again saying,

6. Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that flow softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliahs son;

7. therefore behold, the Lord brings up upon them the waters of the River, strong and abundant, even the king of Assyria and all his glory; and he shall come up over all his channels and go over all his banks.

8. And he shall pass through Judah. He shall overflow and go over; he shall reach to the neck. And the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of Your land, O Immanuel.

9. Suffer evil, O people, and be broken! Give ear, all you from distant lands. Gird yourselves and be broken. Gird yourselves and be broken!

10. Take counsel and make plans, but they will be frustrated. Speak a word, but it shall not stand; for the Mighty God is with us.

11. For Jehovah spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and warned me against walking in the way of this people, saying,

12. Do not say, A conspiracy! to everything which this people calls, A conspiracy! And do not be afraid with their fear, nor be terrified.

13. Sanctify Jehovah of Hosts Himself, and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread.

14. And He shall be a sanctuary for you; but a stone of stumbling, and a rock of falling to both the houses of Israel; and a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

15. And many among them shall stumble and fall and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.

16. Bind up the testimony, seal the Law among My disciples.

17. And I will wait on Jehovah, who hides His face from the house of Jacob; and I will watch for Him.

18. Behold, I and the children whom Jehovah has given me, are for signs and for wonders in Israel, from Jehovah of Hosts who dwells in Mount Zion.

19. And when they say to you, Consult the sorcerers and fortunetellers who peep and mutter; should not a people inquire of their God, rather than the living of the dead?

20. To the Law and to the Testimony! If they do not speak according to this Word, it is because there is no light in them.

21. And they shall pass through it, hard-pressed and hungry; and it shall come to pass that when they shall be hungry, that they shall be enraged and curse their king and their God, and look upward.

22. And they shall look to the land; and behold, trouble and darkness and gloom of anguish! And they shall be thrust into darkness.

## Isaiah 9

1. Nevertheless the gloom shall not be upon her who was in distress, as in the former time when He brought contempt upon the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali. For afterwards He will glorify the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations.

2. The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them the light has shined.

3. You have multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy. They rejoice before You according to the joy at harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoils.

4. For You have broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his taskmaster, as in the day of Midian.

5. For every trembling boot of the warrior, and the garments rolled in blood, shall be fuel for burning in the fire.

6. For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government shall be upon His shoulder; and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The Strong and Mighty God, The Eternal Father, The Prince of Peace.

7. Of the increase of His government and peace upon the throne of David there will be no end; and upon His kingdom, to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from now on, even forever. The zeal of Jehovah of Hosts will accomplish this.

8. The Lord sent a Word to Jacob, and it has fallen upon Israel.

9. And all the people shall know; Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, who say in pride and insolence of heart,

10. The bricks have fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we will use cedars instead.

11. Therefore Jehovah shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and spur his enemies on;

12. the Syrians in front and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.

13. For the people do not turn to Him who strikes them, nor do they seek Jehovah of Hosts.

14. Therefore Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and bulrush, in one day.

15. The elder and honorable, he is the head; and the prophet who teaches lies, he is the tail.

16. For the leaders of this people lead them astray; and those who are led by them are swallowed up.

17. Therefore the Lord shall not rejoice over their young men, nor shall He have mercy on their orphans and widows; for everyone is a hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks foolishness. In all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.

18. For wickedness burns like the fire; it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall billow up in a column of smoke.

19. Through the wrath of Jehovah of Hosts the land is scorched, and the people shall be as fuel for the fire; no man shall have compassion on his brother.

20. And he shall cut off on the right hand and be hungry; and he shall devour on the left, and they shall not be satisfied. Each man shall eat the flesh of his own arm;

21. Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and together they shall be against Judah. In all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.

## Isaiah 10

1. Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees, and who have written and continue to write toil;

2. to thrust aside the needy from judgment, and to rob the right from the poor of My people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may plunder the orphans!

3. And what will you do in the day of judgment, and in destruction when it comes from afar? To whom will you flee for help? And where will you leave your glory?

4. Without Me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. In all this His hand is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.

5. Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger! And the staff in their hand is My indignation.

6. I will send him against a hypocritical nation, and against the people of My wrath. I will command him to draw out the plunder, and to seize the spoils, and to trample them like the mud of the streets.

7. Yet he does not plan this, nor does his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off not a few nations.

8. For he says, Are not my commanders all like kings?

9. Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria like Damascus?

10. As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose graven images excelled those of Jerusalem and Samaria;

11. shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols as I have done to Samaria and her idols?

12. And it shall come to pass, when the Lord has completed all His work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, that He will say, I will punish the fruit of the proud heart of the king of Assyria and the glory of his haughty looks.

13. For he says, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am discerning. And I have removed the borders of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man.

14. And my hand has found, as a nest, the riches of the people; and as one gathers eggs that are left, I have gathered all the earth; and there was no one who moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.

15. Shall the ax boast itself against him who chops with it? Shall the saw magnify itself against him who moves it? As if the rod could swing itself at those who lift it up! As if a staff could rise up, as though it were not wood!

16. Therefore the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, shall send leanness among his fat ones; and under his glory He shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.

17. And the light of Israel shall be as a fire, and His Holy One as a flame; and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.

18. And it shall burn up the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field, both soul and body; and they shall be as when a sick one faints.

19. And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be so few, that a child might write them.

20. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob, shall never again lean on him who struck them; but will truly lean on Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel.

21. The remnant shall return, the remnant of Jacob, to the Strong and Mighty God.

22. For though Your people Israel are like the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return; the completion which is decreed shall overflow with righteousness.

23. For the Lord Jehovah of Hosts shall make a full end, as ordained, in the midst of all the land.

24. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts, O my people who dwell in Zion, do not fear Assyria. He shall strike you with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against you, in the way of Egypt.

25. But yet a little while, and the indignation shall cease, and My anger shall be for their destruction.

26. And Jehovah of Hosts shall stir up a scourge upon him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb; and as His staff was on the sea, so shall He lift it up in the way of Egypt.

27. And it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil.

28. He has come to Aiath, he has passed to Migron; at Michmash he has stored his equipment;

29. they have gone over the pass; they have taken lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid, Gibeah of Saul has fled.

30. Lift up your voice, O daughter of Gallim; cause it to be heard unto Laish; O poor Anathoth.

31. Madmenah has fled; the inhabitants of Gebim seek refuge.

32. Yet he shall remain at Nob that day; he shall shake his fist against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.

33. Behold, the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, shall lop off the bough with terror; and those exalted high shall be chopped down, and the haughty shall be humbled.

34. And He shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by the Mighty One.

## Isaiah 11

1. And a Branch shall go out from the trunk of Jesse, and a Shoot shall grow out of his roots.

2. And the Spirit of Jehovah shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah.

3. And He shall savor the fear of Jehovah. And He shall not judge according to the sight of His eyes, nor decide by the hearing of His ears.

4. But with righteousness He shall judge the poor, and shall decide with equity for the meek of the earth. And He shall strike the earth with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath of His lips He shall slay the wicked.

5. And righteousness shall be the waistband of His loins, and faithfulness the waistband of His heart.

6. The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.

7. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.

8. And the nursing child shall play near the hole of the adder, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the vipers den.

9. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.

10. And in that day there shall be the Root of Jesse, standing as a banner for the people; to Him the nations shall resort; and His resting place shall be glorious.

11. And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall again set His hand the second time to recover the remnant of His people who remain, from Assyria and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.

12. And He shall lift up a banner for the nations, and shall gather the outcasts of Israel and gather together the scattered ones of Judah from the four corners of the earth.

13. And the envy of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not distress Ephraim.

14. But they shall swoop down upon the shoulders of the Philistines to the west; they shall plunder the children of the east together; they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them.

15. And Jehovah shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Sea of Egypt; and with His scorching wind He shall shake His fist over the River, and shall strike it into seven streams, and make men tread it dry-shod.

16. And there shall be a highway for the remnant of His people, those left as survivors from Assyria; as it was for Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.

## Isaiah 12

1. And in that day you shall say, O Jehovah, I will praise You; though You were angry with me, Your anger is turned away, and You comfort me.

2. Behold, the Mighty God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid; for YAH JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; He also has become my salvation.

3. And with joy you shall draw water out of the wells of salvation.

4. And in that day you shall say, Praise Jehovah! Call upon His name; declare His doings among the people, make mention that His name is exalted.

5. Make music unto Jehovah; for He has done excellent things; this is known in all the earth.

6. Cry out and shout, O inhabitant of Zion; for great is the Holy One of Israel in your midst!

## Isaiah 13

1. The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw:

2. Lift up a banner on the bare mountain, raise the voice to them; wave the hand, so that they may enter the gates of the nobles.

3. I have commanded My consecrated ones; I have also called My mighty ones for My anger, those who rejoice in My majesty.

4. The sound of a multitude in the mountains, as of many people! A tumultuous sound of the kingdoms of nations gathered together! Jehovah of Hosts musters the army for battle.

5. They come from a distant land, from the ends of the heavens; Jehovah and the weapons of His indignation, to destroy the whole land.

6. Howl! For the day of Jehovah is at hand! It shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.

7. Therefore all hands shall be faint, and every mans heart shall melt;

8. and they shall be afraid. Pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them. They shall writhe like a woman giving birth. They shall be amazed at one another; their faces like flames.

9. Behold, the day of Jehovah comes, cruel and with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land waste; and He shall destroy its sinners out of it.

10. For the stars of the heavens and their constellations shall not give light; the sun shall be darkened in its going forth, and the moon shall not shine its light.

11. And I will punish the world for its evil, and the wicked for their iniquity. And I will put an end to the arrogance of the proud, and will lay low the haughtiness of the tyrants.

12. I will make mortal man more precious than refined gold; even mankind than the pure gold of Ophir.

13. Thus I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall move out of its place, in the wrath of Jehovah of Hosts, and in the day of His fierce anger.

14. And it shall be as a hunted gazelle, and as a sheep that no man takes up; each man shall turn to his own people, and everyone flee into his own land.

15. Everyone who is found shall be thrust through; and everyone who is captured shall fall by the sword.

16. Their children shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be plundered, and their wives ravished.

17. Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who shall not value silver; and they shall not delight in gold.

18. Their bows shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children.

19. And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the majestic beauty of Chaldea, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.

20. It shall nevermore be inhabited, nor shall it be lived in from generation to generation; nor shall the Arabian pitch his tent there; nor shall the shepherds make their flocks lie down there.

21. But the wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of howling creatures; and young owls shall dwell there, and wild goats shall skip about.

22. And howling beasts shall respond from desolate places, and dragons in the delightful palaces. Indeed, her time will soon come to pass, and her days shall not be prolonged.

## Isaiah 14

1. For Jehovah will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel and settle them in their own land; and the sojourner shall be joined with them, and they shall cling to the house of Jacob.

2. And the people shall take them and bring them to their place; and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of Jehovah for servants and maids. And they shall make captives of their captors; and they shall rule over their oppressors.

3. And it shall come to pass in the day that Jehovah shall give you rest from your sorrow, and from your fear, and from the hard service with which you were worked,

4. that you shall take up this proverb against the king of Babylon and say, How the oppressor has ceased! The golden city has ceased!

5. Jehovah has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers

6. who struck peoples in wrath, strokes without letup, ruling the nations in anger, a persecution without restraint.

7. The whole earth is at rest and is quiet; they break forth into singing.

8. Yea, the noble trees rejoice over you, the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since you have been laid down, no woodcutter comes up against us.

9. Sheol from below is excited over you, to meet you at your coming. It stirs up the dead for you, all the chief of the earth. It has raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.

10. All of them shall speak and say to you, Are you also as weak as we? Have you become like us?

11. Your arrogance is brought down to Sheol, and the noise of your lutes. The maggot is spread under you, and the worms cover you.

12. How you are fallen from the heavens, O shining one, son of the morning! How you are cut down to the ground, you who weakened the nations!

13. For you have said in your heart, I will ascend into the heavens, I will exalt my throne above the stars of the Mighty God; I will also sit on the mount of the appointed assembly, in the recesses of the north.

14. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.

15. Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol, to the recesses of the Pit.

16. Those who see you shall stare at you and consider diligently, saying, Is this the man who made the earth to tremble; who shook kingdoms;

17. who made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed its cities; who did not open the house for his prisoners?

18. All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.

19. But you are cast out of your grave like an abhorred branch, and like the apparel of those who are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; like a carcass trampled under foot.

20. You shall not be joined with them in burial, because you destroyed your land and killed your people; the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.

21. Prepare slaughter for his children because of the iniquity of their fathers, so that they may not rise nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.

22. For I will rise up against them, says Jehovah of Hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name and remnant, and offspring, and posterity, says Jehovah.

23. I will also make it a possession for the hedgehog, and marshes of muddy water; and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction, says Jehovah of Hosts.

24. Jehovah of Hosts has sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so it shall come to pass; and as I have purposed, so it shall stand;

25. to break Assyria in My land, and on My mountains to trample him under foot. Then his yoke shall be removed from them, and his burden shall be taken from off their shoulders.

26. This is the purpose that is purposed upon all the earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.

27. For Jehovah of Hosts has purposed, and who shall annul it? And His hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?

28. This burden was in the year that King Ahaz died:

29. Rejoice not, all you of Philistia, because the rod that struck you is broken; for a viper comes forth from the root of the serpent, and his offspring shall be a fiery flying serpent.

30. And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety; and I will kill your root with famine, and he shall slay your remnant.

31. Howl, O gate! Cry, O city! O Philistia, all of you are melted away; for from the north a smoke comes, with no straggler in his ranks.

32. What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That Jehovah has founded Zion, and the poor of His people shall take refuge in it.

## Isaiah 15

1. The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste; it is cut off; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste; it is cut off.

2. One has gone up to the house, even to Dibon, the high places, to weep. Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba; baldness shall be on all their heads, and every beard cut off.

3. In the streets they shall clothe themselves with sackcloth; on the tops of their houses and in their streets everyone shall howl, weeping bitterly.

4. And Heshbon and Elealeh shall cry for help; their voice shall be heard as far as Jahaz. So the armed soldiers of Moab shall shout; he trembles for his life.

5. My heart shall call out to Moab; his fugitives flee to Zoar like a three year old heifer. He goes up the ascent to Luhith with weeping; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up an outcry of destruction.

6. For the waters of Nimrim are desolate; for the grass has dried up and the new grass fails; there is nothing green.

7. Therefore they shall carry off the abundance they have produced and stored, over to the Brook of the Willows.

8. For the cry has gone around all the borders of Moab, its howling even to Eglaim; its howling even to Beer-elim.

9. For the waters of Dimon are full of blood, for I will lay more upon Dimon; upon the escapees of Moab, lions, even upon the remnant of the land.

## Isaiah 16

1. Send the lamb to the ruler of the land, from Sela of the wilderness, to the mount of the daughter of Zion.

2. For it shall be as a fluttering bird cast out of the nest; so it shall be for the daughters of Moab at the fords of Arnon.

3. Take counsel, execute judgment; make your shadow as night in the middle of the day; hide the outcasts; do not betray the one who flees.

4. Let My outcasts dwell with you, Moab; be a shelter to them from the face of the destroyer; for the extortioner is at an end, the destroyer ceases, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.

5. And in mercy the throne shall be established; and One shall sit on it in truth in the tent of David, judging and seeking swift justice in righteousness.

6. We have heard of the pride of Moab; very proud; even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his rage; but it is all empty talk.

7. Therefore Moab shall howl for Moab, everyone shall howl. You shall mourn for the foundations of Kir-hareseth; surely they are stricken.

8. For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah. The lords of the nations have beat down its choice plants which have come to Jazer, and wandered in the wilderness; her branches are stretched out, they have crossed over the sea.

9. Therefore I will bewail the vine of Sibmah with the weeping of Jazer. I will drench you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh; for the shouting for your summer fruits and your harvest has fallen short.

10. Gladness and joy are removed out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there is no singing and no shouting. The treader shall tread out no wine in the presses; I have made their shouting to cease.

11. Therefore my stomach shall growl like a harp for Moab, and my inner being for Kir-heres.

12. And it shall come to pass when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not have enough strength.

13. This is the Word which Jehovah has spoken to Moab since that time.

14. But now Jehovah has spoken, saying, Within three years, like the years of a hireling, the glory of Moab shall be disgraced with all that great multitude; and the little remnant shall be few, not mighty.

## Isaiah 17

1. The burden against Damascus: Behold, Damascus is removed from being a city, and it shall be a heap of ruins.

2. The cities of Aroer are forsaken; now they are for flocks which lie down, and no one makes them afraid.

3. And the fortress shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the rest of Syria. They shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, says Jehovah of Hosts.

4. And it shall come to pass in that day that the glory of Jacob shall be laid low, and the fatness of his flesh shall be made lean.

5. And it shall be as the gathering of grain at harvest, and his arm reaps the heads of grain. And it shall be as he who gathers heads of grain in the Valley of Rephaim.

6. Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, like the shaking of an olive tree, where two or three ripe olives are in the top of the uppermost branch, with four or five in the fruitful branches of it, says Jehovah the God of Israel.

7. In that day a man shall look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.

8. And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, nor respect that which his fingers have made, neither the groves nor idols.

9. In that day his strong cities shall be like a forsaken branch, and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the children of Israel; and it shall become a desolation.

10. Because you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not been mindful of the Rock of your strength, therefore you shall plant pleasant plants and shall set strange shoots.

11. In the day you shall fence in your planting; and in the morning you shall make your seed sprout. But the harvest shall be a heap in the day of sickness and incurable pain.

12. Woe to the multitude of many people, who make a noise like the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations who make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!

13. The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters; but God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far away, and shall be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the tempest.

14. At evening time, behold, terror! Before the morning, he is no more! This is the portion of those who plunder us, and the lot of those who rob us.

## Isaiah 18

1. Woe to the land of whirring wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia,

2. which sends ambassadors by sea, even in vessels of reed on the waters, saying, Go, swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a people to be feared until now and onward; a mighty nation, treading underfoot; whose land the rivers have divided!

3. All you inhabitants of the world and you dwelling on the earth, you see when he lifts up a banner on the mountains. And you hear when he blows the shofar.

4. For thus Jehovah said to me, I will take My rest, and I will look on from My dwelling place, like radiant heat in the sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.

5. For before the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, then He will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the branches.

6. They shall be left together to the birds of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth; and the birds shall summer on them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter on them.

7. In that time the present shall be brought to Jehovah of Hosts from a nation tall and smooth, from a people to be feared until now and onward; a mighty nation, treading underfoot; whose land the rivers have divided; to the place of the name of Jehovah of Hosts, Mount Zion.

## Isaiah 19

1. The burden against Egypt: Behold, Jehovah rides on a swift cloud and comes into Egypt. And the idols of Egypt shall tremble at His presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in its midst.

2. And I will set Egyptians against Egyptians; and they shall fight each man against his brother, and each against his neighbor; city against city, kingdom against kingdom.

3. And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst of it, and I will destroy their counsel. And they shall inquire of the idols, and the sorcerers, and the mediums, and the fortunetellers.

4. And I will give Egypt over into the hand of a cruel master; and a fierce king shall rule over them, says the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts.

5. And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.

6. And rivers shall be odious from the stench; the Nile of Egypt will languish and dry up; the reeds and the rushes shall wither.

7. Bare places by the Nile, by the mouth of the Nile; and everything sown by the Nile shall dry up, be driven away, and be no more.

8. The fishermen also shall mourn, and all who drop a hook into the Nile shall lament, and those who spread nets on the waters shall grow feeble.

9. And those who work in fine flax, and those who weave white cloth shall be ashamed.

10. And her foundations shall be broken, and all who make wages shall be troubled in soul.

11. Surely the rulers of Zoan are fools; the counsel of the wise counselors of Pharaoh has become stupid. How do you say to Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?

12. Where are they? Where are your wise men? And let them tell you now, and let them know what Jehovah of Hosts has advised against Egypt.

13. The rulers of Zoan have become fools, the rulers of Noph are deceived; they have also misled Egypt, the chief of her tribes.

14. Jehovah has mixed a perverse spirit in its midst; and they have caused Egypt to err in all its work, like a drunkard staggers in his vomit.

15. And Egypt shall have no work that the head or tail, branch or rush, may do.

16. In that day Egypt shall be like women; and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Jehovah of Hosts, which He shakes over it.

17. And the land of Judah shall be a terror to Egypt; everyone who mentions it shall be afraid in himself because of the counsel of Jehovah of Hosts which He has devised against it.

18. In that day five cities in the land of Egypt shall speak the language of Canaan and swear to Jehovah of Hosts; one shall be called the City of Destruction.

19. In that day there shall be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Jehovah at its border.

20. And it shall be for a sign and for a witness to Jehovah of Hosts in the land of Egypt. For they shall cry unto Jehovah because of the oppressors, and He shall send them a deliverer, even a great one, and shall deliver them.

21. And Jehovah shall be known to Egypt, and Egypt shall know Jehovah in that day, and shall offer sacrifice and offering; and they shall vow a vow unto Jehovah, and make good.

22. And Jehovah shall strike Egypt; He shall strike and heal; and they shall return to Jehovah, and He will be entreated by them and heal them.

23. In that day there shall be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and Assyria shall come into Egypt, and Egypt into Assyria, and Egypt shall serve with Assyria.

24. In that day Israel shall be one of three with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth;

25. whom Jehovah of Hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be My people Egypt, and Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel My inheritance.

## Isaiah 20

1. In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and fought against Ashdod and took it;

2. at that time Jehovah spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loosen the sackcloth off your loins, and take your sandal off your foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.

3. And Jehovah said, Just as My servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years, as a sign and wonder to Egypt and Ethiopia;

4. so shall the king of Assyria lead away Egypt as captives, and Ethiopia as exiles, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with buttocks stripped bare, to the indecent exposure of Egypt.

5. And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their confidence, and of Egypt their glory.

6. And the inhabitant of this region shall say in that day, Behold our confidence to which we have fled for help, to be delivered from the king of Assyria! And now, how shall we escape?

## Isaiah 21

1. The burden against the wilderness of the sea: As tempests in the south pass through, so it comes from the wilderness, from a dreadful land.

2. An intense vision is declared to me: The deceiver deals treacherously, and the plunderer devastates. Go up, O Elam; besiege, O Media! I have caused all her sighing to cease.

3. Therefore my loins are filled with pain; pangs have taken hold on me like the pangs of a woman in labor. I am bent over from hearing it; I am dismayed from seeing it.

4. My heart has wandered, terror overwhelms me; the twilight I longed for He has turned into trembling.

5. Prepare the table, keep watch in the watchtower, eat, drink. Arise, you rulers, and anoint the shield.

6. For thus Jehovah has said to me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he sees.

7. And he saw a chariot with a pair of horsemen, a chariot of an ass, and a chariot of a camel. And he paid attention and listened with great diligence.

8. And he cried out, A lion! My lord, I stand continually on the watchtower by day, and I am stationed at my post all the nights.

9. And behold, here comes a chariot with a man, and a pair of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon has fallen, has fallen! And all the graven images of her gods He has smashed to the ground.

10. O my threshing, and the grain of my floor! That which I have heard from Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, I have declared to you.

11. The burden against Dumah: He calls to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?

12. The watchman said, The morning comes, and also the night; if you will inquire, inquire; come, return.

13. The burden against Arabia: You shall lodge in the forest of Arabia, O traveling companies of Dedanites.

14. The people of the land of Tema have brought water to him who was thirsty; they have met him who fled with their bread.

15. For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the vehemence of war.

16. For Jehovah has said to me, Within a year, according to the year of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar shall fail;

17. and the rest of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished; for Jehovah the God of Israel, has spoken.

## Isaiah 22

1. The burden against the Valley of Vision. What ails you now, that you have gone up to the housetops?

2. The noisy city, the joyous city, is filled with turbulence. Your slain ones are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle.

3. All your rulers have fled together; they have been captured without the bow; all who are found in you have been captured together; they have fled from afar.

4. Therefore I said, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly; do not insist on comforting me because of the devastation of the daughter of my people.

5. For it is a day of trouble, and of trampling down, and of perplexity by Jehovah of Hosts in the Valley of Vision; of breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.

6. And Elam carried the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.

7. And it shall come to pass that your choicest valleys shall be full of chariots; and the horsemen shall surely be set in array at the gate.

8. And he uncovered Judahs covering, and you looked in that day to the armor of the House of the Forest.

9. You have also seen the breaks in the city of David, that they are many; and you gathered the waters of the lower pool.

10. And you have counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you have broken down the houses to fortify the wall.

11. You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool; but you have not looked to its Maker, nor had regard for Him who formed it long ago.

12. And in that day Jehovah of Hosts called for weeping and mourning, and for baldness, and for girding with sackcloth.

13. But behold, joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine, saying, Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!

14. And it was revealed in my ears by Jehovah of Hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be atoned until you die, says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts.

15. Thus says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts, Depart, go to this steward, to Shebna who is over the house, and say,

16. What have you here? And who is here with you, that you have hewn out a tomb for yourself here, as one who proudly hews for himself a tomb, who carves out a dwelling place for himself in a rock?

17. Behold, Jehovah will cast you away into captivity, O mighty man, and will grasp and wrap you up.

18. He will wind up and whirl you like a ball into a large land; there you shall die, and there the chariots of your glory shall be the shame of your masters house.

19. And I will drive you from your position, and he will tear you down from your station.

20. And in that day it shall be that I will call My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah;

21. and I will clothe him with your robe, and will strengthen him with your sash, and I will entrust your rule into his hand. And he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.

22. And the key of the house of David I will lay on his shoulder; so he shall open, and no one shall shut; and he shall shut, and no one shall open.

23. And I will fasten him as a peg in a firm place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his fathers house.

24. And they shall hang on him all the glory of his fathers house, the offspring and the offshoots, all insignificant vessels, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of jars.

25. In that day, says Jehovah of Hosts, the peg that is fastened in the firm place shall be removed, and be cut down and fall. And the burden that was on it shall be cut off; for Jehovah has spoken.

## Isaiah 23

1. The burden against Tyre: Howl, ships of Tarshish! For it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in. From the land of Kittim it is revealed to them.

2. Be still, you inhabitants of the coast, merchants of Sidon, who pass over the sea. They have filled you.

3. And by great waters, the seed of Sihor and the harvest of the River was her revenue; and she is a marketplace for the nations.

4. Be ashamed, O Sidon; for the sea has spoken, the strength of the sea, saying, I have not travailed nor brought forth. I have not nourished young men nor raised up virgins.

5. As the report comes to Egypt, so they shall be writhing in pain at the report of Tyre.

6. Pass over to Tarshish. Howl, you inhabitants of the coast!

7. Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is from ancient days; whose feet carried it to distant lands to sojourn?

8. Who has advised this against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are rulers, whose traders are the honorable of the earth?

9. Jehovah of Hosts has counseled it, to dishonor the pride of all glory and to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.

10. Pass through your land like a river, O daughter of Tarshish; there is no more strength.

11. He stretched out His hand over the sea; He shook the kingdoms. Jehovah has given a command against the merchant city, to destroy its strongholds.

12. And He said, You shall rejoice no more, O crushed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, pass over to Kittim; there also you shall have no rest.

13. Behold the land of the Chaldeans, this people which did not exist. Assyria founded it for those who live in the desert. They set up their siege-towers; they stripped its palaces; they made it a ruin.

14. Howl, ships of Tarshish! For your strength is laid waste.

15. And in that day Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king. At the end of seventy years, it shall be for Tyre as the song of a harlot.

16. Take a harp, go about the city, O harlot who has been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs so that you may be remembered.

17. And it shall be after the end of seventy years that Jehovah will visit Tyre, and she shall return to her hire and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.

18. And her goods and her wages shall be set apart to Jehovah. It shall not be treasured nor laid up, for her goods shall be for those who dwell before Jehovah, to eat enough, and for fine clothing.

## Isaiah 24

1. Behold, Jehovah empties the earth and makes it bare, and distorts its face, and scatters its inhabitants.

2. And as it is with the people, so it shall be with the priest; as with the servant, so with the master; as with the maid, so it is with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the creditor, so with the debtor.

3. The land shall be completely emptied, and utterly plundered; for Jehovah has spoken this Word.

4. The earth mourns and fades away; the world droops and fades away; the haughty people of the earth grow feeble.

5. The earth is also defiled under its inhabitants; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, and have broken the perpetual covenant.

6. Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who dwell in it are held guilty; therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men are left.

7. The new wine mourns, the vine droops, all the merry-hearted sigh.

8. The mirth of the tambourines ceases; the tumult of the jubilant ends; the joy of the harp ceases.

9. They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink is bitter to those who drink it.

10. The city of emptiness is broken down; every house is shut up so that no one may come in.

11. There is a cry for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land has gone.

12. Desolation is left in the city, and the gate is battered and destroyed.

13. For so it is in the midst of the land among the people. It shall be like the shaking of an olive tree, and as gleanings of grapes when the vintage has been finished.

14. They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of Jehovah, they shall cry aloud from the sea.

15. Therefore glorify Jehovah in the light of the fire, the name of the Lord Jehovah of Israel from the seashores.

16. From the ends of the earth we have heard songs, glory to the righteous. But I said, Leanness to me! Leanness to me! Woe to me! Deceivers deceive, even with treachery. Deceivers deceive!

17. Terror and the pit and the snare are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth.

18. And it shall be that he who flees from the sound of terror shall fall into the pit. And he who comes up out of the midst of the pit shall be caught in the snare. For the windows from on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth quake.

19. The earth has been badly broken! The earth is split open and cracked through! The earth has shaken greatly and is tottering!

20. Like a drunkard the earth is staggering back and forth! And it sways to and fro like a hut! Its transgressions have been heavy upon it; and it shall fall and not rise again.

21. And it shall come to pass in that day that Jehovah will punish the host of the haughty ones on high; and on earth, the kings of the earth.

22. And they shall be gathered, as prisoners are gathered in a dungeon. And they shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days they shall be visited.

23. Then the moon shall be abashed, and the sun shall be ashamed, when Jehovah of Hosts shall reign on Mount Zion, in Jerusalem, and before His elders, in splendor.

## Isaiah 25

1. O Jehovah, You are my God; I will exalt You, I will praise Your name; for You have done wonders; Your counsels of old are steadfast faithfulness.

2. For You have made a city into a heap; a fortified city into a ruin; a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be rebuilt.

3. Therefore the strong people glorify You; the city of the ruthless nations shall fear You.

4. For You are a refuge to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a shelter from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the ruthless ones is like a storm against the wall.

5. You shall subdue the roaring of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud. The shouting of the terrible ones shall be pruned away.

6. And on this mountain Jehovah of Hosts will make a feast of fatness for all the people, a feast of the dregs of wine, of fat things full of marrow, of the dregs of refined wine.

7. And He will destroy on this mountain the surface of the covering wrapped over all people, and the veil that is woven over all nations.

8. He will swallow up death forever; and the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from all faces. And He will take away from all the earth the rebuke of His people. For Jehovah has spoken.

9. And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God. We have waited for Him, and He will save us. This is Jehovah; we have waited for Him, we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation.

10. For the hand of Jehovah shall rest on this mountain, and Moab shall be trampled under Him, even as straw is trampled in the water of a dung pit.

11. And He shall spread out His hands in their midst, as he who swims strokes to swim. And He will bring down their pride along with the deceit of their hands.

12. And the fortress of the high fort of your walls He will lay low, bring down to the ground, to the dust.

## Isaiah 26

1. In that day this song shall be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city; He sets up salvation as our walls and bulwarks.

2. Open the gates, that the righteous nation, keeping faithfulness, may enter in.

3. You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You; because he trusts in You.

4. Trust in Jehovah forever; for in YAH JEHOVAH is everlasting strength.

5. For He brings down those who dwell on high; He lays low the lofty city; He lays it low, even to the ground; He brings it down to the dust.

6. The foot shall trample it, the feet of the poor and the steps of the weak.

7. The way of the just is equity; O Upright One, You weigh the path of the just.

8. Yea, in the way of Your judgments, O Jehovah, we have waited for You; for the desire of our soul is Your name and the remembrance of You.

9. With my soul I have desired You in the night; yea, with my spirit within me I will seek You early; for when Your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.

10. Let favor be shown to the wicked, yet he will not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness he will deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of Jehovah.

11. Jehovah, when Your hand is lifted up, they will not see; but they shall see and be ashamed for their envy toward the people. Yes, the fire of Your enemies shall devour them.

12. Jehovah, You will establish peace for us; for You have also done all our works in us.

13. O Jehovah our God, masters besides You have had the rule over us; but by You only will we make mention of Your name.

14. Those who are dead do not live; spirits of the dead do not rise. Therefore You have punished and destroyed them, and made all memory of them to perish.

15. You have increased the nation, O Jehovah, You have increased the nation; You are glorified; You have extended it to the ends of the earth.

16. Jehovah, in trouble they have visited You; they have poured out a prayer when Your chastening was upon them.

17. As a woman with child draws near to giving birth, she writhes and cries out in her pangs; so have we been in Your sight, O Jehovah.

18. We have conceived; we have writhed in pain; but we have given birth (as it were) to wind. We have not produced any salvation in the earth; nor have the inhabitants of the world fallen out in birth.

19. Your dead ones shall live, together with My dead body they shall arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust; for your dew is as the dew of the light, and the earth shall cast out the dead.

20. Come, my people, enter into your rooms and shut your doors behind you; hide (as it were) for a few moments, until the indignation has passed.

21. For behold, Jehovah comes out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.

## Isaiah 27

1. In that day Jehovah with His great and fierce and strong sword shall punish Leviathan, the fleeing serpent; Leviathan, that twisted serpent; and He shall kill the dragon in the sea.

2. In that day sing to her, a vineyard of desirable wine.

3. I, Jehovah, keep it; I will water it every moment; lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.

4. Fury is not in Me; who would set the briers and thorns against Me in battle? I would march through them; I would burn them together.

5. Or let them take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me.

6. He shall cause those who come from Jacob to take root; Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.

7. Has He struck him, as He struck those who struck Him? Is He slain according to the slaughter of those slain by Him?

8. In driving and sending her away, you contend with her. He removes His fierce wind, in the day of the east wind.

9. Therefore by this shall the iniquity of Jacob be atoned; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he makes all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in pieces, the groves and idols shall not stand.

10. Yet the fortified city shall be desolate, and the dwelling forsaken and left like a wilderness; there shall the calf feed, and there shall it lie down and finish off its branches.

11. When its branches are dried up, they shall be broken off; the women come and set them on fire; for it is a people of no understanding. Therefore He who made them will not have mercy on them, and He who formed them will show them no favor.

12. And it shall be in that day that Jehovah will thresh from the flowing stream to the river of Egypt, and you shall be gathered one by one, O children of Israel.

13. And it shall be in that day that the great shofar shall be blown, and those about to perish in the land of Assyria shall come, along with the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall bow down to Jehovah in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.

## Isaiah 28

1. Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower which is at the head of the lush valleys of those who are overcome with wine!

2. Behold, the Lord is a mighty and strong one, like a hailstorm, a destroying storm; like a flood of mighty waters overflowing, He casts down to the earth with the hand.

3. The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trampled under foot;

4. and the glorious beauty at the head of the lush valley shall be a fading flower, and as the first-ripe fruit before the summer; which, the one looking at it swallows up while it is yet in his hand.

5. In that day Jehovah of Hosts shall be for a crown of glory and for a diadem of beauty to the rest of His people,

6. and for a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, and for strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.

7. But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink have gone astray. The priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink; they are swallowed up by wine; they have gone astray through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.

8. For all tables are full of vomit and excrement; no place is clean.

9. To whom shall He teach knowledge? And whom shall He make to understand the message? Those weaned from the milk and removed from the breasts.

10. For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little;

11. for with stammering lips and another tongue He will speak to this people.

12. To whom He said, This is the rest; cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing. Yet they were not willing to hear.

13. But the Word of Jehovah was to them, Precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little; that they might go and fall backward, and be broken and snared and caught.

14. Therefore hear the Word of Jehovah, you scornful men who rule this people in Jerusalem.

15. Because you have said, We have made a covenant with death, and we have made an agreement with Sheol; when the overflowing scourge shall have gone and passed through, it shall not come upon us; for we have made lies our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves under falsehood.

16. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I have founded in Zion a Stone, a tried Stone, a precious Cornerstone, a sure Foundation; he who trusts in It shall not be anxious.

17. Also I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.

18. And your covenant with death shall be covered over, and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand; when the overwhelming scourge shall pass through, then you shall be trampled down by it.

19. From the time that it goes out it shall take you; for morning by morning it shall pass over, by day and by night; and it shall be a terror just to understand the report.

20. For the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the cover is too narrow to wrap oneself in it.

21. For Jehovah shall rise up as at Mount Perazim; He will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon, so that He may do His deeds, His strange deeds; and bring to pass His works, His unusual works.

22. So then do not be mockers, lest your bonds be made strong; for I have heard from the Lord Jehovah of Hosts that an annihilation is decreed upon the whole earth.

23. Give ear and hear my voice; listen, and hear my speech.

24. Does the plowman plow all day to sow? Does he loosen and harrow his ground?

25. When he has leveled its surface, does he not scatter the black cumin and sprinkle the cumin, and plant the wheat in rows and mark off the barley and spelt in their boundaries?

26. For God instructs him to do right; and teaches him.

27. For the black cumin is not threshed with a threshing instrument, nor is a cart wheel turned on cumin; but the black cumin is beaten out with a stick and the cumin with a rod.

28. Bread flour is ground. But one does not continue treading and threshing it; nor does he destroy it with his cart wheel; nor pulverize it with his horse.

29. This also comes forth from Jehovah of Hosts, who is wonderful in counsel, and excels in sound wisdom.

## Isaiah 29

1. Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! Snatch away year after year; let the feasts come around.

2. Then I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow; and it shall be to me as Ariel.

3. And I will encamp against you all around, and will lay siege against you with a mount, and I will raise siege works against you.

4. And you shall be brought down; you shall speak out of the ground, and your speech shall be low out of the dust, and your voice shall be like a medium out of the ground, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.

5. And the multitude of your strangers shall be like fine dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passes away; yea, it shall be in an instant, suddenly.

6. You shall be visited by Jehovah of Hosts with thunder, and with earthquake and loud sounds, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.

7. And the multitude of all the nations who fight against Ariel, even all who fight against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, shall be like a dream of a night vision.

8. It shall even be as when a hungry one dreams, and behold, he eats, but he awakes and his soul is still empty; or as when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he drinks, but he awakes, and behold, he is still faint and his soul craves. So shall it be with the multitude of all the nations who fight against mount Zion.

9. Wait and wonder! Smear your eyes shut, blind! They have become drunk, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.

10. For Jehovah has poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes; He has covered the prophets and your heads, the seers.

11. And the vision of all has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed, which they give to one who is literate saying, Please read this; and he says, I cannot, for it is sealed.

12. And the book is delivered to him who is not literate, saying, Please read this; and he says, I am not literate.

13. Therefore Jehovah said, Whereas this people draw near with their mouth, and honor Me with their lips, but have removed their hearts far from Me, and their fear toward Me is taught by the commandment of men;

14. therefore, behold, I will again do among this people something extraordinary and wonderful. For the wisdom of their wise ones shall perish, and the understanding of their intelligent ones shall be hidden.

15. Woe to those who are profound to hide their counsel from Jehovah! And their works are in the dark, and they say, Who sees us? And, Who knows us?

16. O your perversity! Shall the former be esteemed as the potters clay; for shall the product say of him who made it, He did not make me? Or shall the thing formed say to him who formed it, He has had no understanding?

17. Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest.

18. And in that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of their gloom and darkness.

19. And the meek shall increase their joy in Jehovah, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

20. For the terrible one is brought to nothing, and the scorner is destroyed, and all who look after iniquity are cut off;

21. those who induce a man to sin by a word, and lay a snare for the judge in the gate, and turn aside the just for vanity.

22. Therefore thus says Jehovah, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, nor shall his face now become pale.

23. But when he sees his children, the work of My hands, in his midst, they shall sanctify My name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.

24. Those who erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and those who murmured shall learn doctrine.

## Isaiah 30

1. Woe to the rebellious children, says Jehovah, who take counsel, but not of Me; and who pour out drink offerings, but not of My Spirit; that they sweep away sin after sin;

2. who set out to go down to Egypt and have not asked at My mouth, to strengthen themselves in the refuge of Pharaoh and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!

3. Therefore the refuge of Pharaoh shall be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt shall be your reproach.

4. For his rulers were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.

5. They were all ashamed of a people who could not benefit them, nor be a help nor gain, but a shame and also a reproach.

6. The burden concerning the beasts of the south. Into the land of trouble and anguish, from where the lioness and the lion come; the viper, and the fiery flying serpent; they carry their riches on the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to a people that cannot profit them.

7. For Egypt helps in vain, and unto emptiness. Therefore I have proclaimed concerning this, Their arrogance will be to sit still.

8. Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and note it in a book, so that it may be for time to come forever and ever,

9. that this is a rebellious people, lying children; children who will not hear the Law of Jehovah;

10. who say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Do not prophesy to us right things, speak to us smooth things, prophesy deception;

11. turn away from the path, thrust aside from the way, desist from the Holy One of Israel from before us.

12. Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, Because you have despised this Word, and trust in oppression and perversity, and lean on them;

13. therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, a bulge in a high wall, whose crashing comes suddenly in an instant.

14. And He shall break it as the breaking of the potters vessel that is broken in pieces. He shall not spare, so that there shall not be found in the fragments of it a shard with which to take fire from the hearth, or to take water out of the cistern.

15. For thus says the Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, In returning and rest you shall be saved; and in quietness and confidence shall be your strength. But you were not willing.

16. But you said, No; for we will flee on horses. Therefore you shall flee. And you said, We will ride on the swift; therefore those who pursue you shall be swift.

17. One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five you shall flee, until you are left as a beacon on the top of a mountain, and as a sign on a hill.

18. And so Jehovah waits to be gracious to you. And therefore He is exalted, that He may have mercy on you; for Jehovah is a God of justice. Blessed are all those who wait for Him.

19. For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem; you shall weep no more. He will be very gracious to you at the sound of your cry. When He hears it, He will answer you.

20. And though Jehovah gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your teachers shall not be removed into a corner any more, but your eyes shall see your teachers.

21. And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, This is the way, walk in it, when you turn to the right hand and when you turn to the left.

22. You shall also defile the covering of your graven images of silver, and the ornament of your molten images of gold. You shall cast them away like a menstruous cloth. You shall say to them, Get away!

23. Then He shall give the rain for your seed with which you sow the ground. And the bread of the produce of the earth also shall be fat and plentiful. In that day your cattle shall feed in large pastures.

24. Also the oxen and the young asses that plow the ground shall eat cured fodder, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.

25. And there shall be on every high mountain, and on every high hill, rivers, streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.

26. And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that Jehovah binds up the breach of His people and heals the stroke of their wound.

27. Behold, the name of Jehovah comes from afar, burning with His anger, and the burden of it is heavy; His lips are full of indignation, and His tongue like a devouring fire.

28. And like an overflowing stream, His breath shall reach up to the middle of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity. And there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to go astray.

29. You shall have a song, as in the night when a holy feast is consecrated; and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a flute to come into the mountain of Jehovah, to the Mighty One of Israel.

30. And Jehovah shall cause His glorious voice to be heard, and shall cause to be seen the bringing down of His arm, with raging anger and flame of a devouring fire, with driving storm, cloudburst and hailstones.

31. For through the voice of Jehovah, Assyria shall be beaten down, as struck with a rod.

32. And in every place where the appointed staff shall pass, which Jehovah shall lay upon him, it shall be with tambourines and harps. In war with brandishing He will engage the battle.

33. For Tophet was arranged in order of old; yea, for the king it is prepared. He has made it deep and large. He makes a fire with much wood. The breath of Jehovah kindles it like a torrent of brimstone.

## Isaiah 31

1. Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, and lean on horses and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are so very strong; but they do not look to the Holy One of Israel, nor do they seek Jehovah!

2. Yet He also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back His Words, but will arise against the house of evildoers and against the help of those who work iniquity.

3. Now Egypt is a man, and not the Mighty God; and their horses are flesh, and not Spirit. When Jehovah shall stretch out His hand, both he who helps shall fall, and he who is helped shall fall down, and they shall all be finished together.

4. For thus has Jehovah spoken to me: As the lion roars, and the young lion over his prey when a multitude of shepherds are summoned against him (he will not be afraid of their voice, nor fret himself because of their noise), so Jehovah of Hosts shall come down to fight for Mount Zion, and for its hill.

5. As birds flying, so Jehovah of Hosts will defend Jerusalem; also defending, He will deliver it; and passing over He will preserve it.

6. Return to Him, against whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted.

7. For in that day every man shall reject his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your hands have made for you, a sin.

8. Then Assyria shall fall by the sword, not of man; and the sword, not of mankind, shall devour him. For he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall become forced labor.

9. And he shall pass over to his stronghold for fear, and his rulers shall be afraid of the banner, says Jehovah, whose fire is in Zion, and His furnace in Jerusalem.

## Isaiah 32

1. Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and rulers shall rule with justice.

2. And a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind, and a shelter from the tempest, like streams of water in a dry place, like the shade of a huge rock in a weary land.

3. And the eyes of those who see shall not be dim, and the ears of those who hear shall listen.

4. And the heart of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of those who stutter shall be ready to speak plainly.

5. The fool shall no more be called noble, nor the miser said to be bountiful.

6. For the fool will speak folly, and his heart will work iniquity; to practice hypocrisy and to speak error against Jehovah, to empty the soul of the hungry, and to cause the drink of the thirsty to be lacking.

7. Also the implements of the scoundrel are evil; he devises wicked plans to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaks justice.

8. But the noble devises noble things; and by noble things he shall stand.

9. Rise up, you women who are at ease; hear my voice, you careless daughters; listen to my speech.

10. Many days and years you shall be troubled, you careless women; for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.

11. Tremble, you women at ease; be troubled, you careless ones; strip yourselves and make yourselves bare, and gird sackcloth on your loins.

12. They shall mourn for the breasts, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.

13. On the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city;

14. because the palaces shall be abandoned, the multitude of the city shall be deserted. Instead, the mound and tower shall be for dens forever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;

15. until the Spirit is poured on us from on high, and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field is esteemed as a forest.

16. Then justice shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness shall remain in the fruitful field.

17. And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the service of righteousness shall be quietness and assurance forever.

18. And my people shall dwell in a peaceful habitation, and in secure dwellings and in quiet resting places,

19. though it hails upon the forest, and the city is laid low.

20. Blessed are you who sow beside all waters, who send free the feet of the ox and the ass.

## Isaiah 33

1. Woe to the destroyer, and you have not been destroyed; and the betrayer, and they have not betrayed you. When you stop destroying, you shall be destroyed. When you stop betraying, they shall betray you.

2. O Jehovah, be gracious to us; we have waited for You. Be their arm every morning; our salvation also in the time of trouble.

3. At the sound of the tumult the people have fled; at the lifting up of Yourself the nations have been scattered.

4. And your spoils shall be gathered as the locust gathers; as the running to and fro of locusts he shall run upon them.

5. Jehovah is exalted, for He dwells on high. He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.

6. Wisdom and knowledge shall be the steadfastness of your times, and the strength of salvation; the fear of Jehovah is His treasure.

7. Behold, their mighty ones shall cry outside; the messengers of peace shall weep bitterly.

8. The highways lie waste, the traveler ceases. He has broken the covenant. He has despised the cities. He has had regard for no man.

9. The earth mourns and has grown feeble. Lebanon is ashamed and withers; Sharon is like a wilderness; Bashan and Carmel are shaken out like empty fruit trees.

10. Now I will arise, says Jehovah; now I will be exalted; now I will lift up Myself.

11. You shall conceive chaff, you shall bring forth stubble; your breath, like fire, shall devour you.

12. And the people shall be like the burnings of lime; like thorns cut up they shall be burned in the fire.

13. You who are far off, hear what I have done; and you who are near, perceive and know My might.

14. The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling has taken hold of the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?

15. He who walks righteously and speaks with equity; he who despises the gain of oppressions, who shakes his hands free from holding bribes, who stops his ear from hearing of blood, and shuts his eyes from seeing evil;

16. he shall dwell on high; his refuge shall be the strongholds of rocks; bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.

17. Your eyes shall see the King in His beauty; they shall behold the land that is very far off.

18. Your heart shall muse on terror. Where is the scribe? Where is the one who weighs? Where is the one who counts the towers?

19. You shall not see a fierce people, a people of unintelligible speech that you cannot perceive; of a stammering tongue that you cannot understand.

20. Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed meetings; your eyes shall see Jerusalem, a quiet home, a tent that shall not be taken down; not one of its stakes shall ever be removed, nor shall any of its cords be broken.

21. But there the glorious Jehovah will be to us a place of broad rivers and streams, in which no galley with oars shall go, nor shall majestic ships pass by.

22. For Jehovah is our Judge, Jehovah is our Lawgiver, Jehovah is our King; He will save us.

23. Your ropes are loosened, they could not hold the base of the mast, they could not spread the sail. Then the prey of a great plunder is divided; the lame take the spoils.

24. And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick; the iniquity of the people who dwell there shall be taken away.

## Isaiah 34

1. Come near, you nations, to hear; and you people, pay attention; let the earth hear, and its fullness; the world, and all its offspring.

2. For the wrath of Jehovah is upon all nations, and His fury upon all their armies. He has utterly destroyed them, He has delivered them to the slaughter.

3. Also their slain shall be thrown out, and their stench shall come up out of their corpses, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.

4. And all the host of the heavens shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled up like a scroll; and all their host shall wither, as a leaf withers off the vine, and as fruit falling from the fig tree.

5. For My sword is drenched in the heavens. Behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of My curse, for judgment.

6. The sword of Jehovah is filled with blood; it is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for Jehovah has a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.

7. And the oryx shall come down with them, and the young bulls with the mighty; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.

8. For it is the day of Jehovahs vengeance, the year of retribution for the strife against Zion.

9. And its streams shall be turned into pitch, and its dust into brimstone, and its land shall become burning pitch.

10. It shall not be quenched night or day; its smoke shall ascend forever. From generation to generation it shall lie waste; no one shall pass through it forever and forever.

11. But the pelican and the porcupine shall possess it; the owl also, and the raven, shall dwell in it. And He shall stretch out over it the line of chaos, and the stones of emptiness.

12. They shall call its nobles to the kingdom, but no one shall be there, and all its rulers shall be nothing.

13. And thorns shall come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles in its fortresses; and it shall be a habitation of dragons and a dwelling for young owls.

14. The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the howling beasts; and the shaggy goat shall cry to his fellow. The night creature also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.

15. There the great owl shall make her nest, and lay and hatch, and gather them under her shadow; there shall the birds of prey also be gathered, every one with her mate.

16. Search from the book of Jehovah, and read; not one of these shall fail, not one shall lack her mate; for My mouth has commanded, and His Spirit has gathered them.

17. And He has cast the lot for them, and His hand has divided it unto them by measuring line; they shall possess it perpetually, from generation to generation they shall dwell in it.

## Isaiah 35

1. The wilderness and the desert shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose.

2. It shall blossom abundantly and rejoice, even with joy and singing. The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon. They shall see the glory of Jehovah and the majesty of our God.

3. Make the weak hands strong, and make the feeble knees secure.

4. Say to those of anxious heart, Be strong, fear not! Behold, your God will come with vengeance, with the recompense of God. He will come and save you.

5. Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.

6. Then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing. For in the wilderness waters shall break out, and streams in the desert.

7. And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land shall become springs of water, in the habitation of dragons where they dwell, a place for grass with reeds and rushes.

8. And a highway shall be there, even a road; and it shall be called, The Way of Holiness. The unclean shall not pass over it. Whoever travels on it, though a fool, shall not go astray.

9. No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up on it; they shall not be found there. But only the redeemed shall walk there.

10. And the ransomed of Jehovah shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy on their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.

## Isaiah 36

1. Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them.

2. And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem, to King Hezekiah, with a great army. And he stood by the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the highway to the Fullers Field.

3. Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, came out to him.

4. And Rabshakeh said to them, Say now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this in which you trust?

5. You say (but they are only words of the lips), I have counsel and strength for war. Now, in whom do you trust, that you rebel against me?

6. Lo, you trust in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; on which, if a man leans on it, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.

7. But if you say to me, We trust in Jehovah our God; is it not He whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, You shall bow down before this altar?

8. Now then, please exchange pledges with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are even able on your part to put riders on them.

9. How then will you repel the face of one commander of the least of my masters servants, and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?

10. Have I now come up without Jehovah against this land to destroy it? Jehovah said to me, Go up against this land and destroy it.

11. Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. But do not speak to us in the Jewish language in the ears of the people who are on the wall.

12. But Rabshakeh said, Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?

13. Then Rabshakeh stood and called out with a loud voice in the Jewish language and said, Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!

14. Thus says the king, Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he shall not be able to deliver you!

15. Nor let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will deliver, to rescue us; this city shall not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria!

16. Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria, Make a peace treaty with me, and come out to me; and let everyone eat of his vine, and everyone of his fig tree, and everyone drink the waters of his own cistern,

17. until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and fresh wine, a land of bread and vineyards!

18. Let not Hezekiah persuade you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

19. Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Indeed, have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?

20. Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their land out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?

21. But they kept silent and did not answer him a word, for the kings command said, Do not answer him.

22. Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and reported to him the words of Rabshakeh.

## Isaiah 37

1. And it happened when King Hezekiah heard it that he tore his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah.

2. And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.

3. And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and of blasphemy! For the children have come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring forth.

4. It may be that Jehovah your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which Jehovah your God has heard. Therefore, lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.

5. So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

6. And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall you say to your master, Thus says Jehovah, Do not be afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.

7. Behold, I will send a spirit upon him, and he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land. And I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.

8. So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.

9. And he heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia saying, He has come out to wage war with you. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

10. Thus you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Do not let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.

11. Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by utterly destroying them. And shall you be delivered?

12. Have the gods of the nations delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed: Gozan and Haran and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar?

13. Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?

14. And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messenger, and read it. And Hezekiah went up into the house of Jehovah and spread it before Jehovah.

15. And Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah, saying,

16. O Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, Who dwells between the cherubim, You are God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made the heavens and the earth.

17. Extend Your ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open Your eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to taunt the Living God.

18. Truly, O Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their lands,

19. and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were no gods, but the work of mens hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.

20. Now therefore, O Jehovah our God, save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You are Jehovah, You alone.

21. Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Because you have prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,

22. this is the word which Jehovah has spoken concerning him: The virgin, the daughter of Zion, has despised you and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head behind you.

23. Whom have you mocked and blasphemed? And against whom have you raised your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? Even against the Holy One of Israel.

24. By your servants you have taunted Jehovah and have said, By my many chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains beside Lebanon; and I will cut down its tall cedars, and its choice fir trees; and I will go to the extremities of its height, the forest of its Carmel.

25. I have dug and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet I have dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.

26. Have you not heard from distant lands how I have done it? Even from ancient times I have formed it. Now I have brought it to pass, that your fortified cities should be caused to crash into heaps of ruins.

27. And their inhabitants had little power; being dismayed and ashamed. They were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and the standing grain before the field.

28. But I know where you dwell, and your going out, and your coming in, and your rage against Me.

29. Because your raging against Me, and your arrogance has come up into My ears, therefore I will put My hook in your nose, and My bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way from which you came.

30. And this shall be a sign to you: You shall eat grain this year from what was sown by itself; and the second year that which springs from the same; and in the third year you shall sow, and reap, and plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them.

31. And the remnant that escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward;

32. for out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant, and those who escape out of Mount Zion. The zeal of Jehovah of Hosts shall do this.

33. Therefore thus says Jehovah to the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a mound against it.

34. By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and shall not come into this city, says Jehovah.

35. For I will defend this city to save it, for My own sake and for My servant Davids sake.

36. Then the angel of Jehovah went out and struck a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of Assyria. And when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.

37. So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and remained in Nineveh.

38. And it came to pass as he was bowing down in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him with the sword. And they escaped into the land of Ararat; and Esar-Haddon his son reigned in his place.

## Isaiah 38

1. In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death. And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.

2. Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to Jehovah,

3. and said, Remember now, O Jehovah, I beseech You, how I have walked before You in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done what is good in Your eyes. And Hezekiah wept with a great weeping.

4. Then came the Word of Jehovah to Isaiah, saying,

5. Go and say to Hezekiah: Thus says Jehovah the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will add to your days fifteen years.

6. And I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.

7. And this shall be a sign to you from Jehovah that Jehovah will do this thing that He has spoken:

8. behold, I will bring back the shadow which has gone down the steps on the sundial of Ahaz, ten steps backward. So the sun returned ten steps, by which it had gone down.

9. This is the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:

10. I said at the end of of my days, I shall go to the gates of Sheol; I am deprived of the rest of my years.

11. I said, I shall not see YAH, Jehovah, in the land of the living; I shall look on man no more among the inhabitants of the world.

12. My generation is plucked up and removed from me like a shepherds tent; I have cut off my life like a weaver; He will cut me off from the loom; from day even to night You make an end of me.

13. I have been still until morning; as a lion, so He breaks all my bones; from day even until night You make an end of me.

14. Like a twittering swallow, so I chatter; I mourn as a dove; my eyes look weakly to the heights. O Jehovah, I am distressed; be surety for me.

15. What shall I say? He has spoken to me, and He Himself has acted; I shall go slowly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.

16. O Jehovah, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit; so You will restore me to health and make me live.

17. Behold, instead of peace I was bitter with bitterness; but You have delighted in delivering my soul from the pit of corruption. You have cast all my sins behind Your back.

18. For Sheol cannot thank You, death cannot praise You; those who go down into the pit cannot hope for Your truth.

19. The living, the living man, he shall praise You, as I do this day; the father shall make Your truth known to the children.

20. Jehovah is there to save me; therefore we will sing my songs with the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of Jehovah.

21. For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs and rub it on the boil, and he shall live.

22. Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of Jehovah?

## Isaiah 39

1. At that time Merodach-Baladan the son of Baladan king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that he had been sick, and had recovered.

2. And Hezekiah was glad because of them, and showed them the house of his treasures; the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all his armory, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.

3. Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, What did these men say? And where did they come from to you? And Hezekiah said, They have come to me from a distant land, from Babylon.

4. Then he said, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house they have seen; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.

5. Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the Word of Jehovah of Hosts:

6. Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left, says Jehovah.

7. And some of your sons which shall come forth from you, which you shall beget, shall be taken away; and they shall be officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.

8. Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, The Word of Jehovah which you have spoken is good. For he said, At least there shall be peace and truth in my days.

## Isaiah 40

1. Comfort, O comfort My people, says your God.

2. Speak to the heart of Jerusalem, and cry out to her, that her warfare is ended, that her iniquity is pardoned; for she has received from the hand of Jehovah double for all her sins.

3. The voice of one crying out in the wilderness, Prepare the way of Jehovah, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.

4. Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the crooked places shall be made level, and the rough places a plain;

5. and the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.

6. The voice said, Cry out! And he said, What shall I proclaim? All flesh is grass, and all the goodness of it is as the flower of the field.

7. The grass withers, the flower fades, because the Spirit of Jehovah blows upon it; surely the people are grass.

8. The grass withers, the flower fades; but the Word of our God stands forever.

9. You, who brings good tidings to Zion, go up onto the high mountain. Lift up your voice with strength, you who brings good tidings to Jerusalem, lift it up, be not afraid. Say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!

10. Behold, the Lord Jehovah will come with a strong hand, and His arm shall rule for Him; behold, His reward is with Him, and His work before Him.

11. He shall feed His flock like a shepherd; He shall gather the lambs with His arm, and carry them in His bosom, and shall gently lead those who are with young.

12. Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and measured out the heavens with a span? And who has calculated the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?

13. Who has directed the Spirit of Jehovah, and what man, as a counselor, has taught Him?

14. With whom did He take counsel, and who instructed Him and taught Him in the path of justice; and taught Him knowledge, and made known the way of understanding to Him?

15. Behold, the nations are like a drop in a bucket, and are counted as the fine dust on the scales; behold, He lifts up the islands as a very little thing.

16. And Lebanon is not enough to burn, nor the beasts of it enough for a burnt offering.

17. All the nations before Him are as nothing; and to Him they are accounted as less than nothing, and vanity.

18. To whom then will you compare the Mighty God? Or what likeness will you compare to Him?

19. The workman casts a graven image, and the goldsmith spreads it over with gold, and smelts silver chains.

20. Whoever is too poor for such an offering chooses a tree that will not rot; he looks for a skillful workman to prepare a graven image that will not totter.

21. Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?

22. It is He who sits upon the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; Who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in;

23. Who brings the rulers to nothing; He makes the judges of the earth as nothing.

24. Indeed, they shall not be planted; indeed, they shall not be sown. Indeed, their stump shall not take root in the earth. And He shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the tempest shall take them away like stubble.

25. To whom then will you compare Me, or with whom am I equal? says the Holy One.

26. Lift up your eyes on high, and consider who has created these things, who brings out their host by number. He calls them all by name by the greatness of His might, for He is strong in power; not one is missing.

27. Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, My way is hidden from Jehovah and my judgment is passed over by God?

28. Have you not known? Have you not heard, that the eternal God, Jehovah, the Creator of the ends of the earth, does not grow faint nor weary? His understanding is unsearchable.

29. He gives power to the faint; and to him with no strength, He increases might.

30. Even the young shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall be feeble and stumble;

31. but those who wait upon Jehovah shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint.

## Isaiah 41

1. Keep silence before Me, O coastlands; and let the people renew their strength; let them come near. Then let them speak, Let us come near together for judgment.

2. Who raised up the righteous one from the east, called him to His foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? Who gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his bow?

3. Who pursued them and passed by in peace by the way he had not gone before by foot?

4. Who has planned and done it, calling forth the generations from the beginning? I, Jehovah, am the First and the Last. I am He.

5. The coastlands saw and feared. The ends of the earth were afraid, and drew near and came.

6. They each one helped his neighbor, and said to his brother, Be strong.

7. So the craftsman encourages the refiner, and he who smooths with the hammer, him who struck the anvil, saying of the soldering, It is good. And he makes it steady with nails so that it will not be shaken.

8. But you, Israel, are My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham, My friend;

9. whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called you and set you apart. And I said to you, You are My servant; I have chosen you, and not cast you away.

10. Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will make you strong; yes, I will help you; yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of My righteousness.

11. Behold, all those who were enraged against you shall be ashamed and disgraced; they shall be as nothing. And those who strive with you shall perish.

12. You shall seek them, and shall not find them; the men striving against you shall be as nothing; at an end.

13. For I, Jehovah your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you, Fear not; I will help you.

14. Fear not, you worm of Jacob and men of Israel; I will help you, says Jehovah and your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.

15. Behold, I have made you into a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth; you shall thresh the mountains, and beat them fine, and shall make the hills like chaff.

16. You shall winnow them, and the wind shall carry them away, and a tempest shall scatter them. And you shall rejoice in Jehovah and shall glory in the Holy One of Israel.

17. The poor and needy seek water, and there is none; their tongue fails for thirst. I Jehovah will hear them, I the God of Israel will not abandon them.

18. I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.

19. I will plant the cedar in the wilderness, the acacia tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree. I will set the fir tree in the desert, and the pine, and the box tree together;

20. that they may see and know, and determine and understand together, that the hand of Jehovah has done this, and the Holy One of Israel has created it.

21. Present your case, says Jehovah; approach to argue your defense, says the King of Jacob.

22. Let them approach, and confess to us what shall happen; let them disclose the former things, what they are, that we may determine a finding and know the final outcome; or proclaim to us things to come.

23. Make known the things to come after this, so that we may know that you are gods. Yes, do good, or do evil, so that we may anxiously watch it together.

24. Behold, you are nothing, and your work is nothing. He who chooses you is an abomination.

25. I have raised up one from the north and he shall come; from the sunrise he shall call upon My name. And he shall come against rulers as in a mortar, and as the potter tramples clay.

26. Who has declared from the beginning, that we may know? And formerly, that we may say, He is righteous? Yea, no one declares; yea, no one proclaims; yea, no one hears your words.

27. First I shall say to Zion, Behold! Behold them! And I will give to Jerusalem one who brings good news.

28. For I looked, and there was no man; and of those there was no counselor, that I might ask and they could answer a word.

29. Behold, they are all wicked; their works are nothing; their molten images are like thin air and vanity.

## Isaiah 42

1. Behold My Servant, whom I uphold; My Elect, in whom My soul delights. I have put My Spirit upon Him; He shall bring forth justice to the nations.

2. He shall not cry out, nor lift up, nor cause His voice to be heard in the street.

3. A bruised reed He shall not break, and a smoking wick He shall not quench; He shall bring forth justice unto truth.

4. He shall not fail nor be discouraged, until He has established justice on the earth; and the islands shall wait for His Law.

5. Thus says Jehovah the Mighty God, He who created the heavens and stretched them out, spreading out the earth and its offspring; Who gives breath to the people on it and spirit to those who walk on it.

6. I, Jehovah, have called You in righteousness, and will hold Your hand, and will keep You, and give You as a covenant to the people, as a Light to the nations;

7. to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, those who sit in darkness out of the prison house.

8. I am Jehovah; that is My name; and My glory I will not give to another, nor My praise to graven images.

9. Behold, the former things have come to pass, and new things I declare; before they spring forth, I proclaim them to you.

10. Sing to Jehovah a new song; His praise from the ends of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it; the coastlands and its inhabitants.

11. Let the wilderness and its cities lift up their voice, the villages where Kedar dwells. Let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the mountain tops.

12. Give glory to Jehovah and declare His praise in the coastlands.

13. Jehovah goes forth as a mighty man, He stirs up zeal like a man of war; He shouts, yea, roars; He shows Himself mighty against His enemies.

14. I have continually kept silent; I have been still and refrained Myself. Now I will cry like a woman in labor; I will pant and gasp at once.

15. I will make waste the mountains and hills, and dry up all their vegetation. And I will make the rivers coastlands, and I will dry up the pools.

16. And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths they have not known; I will make darkness into light before them, and crooked places straight. I will do these things for them, and not forsake them.

17. They have been turned back, they are greatly ashamed, those who trust in graven images and who say to the molten images, You are our gods.

18. Hear, you deaf; and look, you blind, that you may see.

19. Who is blind but My servant? Or deaf, as My messenger whom I sent? Who is blind as he who is perfect, and blind as Jehovahs servant?

20. You see many things, but do not observe; opening the ears, but no one hears.

21. Jehovah is well pleased for His righteousness sake; He will magnify the Law and make it honorable.

22. But this is a people robbed and plundered; all of them are snared in holes, and they are hidden in prison houses. They are as prey, and no one delivers them; spoils, and no one says, Give it back!

23. Who among you will give ear to this? Who will listen and hear for the time to come?

24. Who gave Jacob for a spoils, and Israel to robbers? Was it not Jehovah, against whom we have sinned? For they would not walk in His ways, nor did they obey His Law.

25. Therefore He has poured upon him the fury of His anger, and the strength of battle. And it has set him on fire all around, yet he did not know; and it burned him, yet he did not lay it to heart.

## Isaiah 43

1. But now thus says Jehovah who created you, O Jacob, and He who formed you, O Israel; Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by your name; you are Mine.

2. When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned; nor shall the flame consume you.

3. For I am Jehovah your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I gave Egypt for your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for you.

4. Since you were precious in My eyes, you have been honored, and I have loved you; therefore I will give men for you, and people for your life.

5. Fear not, for I am with you. I will bring your seed from the east, and gather you from the west.

6. I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Do not keep back; bring My sons from afar and My daughters from the ends of the earth;

7. everyone who is called by My name; for I have created him for My glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.

8. Bring out the blind people who have eyes, and the deaf who have ears.

9. Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled. Who among them can declare this and cause us to hear former things? Let them bring out their witnesses, that they may be justified; or let them hear, and say, It is true.

10. You are My witnesses, says Jehovah, and My servant whom I have chosen; that you may know and believe Me, and understand that I am He. Before Me no god was formed, nor shall there be after Me.

11. I, even I, am Jehovah; and there is no one to save besides Me.

12. I have declared and have saved, and I have shown, when there was no strange god among you; therefore you are My witnesses, says Jehovah, that I am the Mighty God.

13. Yea, before the day was, I am He; and no one can deliver out of My hand; I work, and who will reverse it?

14. Thus says Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought them all down as fugitives, and the Chaldeans, who shout in their ships.

15. I am Jehovah, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.

16. Thus says Jehovah, Who makes a way in the sea and a path through the mighty waters;

17. Who brings out the chariot and horse, the army and the power: They shall lie down together, they shall not rise; they are extinguished, they are quenched like a wick.

18. Do not remember the former things, nor consider the things of old.

19. Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall you not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.

20. The beasts of the field shall honor Me, the dragons and the young owls; because I give waters in the wilderness, rivers in the desert, to give drink to My people, My elect.

21. This people that I have formed for Myself; they shall declare My praise.

22. But you have not called upon Me, O Jacob; but you have been weary of Me, O Israel.

23. You have not brought Me the lamb of your burnt offerings; nor have you honored Me with your sacrifices. I have not caused you to serve with an offering, nor wearied you with incense.

24. You have bought Me no sweet cane with money, nor have you filled Me with the fat of your sacrifices; but you have burdened Me with your sins; you have wearied Me with your iniquities.

25. I, even I, am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake, and will not remember your sins.

26. Bring to My remembrance; let us enter into judgment together; declare yourself, that you may be justified.

27. Your first father has sinned, and has mocked and rebelled against Me.

28. Therefore I will defile the rulers of the sanctuary, and will give Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.

## Isaiah 44

1. Yet hear now, O Jacob My servant, and Israel whom I have chosen;

2. Thus says Jehovah who made you, and formed you from the womb, who will help you; Fear not, O Jacob My servant, and you, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.

3. For I will pour water on him who is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground. I will pour My spirit upon your seed, and My blessing upon your offspring;

4. and they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the watercourses.

5. One shall say, I am Jehovahs; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall write with his hand, For Jehovah, and be named by the name of Israel.

6. Thus says Jehovah, the King of Israel, and His Redeemer Jehovah of Hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and besides Me there is no God.

7. And who shall proclaim as I do, and shall declare it and set it in order for Me; since I founded the ancient people? And the things that are coming, and shall come; let them declare it to them.

8. Fear not, nor be afraid; have I not told you and declared it since then? Thus, you are My witnesses. Is there a God besides Me? Yea, there is no other rock. I have not known any.

9. Those who make a graven image, all of them are vanity; and the things which they desire shall not help. And they are their own witnesses; they do not see nor know; that they may be ashamed.

10. Who has formed a god or smelted a graven image that benefits nothing?

11. Behold, all his companions shall be ashamed; and the craftsmen, they are men. Let them be gathered together; let them stand up; they shall be in dread; they shall be ashamed together.

12. The craftsman in iron makes it in the coals with the tongs, and fashions it with hammers, and makes it with the strength of his arms. Then, he is hungry, and his strength fails; he drinks no water, and is faint.

13. The craftsman in wood stretches a measuring line; he makes an outline with a marker; he works it with carving tools, and he marks it out with the compass, and makes it like the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man, that it may remain in the house.

14. He cuts down cedars, and takes cypress and oak, which he secures for himself among the trees of the forest. He plants a fir tree, and the rain makes it grow.

15. Then it shall be for a man to burn; for he will take some of it and warm himself. Yes, he kindles it and bakes bread; he also makes a god and bows down to it; he makes it into a graven image and prostrates himself to it.

16. He burns part of it in the fire; with part of it he eats flesh; he roasts a roast and is satisfied; indeed, he warms himself, and says, Ah! I am warm, I have seen the fire.

17. And the rest of it he makes into a god, his graven image. He prostrates himself before it and bows down, and prays to it, and says, Deliver me! for you are my mighty god.

18. They have not known nor understood; for He has shut their eyes so that they cannot see; and their hearts so that they cannot understand.

19. And no one considers within his heart, nor is there perception nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; indeed, also I have baked bread on its coals; I have roasted flesh and eaten; and shall I make the rest of it into an abomination? Shall I prostrate myself to a piece of wood?

20. He feeds on ashes; a deceived heart has turned him aside, so that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is this not a lie in my right hand?

21. Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for you are My servant; I have formed you; you are My servant; O Israel, you shall not be forgotten by Me.

22. I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions, and as a cloud, your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed you.

23. Sing, O heavens; for Jehovah has done it! Shout, you lower parts of the earth! Break forth into singing, you mountains, O forest, and every tree in it! For Jehovah has redeemed Jacob, and glorified Himself in Israel!

24. Thus says Jehovah, your Redeemer, and He who formed you from the womb: I am Jehovah, who makes all things, who stretches out the heavens alone, who spreads out the earth by Myself;

25. who brings to nothing the signs of the liars, and makes diviners mad; who turns the wise backward, and makes their knowledge foolish;

26. who establishes the word of His servant, and performs the counsel of His messengers; who says to Jerusalem, You shall be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, You shall be built, and I will raise up its waste places;

27. who says to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up your rivers;

28. who says of Cyrus, He is My shepherd, and shall do all My pleasure; even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.

## Isaiah 45

1. Thus says Jehovah to His anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have strengthened in order to subdue nations before him. And I will loosen the loins of kings, to open before him the gates; and the gates shall not be shut.

2. I will go before you, and make the high places level and straight. I will break in pieces the gates of bronze, and cut the iron bars in two.

3. And I will give you the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that you may know that I, Jehovah, who calls you by your name, am the God of Israel.

4. For Jacob My servants sake, and Israel My elect, I have even proclaimed your name; I have entitled you, though you have not known Me.

5. I am Jehovah, and there is none other, no God besides Me; I embraced you, though you have not known Me;

6. that they may know from the rising of the sun, to its setting, that there is none besides Me. I am Jehovah, and there is no other;

7. forming the light and creating darkness; making peace and creating evil. I, Jehovah, do all these things.

8. Rain down from above, O heavens, and let the clouds pour down righteousness. Let the earth open, and let salvation bear fruit; and let righteousness spring up together. I, Jehovah, have created it.

9. Woe to him who strives with the One who formed him, a potsherd among the potsherds of the earth! Shall the clay say to the one who forms it, What are you making? Or your work, He has no hands?

10. Woe to him who says to his father, What are you begetting? Or to the woman, What are you writhing over?

11. Thus says Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and the One who formed him, Do you ask Me of things to come? Do you give command to Me about My sons, and about the work of My hands?

12. I have made the earth, and created man on it; I, with My hands, have stretched out the heavens; and all their host have I ordained.

13. I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways; he shall build My city, and he shall set free My captives, not for price nor reward, says Jehovah of Hosts.

14. Thus says Jehovah, The labor of Egypt, and merchandise of Cush, and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come to you, and they shall be yours. They shall follow behind you; and they shall pass over in chains and they shall bow down to you. They shall plead with you, saying, Surely the Mighty God is in you; there is no one else, no other God.

15. Truly You are a Mighty God who hides Yourself, O God of Israel, the Savior.

16. They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them; they who are makers of idols shall go into disgrace together.

17. But Israel shall be saved in Jehovah with an everlasting salvation. You shall not be ashamed nor humiliated to everlasting eternity.

18. For thus says Jehovah who Created the heavens, God who has formed the earth and made it; who has established it, who has not created it void, but has formed it to be inhabited: I am Jehovah, and there is no other.

19. I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth. I did not say to the seed of Jacob, Seek me in vain. I, Jehovah, speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.

20. Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, you who have escaped from the nations. Those who set up the wood of their graven image, and those that pray to a god that cannot save, they know nothing.

21. Declare and approach; yea, let them take counsel together. Who has declared this from antiquity? Who has told it since then? Is it not I, Jehovah. And there is no other God besides Me; a just Mighty God and a Savior; there is no one besides Me.

22. Turn to Me, and be saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am the Mighty God, and there is no other.

23. I have sworn by Myself, the word has gone out of My mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, that to Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.

24. One shall say, Only in Jehovah do I have righteousness and strength; to Him men shall come. And they shall be ashamed, all who are angry with Him.

25. In Jehovah shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.

## Isaiah 46

1. Bel bows down, Nebo stoops; their idols were on the beasts and on the cattle; the things you carried have become a load, a burden to the weary.

2. They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but they themselves have gone into captivity.

3. Listen to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, who were carried by Me from the belly, who were sustained from the womb;

4. even to your old age, I am He; and to the gray hairs I will bear you. I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.

5. To whom will you compare Me, and make Me equal; and compare Me, that we may be alike?

6. They pour gold out of the bag, and weigh silver out on the measuring rod, and hire a goldsmith; and he makes it into a god; they prostrate themselves, yea, they bow down.

7. They carry it on the shoulder, they carry it and set it in its place, and it stands; it shall not move from its place. Yes, one shall cry unto it, yet it cannot answer, nor save him out of his trouble.

8. Remember this, and be a man; refresh the memory of your heart, you who rebel.

9. Remember the former things from a long time ago; for I am the Mighty God, and there is no other; I am God, and no one else is like Me,

10. declaring the end from the beginning, and from antiquity things which are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all My pleasure;

11. calling a bird of prey from the east, the man who executes my counsel from a distant land. Indeed, I have spoken it; I will also bring it to pass. I have formed it; I will also do it.

12. Listen to me, you stubborn-hearted, who are far from righteousness;

13. I bring near My righteousness. It shall not be far off, and My salvation shall not delay. And I will place salvation in Zion, My glory for Israel.

## Isaiah 47

1. Come down and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground. There is no throne for you, O daughter of the Chaldeans. For you shall no more be called tender and delicate.

2. Take the millstones and grind meal. Uncover your veil, strip off the skirt, bare the thigh, pass through the rivers.

3. Your nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, your shame shall be seen; I will take vengeance and I will not meet you as a man.

4. Our Redeemer, Jehovah of Hosts is His name, the Holy One of Israel.

5. Sit in silence, and go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for you shall no more be called the Queen of Kingdoms.

6. I was angry with My people, I have polluted My inheritance, and given them into your hand. You have shown them no mercy; upon the aged you have laid your yoke very heavily.

7. And you said, I shall be a queen forever; so you did not lay these things to heart, nor remember the latter end of it.

8. Now therefore hear this, O voluptuous one, who lives securely; who says in her heart, I am, and there is no one else besides me; I shall not sit as a widow, nor shall I know the loss of children.

9. But these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day: The loss of children, and widowhood. They shall come upon you in their fullness for the multitude of your sorceries, and for the great power of your enchantments.

10. For you have trusted in your wickedness; you have said, No one sees me. Your wisdom and your knowledge have perverted you; and you have said in your heart, I am, and there is no one else besides me.

11. Therefore evil shall come upon you, and you shall not know its origin. And disaster shall fall upon you, and you shall not be able to cover it over. And desolation shall come upon you suddenly, which you shall not be informed of.

12. Stand now with your charms, and with the multitude of your sorceries, in which you have labored since your youth. Perhaps you will be able to profit; perhaps you may prevail.

13. You are wearied by your many counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers and the fortunetellers step forth and save you from what shall come upon you.

14. Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them. They shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame; it shall not be a coal to be warmed with; nor a fire in front of which to sit.

15. Thus shall they be to you with whom you have labored, your merchants from your youth. They shall wander, each one, to his own region; no one shall save you.

## Isaiah 48

1. Hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and have come forth out of the waters of Judah; who swear by the name of Jehovah and make mention of the God of Israel (but not in truth nor in righteousness;

2. for they name themselves as being of the holy city, and rest themselves on the God of Israel; Jehovah of Hosts is His name):

3. I have declared the former things from the beginning, and they proceeded forth out of My mouth, and I proclaimed to them. I acted suddenly, and they came to pass,

4. because I knew that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew and your brow bronze.

5. I even declared it to you from the beginning. Before it happened I proclaimed it to you, lest you should say, My idol has done them, and my graven image and my molten image has commanded them.

6. You have heard; see all this. And will you not declare it? I have shown you new things from this time, even hidden things, and you did not know them.

7. They are created now, and not since the beginning; even before the day when you did not hear them; lest you should say, Behold, I knew them.

8. Surely you did not hear, surely you did not know; surely from long ago your ear was not opened. For I knew that you would deceive with treachery, and were called a transgressor from the womb.

9. For My names sake I will prolong My anger, and for My praise I will restrain for you, so that I do not cut you off.

10. Behold, I have refined you, but not with silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.

11. For my own sake, for My own sake I will do it; for why should My name be defiled? And I will not give My glory to another.

12. Listen to me O Jacob, and Israel My called; I am He; I am the first, I also am the last.

13. My hand also has laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand has stretched out the heavens. When I called to them, they stood up together.

14. Let all of you gather and hear. Who among them has declared these things? Jehovah has loved him; He will do as He pleases upon Babylon, and His arm shall be upon the Chaldeans.

15. I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him; I have brought him and made his way prosperous.

16. Come near to Me, hear this: I have not spoken in secret from the beginning. From the time it existed, I was there; and now the Lord Jehovah, and His Spirit, has sent Me.

17. Thus says Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am Jehovah your God, who teaches you to profit, who leads you by the way that you should go.

18. Oh that you had paid attention to My commandments! Then your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.

19. Your seed also would have been like the sand, and the offspring of your womb like grains of sand; his name would not have been cut off nor destroyed from before My face.

20. Go out from Babylon! Flee from the Chaldeans! Declare it with a resounding voice! Proclaim this; let it go forth to the ends of the earth! Say, Jehovah has redeemed His servant, Jacob!

21. And they did not thirst when He led them through the deserts; He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; He split open the rock also, and the waters gushed out.

22. There is no peace, says Jehovah, unto the wicked.

## Isaiah 49

1. Listen to Me, O coastlands; and give attention, you people from afar; Jehovah has called Me from the womb; from My mothers belly He has made mention of My name.

2. And He has made My mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of His hand He has hidden Me, and made Me a polished shaft. He has hidden Me in His quiver,

3. and said to Me, You are My servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.

4. Then I said, I have labored in vain; I have spent My strength for nothing, and in vain; yet surely My just due is with Jehovah, and My work with My God.

5. And now, says Jehovah who formed Me from the womb to be His servant, to bring Jacob back to Him: Though Israel is not gathered, yet I shall be glorious in the eyes of Jehovah, and My God shall be My strength.

6. And He said, It is but a little thing that You should be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to bring back the preserved ones of Israel; I will also give You for a light to the nations, to be My salvation to the ends of the earth.

7. Thus says Jehovah, the Redeemer of Israel, His Holy One, to Him whom man despises, to Him whom the nation loathes, the Servant of rulers: Kings shall see and arise, rulers also shall bow down, because of Jehovah who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, and He shall choose You.

8. Thus says Jehovah: In a favorable time I have answered You, and in a day of salvation I have helped You; and I will preserve You, and give You as a covenant to the people, to establish the earth, to cause them to inherit the desolate possessions;

9. that You may say to the prisoners, Go out! To those who are in darkness, Show yourselves! They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be on all the barren heights.

10. They shall not hunger nor thirst; nor shall the heat nor sun strike them; for He who has mercy on them will lead them; even by the springs of water He will guide them.

11. And I will make all My mountains a way, and My highways shall be elevated.

12. Behold, these shall come from afar; and, lo, those from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.

13. Sing, O heavens! Be joyful, O earth! And break out into singing, O mountains! For the Lord has comforted His people, and will have mercy on His afflicted.

14. But Zion said, Jehovah has forsaken me, and my Lord has forgotten me.

15. Can a woman forget her nursing infant, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Indeed, they may forget; yet I will not forget you.

16. Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of My hands; your walls are perpetually before Me.

17. Your children shall make haste; those destroying you and laying waste to you shall go out from you.

18. Lift up your eyes all around and see; they all gather and come to you. As I live, says Jehovah, you shall surely wear them as an ornament, and bind them on you as a bride does.

19. For your waste and desolate places, and the land of your destruction, shall even now be too constricted to dwell there, and those who swallowed you up shall be far away.

20. The sons of your bereavement shall yet say in your ears, The place is too narrow for me; let a place come to me so that I may have room to dwell.

21. Then you shall say in your heart, Who has begotten these for me, since I am bereaved, and desolate, removed into exile. And who has raised up these? Behold, I was left alone. But these, where were they?

22. Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will lift up My hand to the nations, and set up My banner to the people; and they shall bring your sons in their bosom, and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.

23. And kings shall be your foster fathers, and their queens your wet nurses. They shall bow down to you, with faces to the earth, and lick up the dust of your feet. And you shall know that I am Jehovah; for they who wait for Me shall not be ashamed.

24. Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?

25. But thus says Jehovah, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the ruthless shall escape. For I will contend with him who contends with you, and I will save your children.

26. And I will feed those who oppress you, with their own flesh; and they shall be drunk with their own blood, as with sweet wine; and all flesh shall know that I, Jehovah, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.

## Isaiah 50

1. Thus says Jehovah, Where is your mothers certificate of divorce, whom I have put away? Or to which of My creditors have I sold you? Behold, you have been sold for your iniquities, and your mother has been put away for your sins.

2. Why, when I came, was no one here? I called and no one answered. Is My hand shortened at all so that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at My rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness; their fish stink, because there is no water, and die of thirst.

3. I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.

4. The Lord Jehovah has given Me the tongue of the learned, to know how to speak a word in season to the weary. He wakens morning by morning, He wakens the ear to hear as the learned.

5. The Lord Jehovah has opened My ear, and I was not rebellious, nor turned away backwards.

6. I gave My back to those who strike, and My cheeks to those who pluck; I hid not My face from shame and spitting.

7. For the Lord Jehovah will help Me; therefore I have not been ashamed. Therefore I have set My face like flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.

8. He is near who justifies Me; who will contend with Me? Let us stand together; who is the master of My judgment? Let him come near Me.

9. Behold, the Lord Jehovah will help Me; who is he who shall condemn Me? Lo, they all shall wear out like a garment; the moth shall eat them.

10. Who among you fears Jehovah? Who obeys the voice of His Servant? Who walks in darkness and has no light? Let him trust in the name of Jehovah and rest on his God.

11. Behold, all you who kindle a fire, who are surrounded with sparks; walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks which you have kindled. This you shall have from My hand; you shall lie down in sorrow.

## Isaiah 51

1. Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness, who seek Jehovah: Look to the rock from which you have been hewn, and to the hole of the pit from which you have been dug.

2. Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah who bore you; for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.

3. For Jehovah will comfort Zion; He will comfort all her waste places; and He will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of Jehovah. Joy and gladness shall be found in it, thanksgiving and the voice of melody.

4. Listen to Me, My people; and give ear to Me, O My nation; for a law shall go out from Me, and I will make My justice to rest for a light of the people.

5. My righteousness is near; My salvation has gone forth, and My arms shall judge the people; the coastlands shall wait upon Me, and on My arm they shall trust.

6. Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look on the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall become old like a garment; and its inhabitants shall die in the same way. But My salvation shall be forever, and My righteousness shall not be broken.

7. Listen to me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is My Law; do not fear the reproach of men, nor be afraid of their revilings.

8. For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool; but My righteousness shall be forever, and My salvation from generation to generation.

9. Awake! awake! Put on strength, O arm of Jehovah. Awake, as in the days of antiquity, in the generations of old. Was it not You who cut Rahab into pieces, wounding the dragon?

10. Was it not You who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?

11. Therefore the redeemed of Jehovah shall return and come with singing into Zion; and everlasting joy shall be on their head. Gladness and joy shall overtake them; sorrow and mourning shall flee away.

12. I, even I, am He who comforts you. Who are you, that you should fear a man, who shall die; or the son of man, who shall be made as grass?

13. And you forget Jehovah your Maker, who has stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth. And you dread continually, every day, because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy. And where is the fury of the oppressor?

14. Stooped over he hurries to be loosed, so that he should not die in the pit, nor lack his bread.

15. But I am Jehovah your God, who divided the sea, whose waves roared; Jehovah of Hosts is His name.

16. And I have put My Words in your mouth, and I have covered you in the shadow of My hand, that I may plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth, and say to Zion, You are My people.

17. Awake! Awake! Rise up, O Jerusalem, who has drunk the cup of His fury from the hand of Jehovah; you have drunk the dregs of the cup of staggering, and wrung them out.

18. There is no one to guide her among all the sons she has borne; and no one takes her by the hand of all the sons that she has raised.

19. These two things have come upon you, who shall be sorry for you? Desolation, and destruction, and famine, and the sword. By whom shall I comfort you?

20. Your sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets like a wild animal in a net, filled with the fury of Jehovah, the rebuke of your God.

21. Therefore now hear this, you afflicted one, and drunk, but not with wine.

22. Thus says your Lord, Jehovah, and your God who pleads the case of His people: Behold, I have taken the cup of staggering out of your hand, even the dregs of the cup of My fury; you shall never drink it again.

23. But I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you, who have said to your soul, Bow down so that we may pass over; and lay your back on the ground, even as the street, for those who cross over.

## Isaiah 52

1. Awake! Awake! Put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful robes, O Jerusalem, the Holy City. For never again shall the uncircumcised and unclean come into you.

2. Shake yourself from the dust; rise up! Sit down, Jerusalem! Loose yourself from your neckbands, O captive daughter of Zion.

3. For thus says Jehovah, You have sold yourselves for nothing; and you shall be redeemed without silver.

4. For thus says the Lord Jehovah, My people went down before into Egypt to stay there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.

5. Now therefore, what have I here, says Jehovah, that My people are taken away for nothing? Those who rule make them howl, says Jehovah; and My name is continually blasphemed every day.

6. Therefore My people shall know My name. Thus it shall be in that day, for I am He who speaks; behold, it is I.

7. How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him bringing good tidings, proclaiming peace; bringing good news, proclaiming salvation; who says to Zion, Your God reigns!

8. Your watchmen shall lift up the voice! They shall lift up the voice together in a resounding cry; for they shall see eye to eye, when Jehovah brings Zion back.

9. Break forth together into a resounding cry of joy, you waste places of Jerusalem! For Jehovah has comforted His people; He has redeemed Jerusalem.

10. Jehovah has bared His holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.

11. Depart! Depart! Go out from there! Touch not the unclean. Go out of her midst; purify yourselves, you who bear the vessels of Jehovah.

12. For you shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight; for Jehovah will go before you; and the God of Israel gathers you.

13. Behold, My Servant shall deal with insight; He shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.

14. Just as many were astonished at You (His appearance was disfigured more than any man, and His form more than the sons of mankind);

15. so shall He sprinkle many nations. Kings shall shut their mouths at Him; for that which had not been told to them, they shall see; and what they had not heard, they shall consider.

## Isaiah 53

1. Who has believed Our report? And to whom has the arm of Jehovah been revealed?

2. For He grows up before Him as a tender plant, and as a root out of the dry ground. He has no form nor splendor that we should regard Him, nor anything spectacular that we should desire Him.

3. He is despised and rejected by men; a Man of pain, and knowing infirmity; a hiding of faces; being despised, we have esteemed Him not.

4. Truly He has borne our sicknesses, and carried our pain; yet we esteemed Him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.

5. But He was wounded for our transgressions; He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed.

6. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned, each one to his own way; and Jehovah has laid upon Him the iniquity of us all.

7. He has been oppressed, and He was afflicted; yet He opens not His mouth. He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter; and as a sheep before its shearers is mute, so He opens not His mouth.

8. He was taken from prison and from judgment; and who shall declare His generation? For He was cut off out of the land of the living; for the transgression of My people He was stricken.

9. And His grave was assigned with the wicked, and with the rich in His death; although He had done no violence, nor was any deceit in His mouth.

10. Yet it pleased Jehovah to crush Him; to grieve Him; that He should give His soul as a sin-offering. He shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days, and the delight of Jehovah shall prosper in His hand.

11. He shall see the travail of His soul, and shall be fulfilled. By His knowledge shall My righteous Servant justify many; for He shall bear their iniquities.

12. Therefore I will apportion to Him with the great, and He shall divide the spoils with the strong; because He has poured out His soul unto death; and He was reckoned among the transgressors; and He bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

## Isaiah 54

1. Rejoice, O barren one, you who have not borne; break forth into screams of delight, you who have not writhed in pangs. For more are the children of the desolate than the children of the one who is married, says Jehovah.

2. Enlarge the place of your tent, and let them stretch out the curtains of your dwellings. Do not spare, lengthen your cords and strengthen your stakes;

3. for you shall burst forth on the right hand and on the left. And your seed shall inherit the nations, and make the desolate cities inhabited.

4. Do not fear, for you shall not be ashamed; nor be humiliated, for you shall not be put to shame. For you shall forget the shame of your youth, and shall not remember the reproach of your widowhood any more.

5. For your Maker is your husband; Jehovah of Hosts is His name; and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel. He shall be called, GOD OF THE WHOLE EARTH.

6. For Jehovah has called you as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, like a wife of youth, when you were rejected, says your God.

7. For a brief moment I have left you; but with great mercies I will gather you.

8. In overflowing wrath I hid My face from you for a moment; but with everlasting kindness I will have mercy upon you, says Jehovah your Redeemer.

9. For this is like the waters of Noah to Me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should never again overflow the earth, so I have sworn to not be angry with you, nor rebuke you.

10. For the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed, but My kindness shall not depart from you, nor shall My covenant of peace be removed, says Jehovah, who has mercy on you.

11. O you afflicted one, storm-tossed and not comforted, behold, I will lay your stones with colorful gems, and lay your foundations with sapphires.

12. And I will make your pinnacles of ruby, and your gates of sparkling stones, and all your borders of delightful stones.

13. And all your children shall be taught of Jehovah, and great shall be the peace of your children.

14. In righteousness you shall be established; you shall be far from oppression; for you shall not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near you.

15. Indeed, they shall surely gather together, but not by Me; whoever shall gather against you, by you he shall fall.

16. Behold, I have created the smith who blows the coals in the fire, and who brings out a tool for his work; and I have created the one who ruins to destroy.

17. No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment, you shall condemn. This is the inheritance of the servants of Jehovah, and their righteousness is from Me, says Jehovah.

## Isaiah 55

1. Ho, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and he who has no money, come, buy and eat. Yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.

2. Why do you weigh out money for what is not bread, and your labor for what does not satisfy? Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.

3. Extend your ear, and come to Me; hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.

4. Behold, I have given him as a witness to the people, a leader and commander of people.

5. Behold, you shall call a nation that you do not know, and nations that did not know you shall run to you because of Jehovah your God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for He has glorified you.

6. Seek Jehovah while He may be found; call upon Him while He is near.

7. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to Jehovah, and He will have mercy on him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.

8. For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways, says Jehovah.

9. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.

10. For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, and does not return there, but waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and bud, and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater;

11. so shall My Word be, which goes forth from My mouth; it shall not return to Me void, but it shall accomplish what I please, and it shall succeed in that for which I have sent it.

12. For you shall go out with joy, and be led out with peace; the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into praise, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.

13. Instead of the thorn, the fir tree shall come up; and instead of the brier, the myrtle tree shall come up; and it shall be to Jehovah for a name, for a perpetual sign that shall not be cut off.

## Isaiah 56

1. Thus says Jehovah, Keep justice and do righteousness; for My salvation is near to come, and My righteousness to be revealed.

2. Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who lays hold on it; who keeps from defiling the sabbath, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.

3. And do not let the son of the foreigner, who has joined himself to Jehovah, speak, saying, Jehovah has utterly separated me from His people. And do not let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.

4. For thus says Jehovah to the eunuchs who keep My Sabbaths, and choose what pleases Me, and hold fast to My covenant:

5. Even to them will I give within My house and within My walls a share and a name better than that of sons and of daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.

6. Also the children of the foreigner, who join themselves to Jehovah to serve Him, and to love the name of Jehovah, to be His servants, everyone who keeps from defiling the Sabbath, and holds fast to My covenant:

7. Even them I will bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on My altar; for My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations.

8. Thus says the Lord Jehovah who gathers the outcasts of Israel, Yet I will gather to him others besides those who are gathered to him.

9. All you beasts of the field, come to devour, all you beasts in the forest.

10. His watchmen are blind; they are all ignorant; they are all dumb dogs who cannot bark, dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.

11. Yea, they are greedy dogs which never have enough. And they are shepherds who cannot understand; they all look to their own way, every one for his own gain, to his own end.

12. They say, Come, let us get wine and binge on strong drink; and tomorrow shall be like today; much more abundant.

## Isaiah 57

1. The righteous perishes, and no one lays it to heart, and merciful men are taken away; no one considers that the righteous is taken away from the face of evil.

2. He shall enter into peace; they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.

3. But draw near here, you sons of the sorceress, you seed of the adulterer and the harlot.

4. Of whom do you make sport? Against whom do you make a wide mouth and stick out the tongue? Are you not children of transgression, a seed of deception,

5. being inflamed with gods under every green tree, slaughtering the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks?

6. Among the smooth stones of the stream is your portion; they, even they, are your lot; even to them you have poured a drink offering, you have offered a food offering. Should I be comforted over these?

7. On a lofty and high mountain you have set your bed; even there you went up to offer sacrifice.

8. Also behind the doors and the posts you have set up your memorials; for you uncovered yourself and went up to those other than Me. You enlarged your bed and made a covenant with them; you have loved to experience their bed first hand.

9. And you went to the king with ointment, and increased your perfumes, and sent your messengers far away, and lowered yourself even to Sheol.

10. You are wearied in the length of your way; yet you did not say, There is no hope! You found life in your hand; therefore you were not weak.

11. And of whom have you been afraid or feared, that you have lied and have not remembered Me, nor laid it to your heart? Have I not been silent, even for a long time, and you did not fear Me?

12. I will declare your righteousness, and your works; for they shall not be of any benefit to you.

13. When you cry out, let your collection of idols deliver you; but the wind shall carry them all away; a breath shall take them. But he who puts his trust in Me shall possess the land, and shall inherit My holy mountain.

14. And He shall say, Raise up! Raise up! Clear a path! Remove the stumbling block out of the way of My people.

15. For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and consecrated place, even with the contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.

16. For I will not contend forever, nor will I always be angry; for the spirit would grow faint before Me, and the souls I have made.

17. For the iniquity of his covetousness I was angry and struck him; I hid Myself and was angry, and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.

18. I have seen his ways, and will heal him. I will also lead him, and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.

19. I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him who is far off, and to him who is near, says Jehovah; and I will heal him.

20. But the wicked are like the troubled sea, which cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.

21. There is no peace, says my God, to the wicked.

## Isaiah 58

1. Cry aloud, do not spare; lift up your voice like a shofar, and declare to My people their transgression, and to the house of Jacob their sins.

2. Yet they seek Me daily, and delight to know My ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and did not forsake the ordinance of their God. They ask of Me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in drawing near to God.

3. They say, Why have we fasted, and You do not see? Why have we afflicted our souls, and You take no notice? Behold, in the day of your fast you devise pleasures, and oppress all your laborers.

4. Behold, you fast for strife and contention, and to strike with the fist of wickedness; you shall not fast as you do today, to make your voice heard on high.

5. Is it such a fast that I have chosen? A day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head like a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will you call this a fast and a day pleasing to Jehovah?

6. Is not this the fast that I have chosen: To loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke?

7. Is it not to break your bread to the hungry, and that you should bring home the wandering poor? When you see the naked to cover him; and not hide yourself from your own flesh?

8. Then shall your light break forth as the dawn, and your health shall spring forth speedily; and your righteousness shall go before you; the glory of Jehovah shall bring up the rear.

9. Then you shall call, and Jehovah will answer; you shall cry out, and He shall say, Here I am. If you take the yoke away from your midst, the pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness;

10. and if you extend your soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall your light shine in the darkness, and your darkness shall be as the noonday.

11. And Jehovah shall guide you continually and satisfy your soul in dry places, and make your bones fat; and you shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.

12. And those from among you shall build the old ruins; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; and you shall be called, The Repairer of the Breach, The Restorer of Paths to Dwell in.

13. If you turn back your foot, on the Sabbath, from doing what you please on My holy days, and call the Sabbath a delight, the sacred of Jehovah, honorable; and shall honor Him, not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking your own words,

14. then you shall delight yourself in Jehovah; and I will cause you to ride on the high places of the earth, and feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father. The mouth of Jehovah has spoken.

## Isaiah 59

1. Behold, Jehovahs hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; nor is His ear heavy, that it cannot hear.

2. But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hidden His face from you, that He will not hear.

3. For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue has uttered perverseness.

4. No one calls for justice, nor does anyone plead for truth; they trust in vanity and speak lies. They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity.

5. They hatch vipers eggs and weave the spiders web; he who eats their eggs dies, and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.

6. Their webs shall not become garments, nor shall they cover themselves with their works; their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.

7. Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; devastation and destruction are in their paths.

8. The way of peace they have not known, and there is no justice in their paths. They have made crooked paths for themselves; whoever goes in them shall not know peace.

9. Therefore justice is far from us; nor does righteousness overtake us. We wait for daylight, but behold, the night; for brightness, but we walk in darkness.

10. We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes. We stumble at noonday as in the night; we are in desolate places like dead men.

11. We all roar like bears, and mourn with moaning like doves; we look for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.

12. For our transgressions are multiplied before You, and our sins testify against us. For our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them;

13. in transgressing and lying against Jehovah, and backsliding from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.

14. And justice is driven back, and righteousness stands afar off; for truth has fallen in the street, and uprightness cannot enter.

15. Yea, truth fails; and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. And Jehovah saw it, and it displeased Him that there was no justice.

16. And He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor. Therefore His own arm brought salvation unto Him; and His righteousness, it sustained Him.

17. For He put on righteousness like a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on His head. And He put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was covered with zeal as a cloak.

18. According to their deeds, accordingly He will repay; fury to His adversaries, recompense to His enemies. He will completely repay their deeds to the coastlands.

19. So shall they fear the name of Jehovah from the west, and His glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of Jehovah shall drive him out.

20. And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to those who turn from transgression in Jacob, says Jehovah.

21. As for Me, this is My covenant with them, says Jehovah; My Spirit that is upon you, and My Words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seeds seed, says Jehovah, from now on and forever.

## Isaiah 60

1. Arise, shine; for your light has come, and the glory of Jehovah has risen upon you.

2. For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people; but Jehovah shall arise over you, and His glory shall be seen upon you.

3. And the nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawning.

4. Lift up your eyes all around, and see. All of them gather themselves; they come to you. Your sons shall come from afar, and your daughters shall be carried on the side.

5. Then you shall be in awe and become radiant, and your heart shall tremble and swell for joy; because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you, the wealth of the nations shall come unto you.

6. A multitude of camels shall overwhelm you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah. All those from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall proclaim the praises of Jehovah.

7. All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you; the rams of Nebajoth shall minister to you. They shall come up on My altar and be acceptable to Me, and I will glorify the house of My glory.

8. Who are these who fly like a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?

9. Surely the coastlands shall wait for Me, and the ships of Tarshish will come first, to bring your children from afar, their silver and their gold with them, to the name of Jehovah your God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because He has glorified you.

10. And the sons of foreigners shall build up your walls, and their kings shall serve you; for in My wrath I struck you, but in My favor I have had mercy upon you.

11. Therefore your gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day or night, to bring to you the wealth of the nations, and that their kings may be led.

12. For the nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish. Yes, those nations will be wasted unto desolation.

13. The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box tree together, to beautify the place of My sanctuary; and I will make the place of My feet glorious.

14. Also the sons of those who afflicted you shall come bowing to you; and all those who despised you shall prostrate themselves at the soles of your feet. And they shall call you, The City of Jehovah, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.

15. Whereas you were forsaken and hated, so that no one passed through, I will make you a perpetual majesty, a joy of many generations.

16. You shall also suck the milk of the nations, and suckle the breast of kings; and you shall know that I, Jehovah, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.

17. Instead of bronze I will bring gold, and instead of iron I will bring silver; and instead of wood I will bring bronze, and instead of stones, iron. I will also make your officers peace, and your overseers righteousness.

18. Violence shall no more be heard in your land, neither devastation nor destruction within your borders; but you shall call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise.

19. The sun shall no more be your light by day; nor the brightness of the moon give light to you; but Jehovah will be to you an everlasting light, and your God your glory.

20. Your sun shall not go down any more, nor shall your moon withdraw itself; for Jehovah will be your everlasting light, and the days of your mourning shall be ended.

21. Your people also shall all be righteous; they shall inherit the land forever, the branch of My planting, the work of My hands, so that I may be glorified.

22. A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I, Jehovah, will hasten it in its time.

## Isaiah 61

1. The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon Me; because Jehovah has anointed Me to preach the Gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;

2. to proclaim the acceptable year of Jehovah and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn;

3. to appoint to those who mourn in Zion, to give to them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the mantle of praise for the spirit of heaviness; so that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah, that He might be glorified.

4. And they shall rebuild the old wastes, they shall raise up what was formerly desolated. And they shall repair the waste cities, what lay desolate for many generations.

5. And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.

6. But you shall be named, The Priests of Jehovah; and they shall call you, Ministers of our God. You shall eat the riches of the nations, and you shall revel in their glory.

7. Instead of your shame you shall have double; and instead of reproach they shall rejoice in their portion. Therefore in their own land they shall possess double; everlasting joy shall be theirs.

8. For I, Jehovah, love justice; I hate stolen things for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.

9. And their seed shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the people; all who see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed Jehovah has blessed.

10. I will greatly rejoice in Jehovah, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for He has clothed me with the garment of salvation, He has covered me with the robe of righteousness like a bridegroom adorns himself with ornaments, and like a bride adorns herself with her jewels.

11. For as the earth brings forth its bud, and as the garden causes that which is sown to grow; so the Lord Jehovah will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.

## Isaiah 62

1. For Zions sake I will not be silent, and for Jerusalems sake I will not rest, until its righteousness goes forth as brightness, and her salvation as a burning lamp.

2. And the nations shall see your righteousness, and all kings your glory; and you shall be called by a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah will name.

3. You also shall be a crown of glory in the hand of Jehovah, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.

4. You shall no more be called Forsaken; nor shall your land any more be called Desolate; but you shall be called My Delight Is In Her, and your land, Married; for Jehovah delights in you, and your land is married.

5. For as a young man marries a virgin, so shall your sons marry you; and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so will your God rejoice over you.

6. I have set watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem, who shall never be silent day or night; you who remember Jehovah, do not keep silent.

7. And give Him no rest until He establishes and makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.

8. Jehovah has sworn by His right hand, and by the arm of His strength: Surely I will no more give your grain as food for your enemies; and the children of foreigners shall not drink your wine for which you have labored.

9. But those who gathered it shall eat it, and praise Jehovah; and those who brought it together shall drink it in My holy courts.

10. Pass! Pass through the gates! Prepare the way for the people. Raise up! Raise up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a banner for the people.

11. Behold, Jehovah has proclaimed to the ends of the earth, Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your salvation comes. Behold, His reward is with Him, and His work before Him.

12. And they shall call them, The Holy People, The Redeemed Of Jehovah; and you shall be called, Sought Out, A City Not Forsaken.

## Isaiah 63

1. Who is this who comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah, this One adorned in His apparel, flexing His great strength? I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save.

2. Why is Your apparel red, and Your garments like one who treads in the winepress?

3. I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples there was no one with Me; for I tread them in My anger and trample them in My fury, and their blood is sprinkled on My garments, and I have stained all My apparel.

4. For the day of vengeance is in My heart, and the year of My redeemed has come.

5. And I looked, and there was no one to help; and I wondered that there was no one to uphold; therefore My own arm has given victory for Me; and My fury sustained Me.

6. And I will tread down the people in My anger, and make them drunk in My fury, and I will bring down their blood to the earth.

7. I will mention the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah, the praises of Jehovah, according to all that Jehovah has bestowed upon us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel which He has bestowed upon them according to His mercies, and according to the multitude of His lovingkindnesses.

8. For He said, Surely they are My people, children that will not lie; so He was their Savior.

9. In all their affliction He was afflicted, and the Angel of His Presence saved them; in His love and in His pity He redeemed them; and He bore them, and carried them all the days of old.

10. But they rebelled, and grieved His Holy Spirit; therefore He changed, to be their enemy, and He fought against them.

11. Then He remembered the days of old, Moses and His people, saying, Where is He who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of His flock? Where is He who put His Holy Spirit within him;

12. who led them by the right hand of Moses with His glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make for Himself an everlasting name?

13. He led them through the deep, like a horse in the wilderness, so that they might not stumble.

14. As a beast goes down into the valley, the Spirit of Jehovah caused him to rest. So You led Your people, to make for Yourself a glorious name.

15. Look down from Heaven, and look down from the place of Your holiness and of Your glory. Where is Your zeal and Your strength, the multitude of Your tender affections and of Your mercies toward me? Are they restrained?

16. Indeed, You are our Father, though Abraham does not know us, and Israel does not acknowledge us. You, O Jehovah, are our Father, our Redeemer; Your name is from everlasting.

17. O Jehovah, why have You made us wander from Your ways, and hardened our heart from Your fear? For the sake of Your servants, return the tribes of Your inheritance.

18. The people of Your holiness have possessed it but a little while; our enemies have trampled Your sanctuary.

19. We are from antiquity; You never ruled over them; they were never called by Your name.

## Isaiah 64

1. Oh that You would rend the heavens and come down! That the mountains would quake at Your presence,

2. as the brushwood fire burns, as the fire causes water to boil; to make Your name known to Your adversaries, that the nations may tremble at Your presence!

3. When You did awesome things which we did not look for, You came down, the mountains shook at Your presence.

4. For since ancient times they have not heard, nor been obedient. Eye has not seen any god besides You, who works for him who waits for Him.

5. You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, those who remember You in Your ways (Behold, You were angry, for we sinned continually), and we shall be saved.

6. But we are all like an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are like a menstruation cloth. And we all fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.

7. And there is no one who calls upon Your name, who stirs up himself to take hold of You. For You have hidden Your face from us, and have melted us away because of our iniquities.

8. But now, O Jehovah, You are our Father; we are the clay, and You are the One who forms us; and we all are the work of Your hand.

9. Do not be greatly furious, O Jehovah, nor remember iniquity forever. Behold, please look. We all are Your people.

10. Your holy cities are a wilderness; Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem is a desolation.

11. Our holy and beautiful house, where our fathers praised You, is burned up with fire; and all our pleasant things are laid waste.

12. Will You restrain Yourself over these things, O Jehovah? Will You be silent and greatly afflict us?

## Isaiah 65

1. I am sought by those who asked not for Me; I am found by those who did not seek Me. I had said, Look to Me, Look to Me; to a nation that was not calling upon My name.

2. I have spread out My hands all the day to a rebellious people who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;

3. a people who continually provoke Me to anger to My face; who sacrifice in gardens, and burn incense on altars of bricks;

4. who remain among the graves, and spend the night in the tombs, who eat swines flesh, and the broth of unclean things in their vessels;

5. who say, Keep to yourself, do not come near me; for I am holier than you. These are a smoke in My nose, a fire that burns all the day.

6. Behold, it is written before Me; I will not be silent, but what I will repay; yea, I will repay into their bosom

7. your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, says Jehovah, who have burned incense on the mountains, and blasphemed Me on the hills. Therefore I will measure their former work into their bosom.

8. Thus says Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, Do not destroy it, for a blessing is in it; so I will do to My servants, that I may not destroy them all.

9. And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah one who inherits My mountains; and My elect shall inherit it, and My servants shall dwell there.

10. And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the Valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down, for My people who have sought Me.

11. But you are those who forsake Jehovah, who forget My holy mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune, and who furnish the drink offering to Fate.

12. Therefore I have assigned you to the sword; and you shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, you did not answer; when I spoke, you did not hear, but did evil before My eyes, and chose that in which I have not delighted.

13. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Behold, My servants will eat, but you shall be hungry. Behold, My servants will drink, but you shall be thirsty. Behold, My servants will rejoice, but you shall be ashamed.

14. Behold, My servants will sing for joy of heart, but you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl because of a crushed spirit.

15. And you shall leave your name as a curse to My elect; for the Lord Jehovah will kill you, and call His servants by another name.

16. He who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth. And he who swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hidden from My eyes.

17. For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth. And the former shall not be remembered, nor come to mind.

18. But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for behold, I create Jerusalem as a rejoicing, and her people as a joy.

19. I have rejoiced in Jerusalem, and exulted in My people. And the voice of weeping shall no more be heard in her, nor the voice of crying.

20. There shall not be an infant of only a few days, nor an old man that has not fulfilled his days. For the child shall die at a hundred years old; but the sinner who is a hundred years old shall be accursed.

21. And they shall build houses and live in them; and they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.

22. They shall not build, and another live in them; they shall not plant, and another eat. For as the days of a tree are the days of My people, and My elect shall grow old enjoying the work of their hands.

23. They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth children for terror. For they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.

24. And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are still speaking, I will hear.

25. The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpents food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, says Jehovah.

## Isaiah 66

1. Thus says Jehovah, Heaven is My throne, and earth My footstool. Where, then, is the house that you would build for Me? And where is the place of My rest?

2. For all those My hand has made, and all those exist, says Jehovah. But to this one will I have regard: To the lowly and contrite of spirit, and the one who trembles at My Word.

3. He who kills an ox is as if he killed a man; he who sacrifices a lamb is as if he broke a dogs neck; he who offers an offering is as if he offered swines blood; he who burns incense is as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations.

4. I also will choose the things that delude them, and I will bring their fears upon them, because when I called, no one answered; when I spoke, they have not obeyed. But they did evil before My eyes and have chosen that in which I have not delighted.

5. Hear the Word of Jehovah, you who tremble at His Word: Your brothers who hated you, who cast you out because of My name, said, Let Jehovah be glorified. But He will appear for your joy, and they shall be ashamed.

6. A roaring sound from the city, a sound from the temple, the sound of Jehovah repaying His enemies.

7. Before she writhed in labor, she gave birth; before her pangs came, she delivered a male child.

8. Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall the earth give birth in one day? Or shall a nation be born at once? For as soon as Zion had gone into labor, she had brought forth her children.

9. Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth, says Jehovah? Shall I beget, and then restrain the womb? says your God.

10. Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you who love her. Rejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn for her;

11. that you may suckle and be satisfied with her comforting breasts; that you may suck milk and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.

12. For thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like a flowing stream. Then you shall suckle, you shall be carried on her sides and be dandled upon her knees.

13. As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you; and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.

14. And you shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the grass. And the hand of Jehovah shall be known toward His servants, and His indignation toward His enemies.

15. For behold, Jehovah will come with fire and with His chariots like a tempest, to refresh His anger with fury, and His rebuke with flames of fire.

16. For by fire and by His sword Jehovah will judge all flesh; and the slain of Jehovah shall be many.

17. Those who sanctify themselves, and purify themselves to go into the garden after an idol that is in its midst, eating swines flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall come to an end together, says Jehovah.

18. For I know their works and their thoughts. It shall come to pass that I will gather all the nations and tongues; and they shall come and see My glory.

19. And I will set a sign among them. And those among them who escape I will send to the nations; to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud (who draw the bow), to Tubal, and Javan; to the far away coasts that have not heard of My fame, nor seen My glory. And they shall declare My glory among the nations.

20. And they shall bring all your brothers for an offering to Jehovah out of all nations on horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on camels, to My holy mountain Jerusalem, says Jehovah, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah.

21. And I will also take some of them for priests and for Levites, says Jehovah.

22. For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before Me, says Jehovah, so shall your seed and your name remain.

23. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, all flesh shall come to bow down before Me, says Jehovah.

24. And they shall go out and observe the dead corpses of the men who have rebelled against Me. For their worm does not die, nor is their fire quenched; and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.
