# Zechariah

## Zechariah 1

1. In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the Word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,

2. Jehovah has been wrathfully angry with your fathers.

3. Therefore say to them, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Turn back to Me, says Jehovah of Hosts, and I will turn back to you, says Jehovah of Hosts.

4. Do not be as your fathers, to whom the former prophets have proclaimed, saying, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Turn back now from your evil ways and your evil doings. But they did not hear nor heed Me, says Jehovah.

5. Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?

6. But My Words and My statutes which I commanded My servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? And they turned back and said, As Jehovah of Hosts purposes to do to us, according to our ways and according to our doings, so He has dealt with us.

7. On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the Word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,

8. I saw by night; and behold, a man riding on a red horse; and he stood among the myrtle trees in the ravine; and behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses.

9. Then I said, My lord, what are these? And the angel who spoke with me said to me, I will show you what these are.

10. And the man who stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are those whom Jehovah has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.

11. And they answered the Angel of Jehovah who stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sits still and is at rest.

12. Then the Angel of Jehovah answered and said, O Jehovah of Hosts, how long will You not have mercy on Jerusalem, and on the cities of Judah, against which You have had indignation these seventy years?

13. And Jehovah answered the angel who talked with me with good words, words of comfort.

14. So the angel who talked with me said to me, Cry out, saying, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion, with a great jealousy.

15. And I am exceedingly angry at the nations at ease; for I was but a little angry, and they helped further the evil.

16. Therefore Jehovah says this: I have returned to Jerusalem with compassion; My house shall be built in it, says Jehovah of Hosts, and a line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.

17. Cry out again, saying, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: My cities shall again overflow with prosperity, and Jehovah shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.

18. Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and, behold, four horns.

19. And I said to the angel who talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.

20. And Jehovah showed me four craftsmen.

21. And I said, What are these coming to do? And He spoke, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man lifts up his head. But these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations who lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.

## Zechariah 2

1. I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and, behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.

2. And I said, Where are you going? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth and what is its length.

3. And, behold, the angel who talked with me went out, and another angel went out to meet him,

4. and said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem will be inhabited like unwalled villages, for the multitude of men and livestock in her midst.

5. For I will be to her a wall of fire all around, and I will be the glory in her midst, declares Jehovah.

6. Ho! Ho! Flee from the land of the north, says Jehovah; for I have scattered you as the four winds of the heavens, declares Jehovah.

7. O Zion! Escape, you who live with the daughter of Babylon.

8. For thus says Jehovah of Hosts: He has sent Me after glory to the nations who plundered you; for he who touches you touches the pupil of His eye.

9. For, behold, I will shake My hand over them, and they shall be spoils for their servants. And you shall know that Jehovah of Hosts has sent Me.

10. Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion. For, lo, I come; and I will dwell in your midst, says Jehovah.

11. And many nations shall be joined to Jehovah in that day, and they shall be My people. And I will dwell in your midst; and you shall know that Jehovah of Hosts has sent Me to you.

12. And Jehovah shall take possession of Judah, His portion in the holy land, and shall again choose Jerusalem.

13. All flesh, be silent before Jehovah. For He is raised up out of His holy habitation.

## Zechariah 3

1. And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to oppose him.

2. And Jehovah said to Satan, Jehovah rebuke you, Satan! Even Jehovah who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked out of the fire?

3. Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the Angel.

4. And He answered and spoke to those who stood before Him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And He said to him, Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with robes of state.

5. And I said, Let them set a clean turban on his head. And they set a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments. And the Angel of Jehovah stood by.

6. And the Angel of Jehovah admonished Joshua, saying,

7. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: If you will walk in My ways, and if you will keep My charge, then you shall also judge My house, and shall also keep My courts, and I will give you places to walk among these who stand by.

8. Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your companions who are sitting before you; for they are men of significance. For, behold, I will bring forth My Servant, the BRANCH.

9. For behold, the stone which I have laid before Joshua, on the one stone are seven eyes. I will engrave its engraving, says Jehovah of Hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.

10. In that day, says Jehovah of Hosts, you shall invite each man his neighbor to sit under the vine and under the fig tree.

## Zechariah 4

1. And the angel who spoke with me returned and awakened me, as a man is awakened out of his sleep.

2. And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I see, and behold, a lampstand, all of gold, with a bowl on top of it, and its seven lamps on it, and seven pipes each to the seven lamps on top;

3. and two olive trees are beside it, one on the right of the bowl, and one on its left.

4. So I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?

5. And the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, Do you not know what these are? And I said, No, my lord.

6. Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the Word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, says Jehovah of Hosts.

7. Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain. And he shall bring forth the capstone with shouts: Grace! Grace to it!

8. Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

9. The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it. And you shall know that Jehovah of Hosts has sent me to you.

10. For who has despised the day of small things? For they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet stone in the hand of Zerubbabel. These seven are the eyes of Jehovah which run to and fro through all the earth.

11. Then I answered and said to him, What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand, and on its left?

12. And I answered again and said to him, What are the two olive branches beside the two golden pipes, emptying the golden oil out of themselves?

13. And he spoke to me, saying, Do you not know what these are? And I said, No, my lord.

14. And he said, These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.

## Zechariah 5

1. And I again lifted up my eyes and looked, and, behold, a flying scroll.

2. And he said to me, What do you see? And I answered, I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits, and its width ten cubits.

3. And he said to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth. For from now on everyone who steals shall be purged out according to it; and everyone who swears from now on shall be purged out according to it.

4. And I will bring it forth, says Jehovah of Hosts. And it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of the one who swears falsely by My name. And it shall remain in the midst of his house and shall make an end to it, and its timber, and its stones.

5. Then the angel who talked with me went out, and said to me, Now lift up your eyes and see what this is that goes forth.

6. And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah that goes forth. And he said, This is their appearance throughout the earth.

7. And, behold, a lead disk was lifted up, and a woman sitting in the middle of the ephah.

8. And he said, This is wickedness. And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah; and he threw the lead stone over its opening.

9. Then I lifted up my eyes and looked. And, behold, two women came out. And the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of the stork. And they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.

10. And I said to the angel who talked with me, Where are they going with the ephah?

11. And he said to me, To build a house for it in the land of Shinar; and it shall be prepared and set there on its own base.

## Zechariah 6

1. And again I lifted up my eyes and looked, and, behold, four chariots were coming from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of bronze.

2. With the first chariot were red horses, and with the second chariot black horses,

3. and with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth dappled and strong horses.

4. And I answered and said to the angel who talked with me, What are these, my lord?

5. And the angel answered and said to me, These are the four spirits of Heaven who go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.

6. The black horses in it go into the land of the north, and the white go after them; and the dappled ones go toward the land of the south.

7. And the strong ones went forth and sought to go, to walk to and fro through the earth. And He said, Go. Walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.

8. And He cried out to me, and spoke to me, saying, Behold, these who go toward the land of the north have given My Spirit rest in the land of the north.

9. And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

10. Take from Heldai, from Tobijah, and from Jedaiah, the exiles who have come from Babylon; and in the same day go and enter into the house of Josiah, the son of Zephaniah.

11. And take silver and gold, and make a crown, and set it on the head of Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.

12. And speak to him, saying, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, saying, Behold, the Man whose name is THE BRANCH. And He shall spring up out of His place, and He shall build the temple of Jehovah.

13. Even He shall build the temple of Jehovah; and He shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule on His throne. And He shall be a priest on His throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between the two of them.

14. And the crown shall be for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah, to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen, the son of Zephaniah.

15. And those from afar shall come and build in the temple of Jehovah. And you shall know that Jehovah of Hosts has sent me to you. And this shall come to pass if you will give heed and obey the voice of Jehovah your God.

## Zechariah 7

1. And in the fourth year of King Darius, the Word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, in the fourth of the ninth month, in Chislev.

2. And Sherezer and Regem-melech, and his men, were sent to Bethel to make supplication before Jehovah,

3. and to speak to the priests who were in the house of Jehovah of Hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, consecrating myself as I have done these many years?

4. Then the Word of Jehovah of Hosts came unto me, saying,

5. Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months, even those seventy years, did you truly fast to Me, even to Me?

6. And when you ate, and when you drank, did you not eat and drink for yourselves?

7. Are not these the Words which Jehovah proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem with her cities all around her were inhabited and prosperous, and the south and the lowlands were inhabited?

8. And the Word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, saying,

9. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, saying, Judge true justice, and show goodness and compassion, everyone to his brother.

10. And do not oppress the widow, or the fatherless, the alien, or the poor. And do not devise evil in your heart, a man against his brother.

11. But they refused to heed, and gave a stubborn shoulder, and they made their ears heavy that they might not hear.

12. And they made their heart adamant so as not to hear the Law and the Words which Jehovah of Hosts has sent by His Spirit through the former prophets. And great wrath came from Jehovah of Hosts.

13. Therefore it has come to pass that, just as He called, and they would not hear; so they called, and I did not hear, says Jehovah of Hosts.

14. But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they did not know. Thus the land is desolate behind them, with no one passing through and returning; for they made the pleasant land a waste.

## Zechariah 8

1. Again the Word of Jehovah of Hosts came, saying,

2. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.

3. Thus says Jehovah: I have returned to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And Jerusalem shall be called a City of Truth, and the mountain of Jehovah of Hosts, the Holy Mountain.

4. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: There shall yet be old men and old women sitting in the streets of Jerusalem; and each man with his staff in his hand because of great age.

5. And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.

6. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, will it also be marvelous in My eyes? says Jehovah of Hosts.

7. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Behold, I will save My people from the land of the rising sun and from the land of the sunset.

8. And I will bring them, and they shall live in the midst of Jerusalem. And they shall be My people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.

9. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Let your hands become strong, you who hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, that in the day the foundation of the house of Jehovah of Hosts is laid, the temple is to be built.

10. For before these days there were no wages for man, nor any payment for animal; and there was no peace for those who went out or came in because of the enemy. For I sent every man, a man against his neighbor.

11. But now I will not be to the remnant of this people as in former days, says Jehovah of Hosts.

12. For there shall be peace for the seed: the vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its fruit, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these.

13. And it shall come to pass, that as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and you shall be a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands become strong.

14. For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, As I purposed to punish you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath, says Jehovah of Hosts, and I did not show compassion,

15. so again I have purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem, and the house of Judah. Do not fear.

16. These are the things that you shall do. Every man speak the truth with his neighbor. Judge truth, justice and peace in your gates,

17. and let none of you devise evil in your heart against his neighbor, and do not love a false oath. For all these things I hate, says Jehovah.

18. And the Word of Jehovah of Hosts came unto me, saying,

19. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be for joy and gladness and cheerful feasts to the house of Judah. Therefore, love truth and peace.

20. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: There shall yet come people, and the inhabitants of many cities.

21. And those living in one city shall go to another, saying, Let us proceed and go make supplication before Jehovah, and seek Jehovah of Hosts; I will go also.

22. And many people and strong nations shall come to seek Jehovah of Hosts in Jerusalem, and to make supplication before Jehovah.

23. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: In those days ten men out of all languages of the nations shall take hold and grasp the sleeve of a man who is a Jew, saying, Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.

## Zechariah 9

1. The burden of the Word of Jehovah against the land of Hadrach, and its resting place, Damascus, (when the eyes of man, and all the tribes of Israel are toward Jehovah),

2. and Hamath also borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise.

3. And Tyre shall build a fortress for herself, and shall pile up silver like the dust, and gold like the mud of the streets.

4. Behold, the Lord will dispossess her, and He will strike her power in the sea, and she shall be devoured with fire.

5. Ashkelon shall see and fear; Gaza also shall writhe in great pain; and Ekron, her expectation shall be dried up. And the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.

6. And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.

7. And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth. But the remnant, even he, shall be for our God. And he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.

8. And I will camp around My house because of the army, because of him who passes by and because of him who returns. And an oppressor shall not pass through them any more. For now I have seen with My eyes.

9. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your King comes to you! He is righteous and having salvation, lowly, and riding on an ass, even on a colt, the foal of an ass.

10. And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem. And the battle bow shall be cut off, and He shall speak peace to the nations. And His dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.

11. As for you, by the blood of your covenant I have set free your prisoners from the pit, where there is no water.

12. Turn to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope. Even today I declare that I will restore double to you.

13. For I have bent Judah for Me as a bow, filled it with Ephraim, and stirred up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece, and made you as the sword of a mighty man.

14. Then Jehovah will be seen over them, and His arrow shall go out as lightning; and the Lord Jehovah shall blow the shofar and shall go forth with the tempests of the south.

15. Jehovah of Hosts shall defend them. And they shall devour and subdue with slingstones. And they shall drink and roar, as with wine. And they shall be full like a bowl, like the corners of the altar.

16. And Jehovah their God shall save them in that day as the flock of His people; for they are as stones of a crown, lifted up as a sign over His land.

17. For how great is its goodness, and how great its beauty. Grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins.

## Zechariah 10

1. Ask rain from Jehovah in the time of the latter rain. Jehovah shall make lightnings. And He gives them showers of rain, to everyone grass in the field.

2. For the family idols speak iniquity, and the diviners have seen a lie and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain. Therefore they wandered like sheep. They were troubled because there was no shepherd.

3. My anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the rams. For Jehovah of Hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, and made them as His majestic horse in battle.

4. From Him came the cornerstone, from Him the nail, from Him the battle bow, and from Him every ruler together.

5. And they shall be like mighty ones who trample the mud of the streets in the battle. And they shall fight because Jehovah is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.

6. And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph. And I will return to save them, for I have mercy on them. And they shall be as though I had not cast them off, for I am Jehovah their God, and I will answer them.

7. And Ephraim shall be like a mighty one, and their heart shall be glad as by wine. And their sons shall see and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in Jehovah.

8. I will whistle for them and gather them, for I have redeemed them. And they shall multiply as they once multiplied.

9. And I will sow them among the peoples, and they shall remember Me in far countries, and they shall live with their sons and return.

10. And I will bring them back out of the land of Egypt and gather them out of Assyria. And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon, until no more room shall be found for them.

11. And He shall pass through the sea with distress and strike the waves of the sea, and all the depths of the river shall dry up. And the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the scepter of Egypt shall be removed.

12. And I will strengthen them in Jehovah, and they shall walk up and down in His name, says Jehovah.

## Zechariah 11

1. Open your doors, O Lebanon, so that the fire may devour your cedars.

2. Howl, fir tree, for the cedar has fallen, because the majestic are destroyed. Howl, O oaks of Bashan, for the inaccessible forest has come down.

3. A voice of the wailing of the shepherds; for their splendor is destroyed. A voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is destroyed.

4. For thus says Jehovah my God, Feed the flock for slaughter,

5. whose possessors kill them and are not held guilty. And those who sell them say, Blessed be Jehovah, for I am rich. And their shepherds do not pity them.

6. For I will no longer pity the inhabitants of the land, says Jehovah. But, lo, I will deliver every man found, each one into his neighbors hand, and into his kings hand. And they shall strike the land, and I will not deliver them out of their hand.

7. And I fed the flock of slaughter, the truly poor of the flock. And I took two staffs for Myself: the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bonds. And I fed the flock.

8. I also cut off three shepherds in one month. And My soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred Me.

9. Then I said, I will not feed you; that which dies, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off. And let the ones remaining, each woman, eat the flesh of her neighbor.

10. And I took My staff, Beauty, and chopped it in two, that I might break My covenant which I had made with all the peoples.

11. And it was broken in that day, and so the poor of the flock who were watching Me knew that it was the Word of Jehovah.

12. And I said to them, If it is good in your eyes, give Me My wages; and if not, refrain. And they weighed out My wages, thirty pieces of silver.

13. And Jehovah said to Me, Throw it to the potter, the magnificent price at which I was valued by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of Jehovah.

14. Then I chopped in two My second staff, Bonds, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.

15. And Jehovah said to Me, Take to yourself yet the vessels of a foolish shepherd.

16. For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land; he shall not visit those who are cut off, nor will he seek the young, nor heal that which is broken, nor will he nourish that which still stands. But he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear off their hooves.

17. Woe to the worthless shepherd who abandons the flock! The sword shall be against his arm and against his right eye. His arm shall be completely dried up, and his right eye shall be totally darkened.

## Zechariah 12

1. The burden of the Word of Jehovah for Israel, says Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him.

2. Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling to all the peoples all around, and it shall also be against Judah in the siege against Jerusalem.

3. And in that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it shall be slashed; cut to pieces. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it.

4. In that day I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness, says Jehovah. And I will open My eyes on the house of Judah, and will strike every horse of the people with blindness.

5. And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in Jehovah of Hosts, their God.

6. In that day I will make the governors of Judah like a hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire among cut grain. And they shall devour all the peoples all around, on the right hand and on the left. And Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, in Jerusalem.

7. Jehovah also shall save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not be magnified above Judah.

8. In that day Jehovah shall defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And he who is feeble among them in that day shall be like David, and the house of David shall be like God, like the Angel of Jehovah before them.

9. And it shall be in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.

10. And I will pour on the house of David, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and supplication. And they shall look on Me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they shall be bitter over Him, like the bitterness over the firstborn.

11. In that day the mourning in Jerusalem shall be great, like the mourning of Hadad-rimmon in the valley of Megiddo.

12. And the land shall mourn, each family alone: the family of the house of David alone, and their wives alone; the family of the house of Nathan alone, and their wives alone;

13. the family of the house of Levi alone, and their wives alone; the family of Shimei alone, and their wives alone;

14. all the families who remain, each family alone, and their wives alone.

## Zechariah 13

1. In that day a fountain shall be opened to the house of David and to those living in Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity.

2. And it shall be in that day, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no longer be remembered, says Jehovah of Hosts. And I will also cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.

3. And it shall be that when any shall continue to prophesy, then his father and his mother who begot him shall say to him, You shall not live, for you speak lies in the name of Jehovah. And his father and his mother who begot him shall thrust him through when he prophesies.

4. And it shall be in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed, each one of his vision when he prophesies, and they shall not wear a hairy garment to deceive.

5. But he shall say, I am not a prophet; I am a man who tills the ground, for a man taught me to engage in business from my youth.

6. And one shall say to Him, What are these wounds between Your hands? Then He shall answer, Those with which I was beaten in the house of those who love Me.

7. Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, and against the Man who is My Associate, says Jehovah of Hosts. Strike the Shepherd and the sheep will be scattered. And I will turn My hand on the little ones.

8. And it shall come to pass in all the land, says Jehovah, that two parts in it shall be cut off and perish, but the third shall be left in it.

9. And I will bring the third part through the fire, and I will refine them as silver is refined. And I will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on My name, and I will answer them. I will say, It is My people, and they shall say, Jehovah is my God.

## Zechariah 14

1. Behold, the day of Jehovah comes, and your spoils shall be divided in your midst.

2. For I will gather all the nations to battle against Jerusalem. And the city shall be captured, and the houses plundered, and the women ravished. And half the city shall go into captivity and the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city.

3. And Jehovah shall go forth and fight against those nations, like the day He fought in the day of battle.

4. And His feet shall stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives shall split in two, from the east even to the west, a very great valley. And half of the mountain shall move toward the north, and half of it toward the south.

5. And you shall flee to the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal. And you shall flee as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah. And Jehovah my God shall come, and all the saints with You.

6. And it will come to pass in that day, that there shall not be light; the great lights will shrink.

7. And it will be one day which shall be known to Jehovah; not day and not night, but it will happen, that there will be light at evening time.

8. And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea; in summer and in winter it shall be.

9. And Jehovah shall be King over all the earth. In that day there shall be one Jehovah, and His name one.

10. All the land shall be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. And it shall rise and dwell in its place, from Benjamins Gate to the place of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananeel to the kings winepresses.

11. And they shall live in it. And there shall never again be utter destruction, but Jerusalem shall dwell safely.

12. And this shall be the plague with which Jehovah will strike all the people who have fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh shall rot away while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot away in their sockets, and their tongues shall rot away in their mouths.

13. And it shall happen in that day, that a great confusion from Jehovah shall be among them; and they shall each one lay hold of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor.

14. And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem. And the wealth of the surrounding nations shall be gathered together; gold, and silver, and clothing, in great abundance.

15. And so shall be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, and the ass, and all the beasts which shall be in those camps, like this plague.

16. And it shall come to pass, that everyone who is left from all the nations which came up against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to bow down before the King, Jehovah of Hosts, and keep the Feast of Booths.

17. And it shall be, that whoever will not go up from the families of the earth to Jerusalem to bow down before the King, Jehovah of Hosts, even upon them there shall be no rain.

18. And if the family of Egypt does not go up, nor come in, then they shall have no rain; the same plague with which Jehovah shall strike the nations who do not come up to keep the Feast of Booths.

19. This shall be Egypts punishment, and the punishment of all nations who do not come up to keep the Feast of Booths.

20. In that day there shall be on the bells of the horses, HOLY TO JEHOVAH. And the pots in the house of Jehovah shall be like the bowls before the altar.

21. And every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holy to Jehovah of Hosts. And all those who sacrifice shall come and take of them, and boil in them. And in that day there shall not ever again be a merchant in the house of Jehovah of Hosts.
