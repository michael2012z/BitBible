# Malachi

## Malachi 1

1. The burden of the Word of Jehovah to Israel by the hand of Malachi.

2. I have loved you, says Jehovah. Yet you say, In what way have You loved us? Was not Esau the brother to Jacob? says Jehovah; yet I loved Jacob,

3. and I have hated Esau and have made his mountains and his inheritance a desolation for the jackals of the wilderness.

4. Whereas Edom says, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus says Jehovah of Hosts: They shall build, but I will tear down. And they shall call them the region of wickedness, and the people with whom Jehovah has indignation forever.

5. And your eyes shall see, and you shall say, Jehovah will be magnified beyond the border of Israel.

6. A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If then I am a father, where is My honor? And if I am a master, where is My fear? says Jehovah of Hosts to you, O priests who despise My name. But you say, In what way have we despised Your name?

7. You offer defiled food on My altar, and say, In what way have we defiled You? By saying, The table of Jehovah is to be held in contempt.

8. And if you offer the blind in sacrifice, is it not evil? And if you offer the lame and the sick, is it not evil? Bring it now to your governor. Will he be pleased with you or receive you favorably? says Jehovah of Hosts.

9. And now entreat the face of the Mighty God, that He may be gracious to us. This has been by your hands; will He receive you favorably? says Jehovah of Hosts.

10. Who is there even among you that will shut the doors, so that you not kindle fire on My altar in vain? I have no pleasure in you, says Jehovah of Hosts, nor will I accept a food offering from your hand.

11. For from the east to the west, My name shall be great among the nations, and everywhere incense shall be offered to My name; and a pure food offering; for My name shall be great among the nations, says Jehovah of Hosts.

12. But you profane it when you say, The table of the Lord is defiled; and its fruit, His food is to be held in contempt.

13. And you have said, Behold, what weariness. And you have sniffed at it, says Jehovah of Hosts. And you bring what was stolen, and the lame, and the sick; and you bring the grain offering. Should I accept it from your hand? says Jehovah.

14. But cursed be a deceiver when there is a male in his flock, he vows it, but sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished. For I am a great King, says Jehovah of Hosts, and My name is feared among the nations.

## Malachi 2

1. And now, O priests, this command is to you.

2. If you will not hear, and if you will not lay it to heart to give glory to My name, says Jehovah of Hosts, then I will send the curse on you, and I will curse your blessings. And indeed, I have cursed it, because you are not laying it to heart.

3. Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and I will spread dung on your faces, the dung of your solemn feasts; and one will take you away with it.

4. And you shall know that I have sent this command to you, to be My covenant with Levi, says Jehovah of Hosts.

5. My covenant with him was life and peace, and I gave them to him for fear; and he feared Me, and he was in awe before My name.

6. The Law of Truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found on his lips. In peace and in uprightness he walked with Me, and he turned many away from iniquity.

7. For the lips of the priest should keep knowledge, and they should seek the Law from his mouth; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of Hosts.

8. But you have turned aside out of the way; you have caused many to stumble at the Law. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says Jehovah of Hosts.

9. So I have also made you despised and low before all the people, just as you have not kept My ways, but have shown partiality in the Law.

10. Is there not one father to us all? Has not one Mighty God created us? Why do we act deceitfully each man with his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?

11. Judah has dealt treacherously, and has done an abomination in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Jehovah, which He loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.

12. Jehovah will cut off from the tents of Jacob the man who does this, waking and answering, or offering a grain offering to Jehovah of Hosts.

13. And this is a second thing you do: covering the altar of Jehovah with tears, with weeping and crying out; so that He does not regard the grain offering, nor receive it with delight from your hand.

14. Yet you say, For what reason? Because Jehovah has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously; and she is your companion and your wife by covenant.

15. And has He not made them one? Yet the remnant of the Spirit is in him. And why one? He was seeking a seed of God. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and do not deal treacherously with the wife of your youth.

16. For Jehovah the God of Israel, says that He hates divorce, and to cover violence with ones garment, says Jehovah of Hosts. Therefore take heed to your spirit and do not deal treacherously.

17. You have wearied Jehovah with your words. Yet you say, In what way have we wearied Him? When you say, Every evildoer is good in the eyes of Jehovah, and He delights in them; or, Where is the God of justice?

## Malachi 3

1. Behold, I send My messenger, and He will prepare the way before Me. And the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to His temple, even the Messenger of the Covenant, in whom you delight. Behold, He comes, says Jehovah of Hosts.

2. But who can endure the day of His coming? And who will stand when He appears? For He is like a refiners fire and like fullers soap.

3. And He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and He shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them like gold and like silver, that they may draw near to Jehovah with an offering in righteousness.

4. Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem shall be pleasing to Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in former years.

5. And I will come near to you for judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against those swearing to a lie; and against those who defraud the hired laborer of his pay, and turn away the widow, and the fatherless, and the alien; and who do not fear Me, says Jehovah of Hosts.

6. For I, Jehovah, change not. Therefore you sons of Jacob are not destroyed.

7. From the days of your fathers, you have turned aside from My statutes and have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you, says Jehovah of Hosts. But you say, In what way shall we return?

8. Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me. But you say, How have we robbed You? In the tithe and the offering.

9. You are cursed with a curse, for you have robbed Me, even this whole nation.

10. Bring all the tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food in My house, and test Me now with this, says Jehovah of Hosts, whether I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour out a blessing until there is not enough room to store it.

11. And I will rebuke the devourer for you, and he shall not destroy the fruit of your ground; nor shall your vine fail to bear fruit in the field, says Jehovah of Hosts.

12. And all nations shall call you blessed, for you shall be a delightful land, says Jehovah of Hosts.

13. Your words have been strong against Me, says Jehovah. Yet you say, What have we spoken against you?

14. You have said, It is vain to serve God. And, What profit is it that we have kept His charge, and that we have walked as mourners before Jehovah of Hosts?

15. And now we are calling the arrogant blessed. Those that work wickedness are built up; they even test God, and escape.

16. Then those who feared Jehovah spoke together, each man to his neighbor. And Jehovah gave attention and heard. And a Book of Remembrance was written before Him for those who feared Jehovah, and for those who thought on His name.

17. And they shall be Mine, says Jehovah of Hosts, for the day that I will make up My treasure. And I will pity them as a man has compassion on his son who serves him.

18. Then you shall again distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, between him who serves God and him who does not serve Him.

## Malachi 4

1. For, behold, the day is coming, burning like a fire pot; and all the proud and everyone that does wickedness shall be chaff. And the coming day will set them ablaze, says Jehovah of Hosts, which will not leave to them root or branch.

2. But to you who fear My name, the Sun of Righteousness shall rise up, with healing on His wings. And you shall go out and frisk like calves of the stall.

3. And you shall tread down the wicked, for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I do this, says Jehovah of Hosts.

4. Remember the Law of My servant Moses which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel, the statutes and judgments.

5. Behold, I am sending you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of Jehovah.

6. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the sons, and the heart of the sons to their fathers, that I not come and strike the earth with utter destruction.
