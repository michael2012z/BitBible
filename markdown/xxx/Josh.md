# Joshua

## Joshua 1

1. And after the death of Moses the servant of Jehovah, it came to pass that Jehovah spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses minister, saying:

2. Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, into the land which I am giving to them; to the children of Israel.

3. Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon I have given to you, as I have said to Moses.

4. From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river, the River Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your territory.

5. No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will not abandon you nor forsake you.

6. Be strong and of good courage, for to this people you shall divide as an inheritance the land which I have sworn to their fathers to give to them.

7. Only be strong and very courageous, that you may take heed to do according to all the Law which Moses My servant has commanded you; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go.

8. This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may take heed to do according to all that is written in it. For then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success.

9. Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go.

10. Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,

11. Pass through the camp and command the people, saying, Prepare provisions for yourselves, for within three days you are crossing over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving you to possess.

12. And to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua spoke, saying,

13. Remember the word which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God is giving you rest and has given you this land.

14. Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land which Moses has given you on this side of the Jordan. But you shall pass before your brethren armed, all your mighty men of valor, and help them,

15. until Jehovah has given your brethren rest, as He has given you, and they also have taken possession of the land which Jehovah your God is giving to them. Then you shall return to possess the land of your inheritance, which Moses the servant of Jehovah has given you on this side of the Jordan toward the sunrise.

16. So they answered Joshua, saying, All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.

17. Just as we have heeded Moses in all things, so we will heed you. Only Jehovah your God be with you, as He was with Moses.

18. Whoever rebels against your mouth and does not heed your words, in all that you command him, shall be put to death. Only be strong and of good courage.

## Joshua 2

1. And Joshua the son of Nun sent out two men from Shittim to spy secretly, saying, Go, view the land, especially Jericho. So they went, and came to the house of a harlot woman named Rahab, and lodged there.

2. And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, men have come here tonight from the children of Israel to search out the land.

3. And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered your house, for they have come to search out all the land.

4. And the woman took the two men and hid them; and she said, Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from.

5. And it happened as the gate was being shut, when it was dark, that the men departed. Where the men have gone I do not know; pursue them quickly, for you may overtake them.

6. (But she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.)

7. And the men pursued them by the road to the Jordan, to the fords. And as soon as those who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.

8. And before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof,

9. and said to the men: I know that Jehovah has given you the land, that the terror of you has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted before you.

10. For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were on the other side of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.

11. And as soon as we heard these things, our hearts melted; neither did there remain any more courage in anyone because of you, for Jehovah your God, He is God in the heavens above and on earth beneath.

12. Now therefore, I beg you, swear to me by Jehovah, since I have shown you kindness, that you also will show kindness to my fathers house, and give me a true token,

13. and save alive my father, my mother, my brothers, my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our souls from death.

14. And the men answered her, Our lives for yours, if you tell none of this business of ours. And it shall be, when Jehovah gives us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.

15. Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was on the side of the wall; she dwelt in the wall.

16. And she said to them, Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you. Hide there three days, until the pursuers return; and afterward you may go your way.

17. And the men said to her: We will be exempt from this oath of yours which you have made us swear,

18. unless, when we come into the land, you bind this cord of scarlet thread in the window through which you have let us down; and you shall bring your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your fathers household into your house.

19. And it shall be that whoever goes outside the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be upon his own head, and we will be guiltless. And whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head if a hand is laid on him.

20. And if you tell this business of ours, then we will be free from your oath which you have made us swear.

21. And she said, According to your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed. And she bound the scarlet cord in the window.

22. They departed and went into the mountain, and stayed there three days until the pursuers had returned. The pursuers sought them all along the way, but did not find them.

23. So the two men returned, descended from the mountain, and crossed over; and they came to Joshua the son of Nun, and recounted to him all that happened to them.

24. And they said to Joshua, Truly Jehovah has delivered all the land into our hands, for indeed all the inhabitants of the land have melted before us.

## Joshua 3

1. And Joshua arose early in the morning; and they set out from Shittim and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before crossing over.

2. So it was, after three days, that the officers went through the camp;

3. and they commanded the people, saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests, the Levites, bearing it, then you shall set out from your place and go after it.

4. Yet there shall be a distance between you and it of about two thousand cubits by measure. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you must go, for you have not passed this way before.

5. And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonders among you.

6. And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over before the people. So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.

7. And Jehovah said to Joshua, This day I will begin to magnify you in the eyes of all Israel, and they shall know that, as I was with Moses, so I am with you.

8. And you shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When you have come to the edge of the water of the Jordan, you shall remain standing in the Jordan.

9. And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come here, and hear the words of Jehovah your God.

10. And Joshua said, By this you shall know that the living Mighty God is among you, and that He will destroy to dispossess before you the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Hivites and the Perizzites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Jebusites:

11. Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing over before you into the Jordan.

12. Now therefore, take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from each tribe.

13. And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of Jehovah, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, the waters that come down from upstream, and they shall stand in a heap.

14. So it was, when the people set out from their tents to cross over the Jordan, with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people,

15. and as those who bore the ark came to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark dipped into the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks during the whole time of harvest),

16. that the waters which came down from upstream stood still, and rose in a heap very far away at Adam, the city that is beside Zaretan. Thus the waters that went down into the sea of the plain, the Salt Sea, stopped, and were cut off; and the people crossed over opposite Jericho.

17. And the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan; and all Israel crossed over on dry ground, until all the people had crossed completely over the Jordan.

## Joshua 4

1. And it came to pass, when all the people had completely crossed over the Jordan, that Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying:

2. Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe,

3. and command them, saying, Take for yourselves twelve stones from here, out of the midst of the Jordan, from the place where the priests feet stood firm. You shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you lodge tonight.

4. Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the children of Israel, one man from each tribe;

5. and Joshua said to them: Cross over before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of the Jordan, and each one of you take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel,

6. that this may be a sign among you when your children ask in time to come, saying, What are these stones to you?

7. Then you shall answer them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; when it crossed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. And these stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel for all time.

8. And the children of Israel did so, as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah had spoken to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel, and carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.

9. And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, at the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day.

10. Thus, the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that Jehovah had commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua; and the people hurried and crossed over.

11. And it came to pass, when all the people had completely crossed over, that the ark of Jehovah and the priests crossed over before the people.

12. And the men of Reuben, the men of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses had spoken to them.

13. About forty thousand prepared for war crossed over before Jehovah for battle, to the plains of Jericho.

14. On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the eyes of all Israel; and they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the days of his life.

15. And Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying,

16. Command the priests who bear the ark of the Testimony to come up out of the Jordan.

17. Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come up out of the Jordan.

18. And it came to pass, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah had come from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests feet touched the dry land, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed all its banks as before.

19. Now the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they camped in Gilgal on the east border of Jericho.

20. And the twelve stones which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal.

21. And he spoke to the children of Israel, saying: When your sons ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What are these stones?

22. then you shall let your children know, saying, Israel crossed over this Jordan on dry land;

23. for Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, as Jehovah your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed over,

24. that all the peoples of the earth might know the hand of Jehovah, that it is mighty, that you may fear Jehovah your God all your days.

## Joshua 5

1. So it was, when all the kings of the Amorites who were on the west side of the Jordan, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard that Jehovah had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the children of Israel until we had crossed over, that their heart melted; and there was no spirit in them any longer because of the children of Israel.

2. At that time Jehovah said to Joshua, Make flint knives for yourself, and circumcise the sons of Israel again the second time.

3. And Joshua made flint knives for himself, and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.

4. And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: All the people who came out of Egypt who were males, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the way, after they had come out of Egypt.

5. For all the people who came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness, on the way as they came out of Egypt, had not been circumcised.

6. For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people who were men of war, who had come out of Egypt, were consumed, because they did not obey the voice of Jehovah; to whom Jehovah swore that He would not show them the land which Jehovah had sworn to their fathers that He would give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey.

7. And Joshua circumcised their sons whom He raised up in their place; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.

8. So it was, when they had finished circumcising all the people, that they stayed in their places in the camp to be healed.

9. And Jehovah said to Joshua, This day I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you. Therefore the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.

10. And the children of Israel camped in Gilgal, and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening on the wilderness plains of Jericho.

11. And they ate of the produce of the land on the day after the Passover, unleavened bread and roasted grain, on the very same day.

12. And the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten the produce of the land; and the children of Israel no longer had manna, but they ate the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.

13. And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a Man stood opposite him with His sword drawn in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, Are You for us or for our adversaries?

14. And He said, No, but as Commander of the army of Jehovah I have now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and prostrated himself, and said to Him, What does my Lord speak to His servant?

15. And the Commander of the army of Jehovah said to Joshua, Take your sandal off your foot, for the place where you are standing is holy. And Joshua did so.

## Joshua 6

1. Now Jericho was closed, shut up before the children of Israel; no one going out, and no one coming in.

2. And Jehovah said to Joshua: Behold, I have given Jericho into your hand, its king, and the mighty men of valor.

3. You shall go around the city, all the men of war; you shall go all around the city once. Thus you shall do six days.

4. And seven priests shall bear seven shofars of rams horns before the ark. And the seventh day you shall go around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the shofars.

5. And it shall come to pass, when they make a long blast with the rams horn, and when you hear the sound of the shofar, that all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat. And the people shall go up every man straight before him.

6. And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven shofars of rams horns before the ark of Jehovah.

7. And he said to the people, Pass along, and go around the city, and let him who is armed go along before the ark of Jehovah.

8. So it was, when Joshua spoke to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven shofars of rams horns before Jehovah went along and blew the shofars, with the ark of the covenant of Jehovah following behind.

9. The armed men went before the priests who blew the shofars, with the rear guard coming along behind the ark, while they proceeded blowing the shofars.

10. And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, You shall not shout or cause your voice to be heard, nor shall a word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I say to you, Shout! Then you shall shout.

11. So the ark of Jehovah went around the city, going around it once. And they came into the camp and lodged in the camp.

12. And Joshua arose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Jehovah.

13. And seven priests bearing seven shofars of rams horns before the ark of Jehovah proceeded to walk and blew with the shofars. And the armed men went before them, the rear guard coming behind the ark of Jehovah, while they proceeded blowing the shofars.

14. And the second day they went around the city once and returned to the camp. Thus they did six days.

15. But it came to pass on the seventh day that they arose early, about the dawning of the day, and went around the city seven times in the same manner. Only, on that day they went around the city seven times.

16. And the seventh time it happened, when the priests had blown the shofars, that Joshua said to the people: Shout! For Jehovah has given you the city!

17. And the city shall be devoted unto Jehovah, it and all who are in it. Only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we had sent.

18. And you shall altogether keep from the devoted things, that you not be accursed when you take of the devoted things, and make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.

19. And all the silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are holy unto Jehovah; they shall come into the treasury of Jehovah.

20. So the people shouted when the priests blew the shofars. And it happened, when the people heard the sound of the shofars and the people shouting with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat. And the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they captured the city.

21. And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword.

22. And Joshua had said to the two men who had spied out the land, Go into the harlots house, and from there bring out the woman and all that she has, as you have sworn to her.

23. And the young men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had. And they brought out all her family and set them outside the camp of Israel.

24. And they burned the city and all that was in it with fire. Only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah.

25. And Joshua saved alive Rahab the harlot, her fathers house, and all that she had. And she dwells in Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho.

26. And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Jehovah who rises up and builds this city Jericho; he shall lay its foundation with his firstborn, and with his youngest he shall set up its gates.

27. Thus Jehovah was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout all the land.

## Joshua 7

1. But the children of Israel committed a trespass regarding the devoted things, for Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted things; so the anger of Jehovah burned against the children of Israel.

2. Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is next to Beth Aven, to the east of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai.

3. And they returned to Joshua and said to him, Do not let all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai. Do not make all the people toil there, for they are few.

4. So about three thousand men went up there from the people, but they fled before the men of Ai.

5. And the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six men, for they chased them from before the gate as far as Shebarim, and struck them down on the descent. And the hearts of the people melted and became like water.

6. And Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of Jehovah until evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they threw dust on their heads.

7. And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah, why have You brought this people over the Jordan at all; to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? Oh, that we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan!

8. O Lord, what shall I say when Israel turns its back before its enemies?

9. For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear it, and surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. Then what will You do for Your great name?

10. And Jehovah said to Joshua: Get up! Why do you lie thus on your face?

11. Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I have commanded them. For they have even taken some of the devoted things, and have both stolen and deceived; and they have also put it among their own stuff.

12. Therefore the sons of Israel were not able to stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they are accursed. Neither will I be with you anymore, unless you destroy the accursed from among you.

13. Get up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, because thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: There is a devoted thing in your midst, O Israel; you are not able to stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted thing from among you.

14. In the morning therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes. And it shall be that the tribe which Jehovah takes shall come according to families; and the family which Jehovah takes shall come by households; and the household which Jehovah takes shall come man by man.

15. And it shall be that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and because he has done a disgraceful thing in Israel.

16. So Joshua arose early in the morning and brought Israel near by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken.

17. He brought near the family of Judah, and he took the family of the Zarhites; and he brought near the family of the Zarhites man by man, and Zabdi was taken.

18. And he brought near his house man by man, and Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.

19. And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give glory to Jehovah the God of Israel, and make confession to Him, and please tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me.

20. And Achan answered Joshua and said, Indeed I have sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel, and this is what I have done:

21. When I saw among the spoils a beautiful garment from Shinar, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. And behold, they are hidden in the earth in the midst of my tent, with the silver under it.

22. So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was hidden in his tent, with the silver under it.

23. And they took them from the midst of the tent, brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before Jehovah.

24. And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the garment, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that he had, and they brought them to the valley of Achor.

25. And Joshua said, Why have you troubled us? Jehovah shall trouble you this day! And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones.

26. And they raised over him a great heap of stones, still there to this day. And Jehovah turned back from His burning anger. Therefore the name of that place has been called the Valley of Achor to this day.

## Joshua 8

1. And Jehovah said to Joshua: Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed; take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up to Ai. Behold, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land.

2. And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king. Only its spoils and its cattle you shall take as plunder for yourselves. Lay an ambush for the city behind it.

3. So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai; and Joshua chose thirty thousand mighty men of valor and sent them away by night.

4. And he commanded them, saying: Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you be ready.

5. And I and all the people with me shall approach the city; and it shall come about, when they come out against us as at the first, that we shall flee before them.

6. For they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city, for they will think, They are fleeing before us as at the first. Therefore we will flee before them.

7. Then you shall rise up from the ambush and seize the city, for Jehovah your God has delivered it into your hand.

8. And it shall be, when you have taken the city, that you shall set the city on fire. According to the word of Jehovah you shall do. See, I have commanded you.

9. Joshua therefore sent them out; and they went to lie in ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; and Joshua lodged that night among the people.

10. And Joshua rose up early in the morning and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.

11. And all the people of war who were with him went up and drew near; and they came before the city and camped on the north side of Ai. Now a valley lay between them and Ai.

12. So he took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.

13. And when they had set the people, all the army that was on the north of the city, and its rear guard on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.

14. And it happened, when the king of Ai saw it, that the men of the city hurried and arose early and went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at an appointed place before the plain. But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.

15. And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by way of the wilderness.

16. So all the people of Ai were assembled to pursue them. And they pursued Joshua and were drawn away from the city.

17. There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who had not gone out after Israel. So they left the city open and pursued Israel.

18. And Jehovah said to Joshua, Stretch out the javelin in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin in his hand toward the city.

19. And those in ambush rose up quickly out of their place; they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and they entered the city and took it, and hurried to set the city on fire.

20. And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended to the heavens. So they had no strength to flee this way or that way, and the people who had fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.

21. And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city ascended, they turned back and struck down the men of Ai.

22. And the others came out of the city against them; so they were caught in the midst of Israel, some on this side and some on that side. And they struck them down, so that they let none of them remain or escape.

23. And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.

24. And it came to pass when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness where they pursued them, and when they all had fallen by the edge of the sword until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword.

25. And all who fell that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand; all the people of Ai.

26. For Joshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.

27. Only the livestock and the spoils of that city Israel took as plunder for themselves, according to the word of Jehovah which He had commanded Joshua.

28. And Joshua burned Ai and made it a perpetual heap, a desolation to this day.

29. And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening. And as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded and they took his corpse down from the tree, cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raise over it a great heap of stones that remains to this day.

30. And Joshua built an altar unto Jehovah the God of Israel, in Mount Ebal,

31. as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses: an altar of whole stones on which no man has wielded an iron tool. And they offered upon it burnt offerings unto Jehovah, and sacrificed peace offerings.

32. And there, in the presence of the children of Israel, he wrote on the stones a copy of the Law of Moses, which he had written.

33. And all Israel, with their elders and officers and judges, stood on either side of the ark before the priests, the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, the sojourner as well as he who was born among them. Half of them were in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.

34. And afterward he read all the Words of the Law, the blessings and the curses, according to all that is written in the Book of the Law.

35. There was not a Word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, with the women, the little ones, and the sojourners who were living among them.

## Joshua 9

1. And it came to pass when all the kings who were by the Jordan, in the hills and in the lowland and in all the coasts of the Great Sea toward Lebanon; the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; heard about it,

2. that they gathered together to fight with Joshua and Israel with one mouth.

3. But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,

4. they did shrewdly, and went and pretended to be ambassadors. And they took old sacks on their donkeys, old wineskins torn and bound up,

5. old and patched sandals on their feet, and old garments on themselves; and all the bread of their provision was dry and in crumbs.

6. And they went to Joshua, to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, We have come from a distant land; now therefore, make a treaty with us.

7. And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, Perhaps you are dwelling among us; so how can we make a treaty with you?

8. But they said to Joshua, We are your servants. And Joshua said to them, Who are you, and where do you come from?

9. So they said to him: Your servants have come from a very distant land, because of the name of Jehovah your God; for we have heard of His fame, and all that He has done in Egypt,

10. and all that He has done to the two kings of the Amorites beyond the Jordan; to Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.

11. Therefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our land spoke to us, saying, Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, We are your servants; now therefore, make a treaty with us.

12. This bread of ours we took hot for our provision from our houses on the day we departed to come to you. But now behold, it is dry and crumbly.

13. And these wineskins which we filled were new, and behold, they are torn; and these our garments and our sandals have become old because of the very long journey.

14. And the men of Israel took some of their provisions; but they did not ask at the mouth of Jehovah.

15. And Joshua made peace with them, and made a treaty with them to let them live; and the leaders of the congregation swore to them.

16. And it happened at the end of three days, after they had made the treaty with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, dwelling among them.

17. And the children of Israel journeyed and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kirjath Jearim.

18. But the sons of Israel did not strike them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by Jehovah the God of Israel. And all the congregation grumbled against the leaders.

19. Then all the leaders said to all the congregation, We have sworn to them by Jehovah the God of Israel; now therefore, we cannot touch them.

20. This we will do to them: We will let them live, that wrath not be upon us because of the oath which we have sworn to them.

21. And the leaders said to them, Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the leaders have spoken to them.

22. And Joshua summoned them, and he spoke to them, saying, Why have you deceived us, saying, We are very far from you, when you are dwelling among us?

23. Now therefore, you are cursed, and none of you shall fail to be slaves, woodcutters and drawers of water for the house of my God.

24. And they answered Joshua and said, Because it was reported and told to your servants that Jehovah your God had commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you; therefore we were greatly afraid for our souls because of you, and have done this thing.

25. And now behold, we are in your hands; do with us as seems good and right in your eyes to do.

26. Thus he did to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the sons of Israel, so that they did not kill them.

27. And that day Joshua made them woodcutters and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of Jehovah, in the place which He would choose, even to this day.

## Joshua 10

1. Now it came to pass when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he had done to Ai and its king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them,

2. that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.

3. Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, saying,

4. Come up to me and help me, that we may strike Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.

5. Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered together and went up, they and all their armies, and camped before Gibeon and made war against it.

6. And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, saying, Do not forsake your servants; come up to us quickly, save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the mountains have gathered together against us.

7. So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.

8. And Jehovah said to Joshua, Do not fear them, for I have delivered them into your hand; not a man of them shall stand before you.

9. Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly, having marched all night from Gilgal.

10. And Jehovah routed them before Israel, struck them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, pursued them along the way that goes to Beth Horon, and struck them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah.

11. And it happened, as they fled before Israel and were on the descent of Beth Horon, that Jehovah cast down large hailstones from the heavens upon them as far as Azekah, and they died. There were more who died from the hailstones than the sons of Israel had killed with the sword.

12. Then Joshua spoke to Jehovah in the day when Jehovah delivered up the Amorites before the sons of Israel, and he said in the eyes of Israel: Sun, stand still over Gibeon; and Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.

13. And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the people took vengeance upon their enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of the heavens, and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day.

14. And there has been no day like that, before it or after it, that Jehovah heeded the voice of a man; for Jehovah fought for Israel.

15. And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.

16. But these five kings had fled and hidden themselves in a cave at Makkedah.

17. And it was reported to Joshua, saying, The five kings have been found hidden in a cave at Makkedah.

18. And Joshua said, Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them.

19. And do not stay there yourselves, but pursue your enemies, and strike their rear guard. Do not allow them to enter their cities, for Jehovah your God has delivered them into your hand.

20. And it happened, while Joshua and the sons of Israel made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they had finished, that those who had escaped entered fortified cities.

21. And all the people returned to the camp, to Joshua at Makkedah, in peace. No one moved his tongue against any of the sons of Israel.

22. And Joshua said, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings to me from the cave.

23. And they did so, and brought out those five kings to him from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.

24. And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua summoned all the men of Israel, and said to the commanders of the men of war who had gone with him, Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings. And they drew near and put their feet on their necks.

25. And Joshua said to them, Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage, for thus Jehovah will do to all your enemies against whom you fight.

26. And afterward Joshua struck them and killed them, and hung them on five trees; and they were hanging on the trees until evening.

27. And so at the time of the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, cast them into the cave where they had been hidden, and laid large stones against the caves mouth, which remain until this very day.

28. On that day Joshua took Makkedah, and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed them; all the souls who were in it. He let none remain. He also did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.

29. And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah; and they fought against Libnah.

30. And Jehovah also delivered it and its king into the hand of Israel; he struck it and all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword. He let none remain in it, but did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.

31. And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish; and they encamped against it and fought against it.

32. And Jehovah delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, who took it on the second day, and struck it and all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword, according to all that he had done to Libnah.

33. Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he left him none remaining.

34. From Lachish Joshua passed to Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it and fought against it.

35. They took it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword; all the souls who were in it he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.

36. And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it.

37. And they took it and struck it with the edge of the sword; its king, all its cities, and all the souls who were in it; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon, but utterly destroyed it and all the souls who were in it.

38. And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and they fought against it.

39. And he took it and its king and all its cities; they struck them with the edge of the sword and utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it. He left none remaining; as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir and its king, as he had done also to Libnah and its king.

40. Thus Joshua conquered all the lands of the mountains, and the south and the lowland and the wilderness slopes, and all their kings; he left no one remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Jehovah the God of Israel had commanded.

41. And Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea as far as Gaza, and all the land of Goshen, even as far as Gibeon.

42. All these kings and their land Joshua took at one time, because Jehovah the God of Israel, fought for Israel.

43. And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.

## Joshua 11

1. And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor heard these things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, to the king of Achshaph,

2. and to the kings who were from the north, in the mountains, in the plain south of Chinnereth, in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,

3. to the Canaanites in the east and in the west, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite in the mountains, and the Hivite below Hermon in the land of Mizpah.

4. And they went out, they and all their armies with them, as many people as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude, with very many horses and chariots.

5. And when all these kings had met together, they came and camped together at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel.

6. And Jehovah said to Joshua, Do not be afraid before them, for tomorrow about this time I will deliver all of them slain before Israel. You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.

7. So Joshua and all the people of war with him came against them suddenly by the waters of Merom, and fell upon them.

8. And Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Israel, who struck them and pursued them to Greater Sidon, to the Brook Misrephoth, and to the Valley of Mizpah eastward; they struck them until they left none of them remaining.

9. And Joshua did to them as Jehovah had spoken to him: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.

10. And Joshua turned back at that time and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword; for Hazor was formerly the head of all those kingdoms.

11. And they struck all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them. There was no one left breathing; and he burned Hazor with fire.

12. Thus all the cities of those kings, and all their kings, Joshua took and struck with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded.

13. But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, except Hazor only, which Joshua burned.

14. And all the spoils of these cities and the livestock, the sons of Israel took as plunder for themselves; but they struck every man with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them, and they left no one breathing.

15. As Jehovah had commanded Moses his servant, thus Moses had commanded Joshua, and thus Joshua did. He did not turn aside from anything of all that Jehovah had commanded Moses.

16. Thus Joshua took all this land: the mountains, all the south, all the land of Goshen, the lowland, and the plain; the mountains of Israel and its lowlands,

17. from Mount Halak and the ascent to Seir, even as far as Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings, and struck them down and killed them.

18. Joshua made war many days with all those kings.

19. There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. All the others they took in battle.

20. For it was of Jehovah to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that He might utterly destroy them, and that they might receive no mercy, but that He might destroy them, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.

21. And at that time Joshua came and cut off the Anakim from the mountains: from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel; Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.

22. None of the Anakim were left in the land of the children of Israel; they remained only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod.

23. Thus Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Jehovah had spoken to Moses; and Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.

## Joshua 12

1. These are the kings of the land whom the sons of Israel struck, and whose land they dispossessed on the other side of the Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the River Arnon to Mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east:

2. Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon and ruled half of Gilead, from Aroer, on the bank of the River Arnon, from the middle of that river, even as far as the River Jabbok, the border of the Ammonites,

3. and the eastern plain from the Sea of Chinnereth as far as the sea of the plain (the Salt Sea), the way to Beth Jeshimoth, and southward below the slopes of Pisgah.

4. And Og, king of Bashan, and his territory, of the remnant of the giants, who dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,

5. and reigned in Mount Hermon, over Salcah, over all Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half of Gilead to the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.

6. These Moses the servant of Jehovah and the sons of Israel had struck; and Moses the servant of Jehovah gave it as a possession to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.

7. And these are the kings of the land which Joshua and the sons of Israel conquered on this side of the Jordan, on the west, from Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon as far as Mount Halak and the ascent to Seir, which Joshua gave to the tribes of Israel as a possession according to their divisions,

8. in the mountains, in the lowlands, in the plains, in the slopes, in the wilderness, and in the south; the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:

9. the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;

10. the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;

11. the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;

12. the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;

13. the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;

14. the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;

15. the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;

16. the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;

17. the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;

18. the king of Aphek, one; the king of Sharon, one;

19. the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;

20. the king of Shimron Meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;

21. the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;

22. the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;

23. the king of Dor in the heights of Dor, one; the king of the nation of Gilgal, one;

24. the king of Tirzah, one. All the kings, thirty-one.

## Joshua 13

1. Now Joshua was old, advanced in years. And Jehovah said to him: You are old, advanced in years, and there remains very much land yet to be possessed.

2. This is the land that yet remains: all the territory of the Philistines and all Geshuri,

3. from Sihor, before Egypt, to the border of Ekron northward (which is counted as Canaanite); the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites;

4. from the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians as far as Aphek, to the border of the Amorites;

5. the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise, from Baal Gad below Mount Hermon as far as the entrance to Hamath;

6. all the inhabitants of the mountains from Lebanon as far as Misrephoth Maim, and all the Sidonians; them I will dispossess before the sons of Israel; only, divide it by lot to Israel as an inheritance, as I have commanded you.

7. Now therefore, divide this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.

8. With them the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses has given them, beyond the Jordan eastward, as Moses the servant of Jehovah has given them:

9. from Aroer on the bank of the River Arnon, and the town that is in the midst of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba as far as Dibon;

10. all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the border of the children of Ammon;

11. Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan as far as Salcah;

12. all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants; for Moses had struck and dispossessed them.

13. Nevertheless the sons of Israel did not dispossess the Geshurites or the Maachathites, but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell in the midst of Israel to this day.

14. Only to the tribe of Levi he had given no inheritance; the sacrifices by fire unto Jehovah the God of Israel, are their inheritance, as He had spoken to them.

15. And Moses had given to the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their families.

16. Their territory was from Aroer, the bank of the River Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;

17. Heshbon and all its cities in the plain: Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon,

18. Jahaza, Kedemoth, Mephaath,

19. Kirjathaim, Sibmah, Zereth Shahar on the mountain of the valley,

20. Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth;

21. all the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses had struck with the commanders of Midian: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, who were princes of Sihon dwelling in the land.

22. The sons of Israel also killed with the sword Balaam the son of Beor, the diviner, among their slain.

23. And the border of the sons of Reuben was the border of the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the sons of Reuben according to their families, the cities and their villages.

24. Moses also gave to the tribe of Gad, to the sons of Gad according to their families.

25. Their territory was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the Ammonites as far as Aroer, which is before Rabbah,

26. and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpah and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir,

27. and in the valley Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, with the Jordan as its border, as far as the edge of the Sea of Chinnereth, on the other side of the Jordan eastward.

28. This is the inheritance of the sons of Gad according to their families, the cities and their villages.

29. Moses also gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh; it was for the half-tribe of the sons of Manasseh according to their families:

30. Their territory was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair which are in Bashan, sixty cities;

31. half of Gilead, and Ashtaroth and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh, for half of the sons of Machir according to their families.

32. These are what Moses had distributed as an inheritance in the plains of Moab on the other side of the Jordan, from Jericho eastward.

33. But to the tribe of Levi Moses had given no inheritance; Jehovah the God of Israel, was their inheritance, as He had spoken to them.

## Joshua 14

1. These are what the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel divided up as possessions.

2. Their inheritance was by lot, as Jehovah had commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe.

3. For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe on the other side of the Jordan; but to the Levites he had given no inheritance among them.

4. For the sons of Joseph were two tribes: Manasseh and Ephraim. And they gave no portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to dwell in, with their common lands for their livestock and their property.

5. As Jehovah had commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did; and they divided the land.

6. Then the sons of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal. And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him: You know the word which Jehovah had spoken to Moses the man of God concerning you and me in Kadesh Barnea.

7. I was forty years old when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land, and I brought back word to him as it was in my heart.

8. Nevertheless my brethren who went up with me made the heart of the people melt, but I wholly followed Jehovah my God.

9. And Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land where your foot has trodden shall be your inheritance and of your sons perpetually, because you have fully followed Jehovah my God.

10. And now, behold, Jehovah has kept me alive, as He said, these forty-five years, ever since Jehovah spoke this word to Moses while Israel wandered in the wilderness; and now, here I am this day, eighty-five years old.

11. As yet I am as strong this day as on the day that Moses sent me; just as my strength was then, so now is my strength for war, both to go out and to come in.

12. Now therefore, give me this mountain of which Jehovah spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there, and that the cities were great and fortified. It may be that Jehovah will be with me, and I shall be able to drive them out as Jehovah has spoken.

13. And Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as an inheritance.

14. Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he fully followed Jehovah the God of Israel.

15. And the name of Hebron formerly was Kirjath Arba (Arba was a great man among the Anakim). And the land had rest from war.

## Joshua 15

1. This, then, was the lot of the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families: The border of Edom at the Wilderness of Zin southward was the southern extremity.

2. And their southern border began at the shore of the Salt Sea, from the bay that faces southward.

3. Then it went out to the southern side of the ascent of Akrabbim, passed along to Zin, ascended on the south side of Kadesh Barnea, passed along to Hezron, went up to Adar, and went around to Karkaa.

4. From there it passed toward Azmon and went out to the Brook of Egypt; and the border ended at the sea. This shall be your southern border.

5. The east border was the Salt Sea as far as the end of the Jordan. And the border on the northern edge began at the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan.

6. The border went up to Beth Hoglah and passed north of Beth Arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.

7. And the border went up toward Debir from the Valley of Achor, and it turned northward toward Gilgal, which is in front of the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the valley. The border continued toward the waters of En Shemesh and ended at En Rogel.

8. And the border went up by the valley of the Son of Hinnom to the southern slope of the Jebusites (which is Jerusalem). The border went up to the top of the mountain before the Valley of Hinnom westward, at the end of the Valley of Rephaim northward.

9. And the border went around from the top of the hill to the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and extended to the cities of Mount Ephron. And the border went around to Baalah (which is Kirjath Jearim).

10. And the border turned westward from Baalah to Mount Seir, passed along to the side of Mount Jearim on the north (which is Chesalon), went down to Beth Shemesh, and passed on to Timnah.

11. And the border went out to the side of Ekron northward. And the border went around to Shikkeron, passed along to Mount Baalah, and extended to Jabneel; and the border ended at the sea.

12. The west border was the Great Sea. This is the border of the sons of Judah all around according to their families.

13. And to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a share among the sons of Judah, according to the commandment of Jehovah to Joshua, namely, Kirjath Arba, which is Hebron (Arba was the father of Anak).

14. Caleb dispossessed the three sons of Anak from there: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, born to Anak.

15. And he went up from there to the inhabitants of Debir (formerly the name of Debir was Kirjath Sepher).

16. And Caleb said, He who strikes Kirjath Sepher and takes it, to him I will give Achsah my daughter as wife.

17. And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.

18. And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, What do you wish?

19. She answered, Give me a blessing; since you have given me land in the south, give me also springs of water. So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.

20. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families:

21. The cities at the extremities of the tribe of the sons of Judah, toward the border of Edom in the south, were Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur,

22. Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,

23. Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan,

24. Ziph, Telem, Bealoth,

25. Hazor, Hadattah, Kerioth, Hezron (which is Hazor),

26. Amam, Shema, Moladah,

27. Hazar Gaddah, Heshmon, Beth Pelet,

28. Hazar Shual, Beer-sheba, Bizjothjah,

29. Baalah, Ijim, Ezem,

30. Eltolad, Chesil, Hormah,

31. Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah,

32. Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are twenty-nine, with their villages.

33. In the lowland: Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah,

34. Zanoah, En Gannim, Tappuah, Enam,

35. Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah,

36. Sharaim, Adithaim, Gederah, and Gederothaim: fourteen cities with their villages;

37. Zenan, Hadashah, Migdal Gad,

38. Dilean, Mizpah, Joktheel,

39. Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon,

40. Cabbon, Lahmas, Kithlish,

41. Gederoth, Beth Dagon, Naamah, and Makkedah: sixteen cities with their villages;

42. Libnah, Ether, Ashan,

43. Jiphtah, Ashnah, Nezib,

44. Keilah, Achzib, and Mareshah: nine cities with their villages;

45. Ekron, with its daughter-villages;

46. from Ekron to the sea, all that lay near Ashdod, with their villages;

47. Ashdod with its daughter-villages, Gaza with its daughter-villages; as far as the Brook of Egypt and the Great Sea with its coastline.

48. And in the mountains: Shamir, Jattir, Sochoh,

50. Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim,

51. Goshen, Holon, and Giloh: eleven cities with their villages;

52. Arab, Dumah, Eshean,

61. In the wilderness: Beth Arabah, Middin, Secacah,

62. Nibshan, the City of Salt, and En Gedi: six cities with their villages.

63. As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the sons of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.

## Joshua 16

1. The lot of the sons of Joseph went from the Jordan, by Jericho, to the waters of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goes up from Jericho through the mountains to Bethel,

2. and went out from Bethel to Luz, passed along to the border of the Archites at Ataroth,

3. and went down westward to the border of the Japhletites, as far as the border of Lower Beth Horon to Gezer; and it ended at the sea.

4. Thus the sons of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took possession.

5. The border of the sons of Ephraim, according to their families: The border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth Addar as far as Upper Beth Horon.

6. And the border went out toward the sea on the north side of Michmethath; then the border went around eastward to Taanath Shiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah.

7. And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth and Naarah, reached to Jericho, and came out at the Jordan.

8. The border went out from Tappuah westward to the Brook Kanah, and it ended at the sea. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim according to their families.

9. And the separate cities of the sons of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.

10. And they did not drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim to this day and are serving under tribute.

## Joshua 17

1. There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph: for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war; therefore he was given Gilead and Bashan.

2. And there was a lot for the rest of the sons of Manasseh according to their families: for the sons of Abiezer, the sons of Helek, the sons of Asriel, the sons of Shechem, the sons of Hepher, and the sons of Shemida; these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.

3. But Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters. And these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

4. And they came near before Eleazar the priest, before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the leaders, saying, Jehovah had commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers. Therefore, according to the mouth of Jehovah, he gave them an inheritance among their fathers brothers.

5. Ten portions fell to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side of the Jordan,

6. because the daughters of Manasseh had inherited an inheritance among his sons; and the rest of Manassehs sons had the land of Gilead.

7. And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, that lies before Shechem; and the border went along south to the inhabitants of En Tappuah.

8. Manasseh had the land of Tappuah, but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the sons of Ephraim.

9. And the border descended to the Brook Kanah, southward to the brook. These cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh. The border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook; and it ended at the sea.

10. Southward it was Ephraims, northward it was Manassehs, and the sea was its border. It met up with Asher on the north and Issachar on the east.

11. And in Issachar and in Asher, Manasseh had Beth Shean and its daughter-villages, Ibleam and its daughter-villages, the inhabitants of Dor and its daughter-villages, the inhabitants of En Dor and its daughter-villages, the inhabitants of Taanach and its daughter-villages, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its daughter-villages; three high regions.

12. Yet the sons of Manasseh could not dispossess those cities, but the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land.

13. And it happened, when the sons of Israel grew strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not drive them out to dispossess them.

14. And the sons of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why have you given us only one lot and one portion to inherit, since we are a numerous people, inasmuch as Jehovah has blessed us until now?

15. And Joshua answered them, If you are a numerous people, then go up to the forests and clear out a place for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and the giants, since the mountains of Ephraim are too confined for you.

16. And the sons of Joseph said, The mountains are not enough for us; and all the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both those who are of Beth Shean and its daughter-villages and those who are of the Valley of Jezreel.

17. And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, saying, You are a numerous people and have great power, you shall not have only one lot,

18. but the mountains shall be yours. Although it is a forest, you shall cut it down, and it shall be yours to its extremities; for you shall dispossess the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots and are strong.

## Joshua 18

1. And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there. And the land was subdued before them.

2. But there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes which had not yet received their inheritance.

3. And Joshua said to the children of Israel: How long will you be slack to go and possess the land which Jehovah the God of your fathers has given to you?

4. Provide from among you three men for each tribe, and I will send them; they shall rise up and go through the land, plot it out according to their inheritance, and come back to me.

5. And they shall divide it into seven parts. Judah shall remain in their territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall remain in their territory on the north.

6. You shall therefore plot out the land into seven parts and bring the map here to me, and I shall cast lots for you here before Jehovah our God.

7. But the Levites have no portion among you, for the priesthood of Jehovah is their inheritance. And Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan to the east, which Moses the servant of Jehovah has given to them.

8. And the men arose to go away; and Joshua charged those who went to plot out the land, saying, Go, walk through the land, survey it, and come back to me, and I shall cast lots for you here before Jehovah at Shiloh.

9. So the men went, passed through the land, and plotted it out in a book into seven territories by cities; and they came to Joshua at the camp at Shiloh.

10. And Joshua cast lots for them at Shiloh before Jehovah, and there Joshua distributed the land to the sons of Israel according to their divisions.

11. And the lot of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the territory of their lot came out between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph.

12. Their border on the north side began at the Jordan, and the border went up alongside Jericho on the north, and went up through the mountains westward; it ended at the wilderness of Beth Aven.

13. The border went over from there toward Luz, beside Luz (which is Bethel) southward; and the border descended to Ataroth Addar, near the hill that is on the south side of Lower Beth Horon.

14. And the border extended around the west side to the south, from the hill that lies before Beth Horon southward; and it ended at Kirjath Baal (which is Kirjath Jearim), a city of the sons of Judah. This was the west side.

15. The south side began at the end of Kirjath Jearim, and the border extended on the west and went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.

16. And the border came down to the end of the mountain that is before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the valley of the giants on the north, descended to the Valley of Hinnom, beside the city of the Jebusites on the south, and descended to En Rogel.

17. And it went around from the north, went out to En Shemesh, and extended toward Geliloth, before the ascent of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.

18. Then it passed along toward the north side of the plains, and went down to the plains.

19. And the border passed along to the north side of Beth Hoglah; and the border ended at the north bay at the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This was the southern border.

20. The Jordan was its border on the east side. This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, according to its borders all around, according to their families.

21. And the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin, according to their families, were Jericho, Beth Hoglah, the valley of Keziz,

22. Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,

23. Avim, Parah, Ophrah,

24. Chephar Haammoni, Ophni, and Gaba: twelve cities with their villages;

25. Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth,

26. Mizpah, Chephirah, Mozah,

27. Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah,

28. Zelah, Eleph, Jebus (which is Jerusalem), Gibeath, and Kirjath: fourteen cities with their villages. This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin according to their families.

## Joshua 19

1. The second lot came out for Simeon, for the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families. And their inheritance was within the inheritance of the sons of Judah.

2. They had in their inheritance Beer-sheba (Sheba), Moladah,

3. Hazar Shual, Balah, Ezem,

4. Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah,

5. Ziklag, Beth Marcaboth, Hazar Susah,

6. Beth Lebaoth, and Sharuhen: thirteen cities and their villages;

7. Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan: four cities and their villages;

8. and all the villages that were all around these cities as far as Baalath Beer, Ramah of the south. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families.

9. The inheritance of the sons of Simeon was included in the portion of the sons of Judah, for the portion of the sons of Judah was too much for them. Therefore the sons of Simeon had their inheritance within their inheritance.

10. The third lot came out for the sons of Zebulun according to their families, and the border of their inheritance was as far as Sarid.

11. Their border went toward the west and to Maralah, went to Dabbasheth, and extended along the brook that is in front of Jokneam.

12. Then from Sarid it turned eastward toward the sunrise along the border of Chisloth Tabor, and went out toward Daberath, going up to Japhia.

13. And from there it passed along on the east of Gath Hepher, toward Eth Kazin, and extended to Rimmon, to Neah.

14. And the border went around it on the north side to Hannathon, and ended in the valley of Jiphthah El;

15. and included Kattath, Nahallal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.

16. This was the inheritance of the sons of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.

17. The fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the sons of Issachar according to their families.

18. And their territory went to Jezreel, and included Chesulloth, Shunem,

19. Haphraim, Shion, Anaharath,

20. Rabbith, Kishion, Abez,

21. Remeth, En Gannim, En Haddah, and Beth Pazzez.

22. And the border reached to Tabor, Shahazimah, and Beth Shemesh; their border ended at the Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.

23. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Issachar according to their families, the cities and their villages.

24. The fifth lot came out for the tribe of the sons of Asher according to their families.

25. And their territory included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph,

26. Alammelech, Amad, and Mishal; it reached to Mount Carmel westward, along the brook Shihor Libnath.

27. It turned toward the sunrise to Beth Dagon; and it reached to Zebulun and to the Valley of Jiphthah El, then northward beyond Beth Emek and Neiel, going past Cabul on the left,

28. including Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, as far as Greater Sidon.

29. And the border turned to Ramah and to the fortified city of Tyre; from there the border turned to Hosah, and ended at the sea by the region of Achzib.

30. Included also were Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob: twenty-two cities with their villages.

31. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.

32. The sixth lot came out to the sons of Naphtali, for the sons of Naphtali according to their families.

33. And their border began at Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, Adami Nekeb, and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum; it ended at the Jordan.

34. And the border turned westward to Aznoth Tabor, and went out from there toward Hukkok; it extended to Zebulun on the south side and Asher on the west side, and ended at Judah by the Jordan toward the sunrise.

35. And the fortified cities are Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth,

36. Adamah, Ramah, Hazor,

37. Kedesh, Edrei, En Hazor,

38. Iron, Migdal El, Horem, Beth Anath, and Beth Shemesh: nineteen cities with their villages.

39. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their villages.

40. The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families.

41. And the territory of their inheritance was Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir Shemesh,

42. Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Jethlah,

43. Elon, Timnah, Ekron,

44. Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath,

45. Jehud, Bene Berak, Gath Rimmon,

46. Me Jarkon, and Rakkon, with the region near Joppa.

47. And the border of the sons of Dan went beyond these, because the sons of Dan went up to fight against Leshem and took it; and they struck it with the edge of the sword, dispossessed it, and dwelt in it. They called Leshem, Dan, after the name of their father Dan.

48. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.

49. When they had made an end of dividing the land as an inheritance according to their borders, the sons of Israel gave an inheritance among them to Joshua the son of Nun.

50. According to the mouth of Jehovah they gave him the city which he asked for, Timnath Serah in the mountains of Ephraim. And he built the city and dwelt in it.

51. These were the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel divided as an inheritance by lot at Shiloh before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting. Thus they made an end of dividing up the land.

## Joshua 20

1. Jehovah also spoke to Joshua, saying,

2. Speak to the children of Israel, saying: Appoint for yourselves cities of refuge, of which I have spoken to you by the hand of Moses,

3. that the slayer who kills a soul accidentally or unintentionally may flee there; and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.

4. And when he flees to one of those cities, and stands at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declares his matter in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city to themselves, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.

5. And if the avenger of blood pursues him, they shall not deliver the slayer into his hand, because he struck his neighbor unintentionally, but did not hate him beforehand.

6. And he shall dwell in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgment, and until the death of the one who is high priest in those days. Then the slayer may return and come to his own city and his own house, to the city from which he fled.

7. So they appointed Kedesh in Galilee, in the mountains of Naphtali, Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim, and Kirjath Arba (which is Hebron) in the mountains of Judah.

8. And on the other side of the Jordan, across from Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness on the plain, of the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead, of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan, of the tribe of Manasseh.

9. These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel and for the stranger who sojourns among them, that whoever kills a soul accidentally might flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, to stand before the congregation.

## Joshua 21

1. Then the heads of the fathers of the Levites came near to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel.

2. And they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, Jehovah has commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with their common lands for our cattle.

3. And the sons of Israel gave to the Levites from their inheritance, at the mouth of Jehovah, these cities and their common lands:

4. And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites. And the sons of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, had thirteen cities by lot from the tribe of Judah, from the tribe of Simeon, and from the tribe of Benjamin.

5. The rest of the sons of Kohath had ten cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Ephraim, from the tribe of Dan, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh.

6. And the sons of Gershon had thirteen cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Issachar, from the tribe of Asher, from the tribe of Naphtali, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.

7. The sons of Merari according to their families had twelve cities from the tribe of Reuben, from the tribe of Gad, and from the tribe of Zebulun.

8. And the sons of Israel gave these cities with their common lands by lot to the Levites, as Jehovah had commanded by the hand of Moses.

9. And they gave from the tribe of the sons of Judah and from the tribe of the sons of Simeon these cities which are designated by name,

10. which were for the sons of Aaron, being of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the sons of Levi; for theirs was the first lot.

11. And they gave them Kirjath Arba (Arba was the father of Anak), which is Hebron, in the mountains of Judah, with the common land surrounding it.

12. But the fields of the city and its villages they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as his possession.

13. Thus to the sons of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its common land (a city of refuge for the slayer), and Libnah with its common land,

14. Jattir with its common land, Eshtemoa with its common land,

15. Holon with its common land, Debir with its common land,

16. Ain with its common land, Juttah with its common land, and Beth Shemesh with its common land: nine cities from those two tribes;

17. and from the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its common land, Geba with its common land,

18. Anathoth with its common land, and Almon with its common land: four cities.

19. All the cities of the sons of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their common lands.

20. And the families of the sons of Kohath, the Levites, the rest of the sons of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot from the tribe of Ephraim.

21. For they gave them Shechem with its common land in the mountains of Ephraim (a city of refuge for the slayer), Gezer with its common land,

22. Kibzaim with its common land, and Beth Horon with its common land: four cities;

23. and from the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with its common land, Gibbethon with its common land,

24. Aijalon with its common land, and Gath Rimmon with its common land: four cities;

25. and from the half-tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with its common land and Gath Rimmon with its common land: two cities.

26. All the ten cities with their common lands were for the rest of the families of the sons of Kohath.

27. Also to the sons of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, from the other half-tribe of Manasseh, they gave Golan in Bashan with its common land (a city of refuge for the slayer), and Be Eshterah with its common land: two cities;

28. and from the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with its common land, Daberath with its common land,

29. Jarmuth with its common land, and En Gannim with its common land: four cities;

30. and from the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its common land, Abdon with its common land,

31. Helkath with its common land, and Rehob with its common land: four cities;

32. and from the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its common land (a city of refuge for the slayer), Hammoth Dor with its common land, and Kartan with its common land: three cities.

33. All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their common lands.

34. And to the families of the sons of Merari, the rest of the Levites, from the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its common land, Kartah with its common land,

35. Dimnah with its common land, and Nahalal with its common land: four cities;

36. and from the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its common land, Jahaz with its common land,

37. Kedemoth with its common land, and Mephaath with its common land: four cities;

38. and from the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its common land (a city of refuge for the slayer), Mahanaim with its common land,

39. Heshbon with its common land, and Jazer with its common land: four cities in all.

40. So all the cities for the sons of Merari according to their families, the rest of the families of the Levites, were by their lot twelve cities.

41. All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty-eight cities with their common lands.

42. Every one of these cities had its common land surrounding it; thus were all these cities.

43. Thus Jehovah gave to Israel all the land of which He had sworn to give to their fathers, and they took possession of it and dwelt in it.

44. And Jehovah gave them rest all around, according to all that He had sworn to their fathers. And not a man of all their enemies stood against them; Jehovah delivered all their enemies into their hand.

45. Not a word failed of any good thing which Jehovah had spoken to the house of Israel. All came to pass.

## Joshua 22

1. Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,

2. and said to them: You have kept all that Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I have commanded you.

3. You have not left your brethren these many days, to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of Jehovah your God.

4. And now Jehovah your God has given rest to your brethren, as He has promised them; now therefore, return and go to your tents and to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Jehovah has given you on the other side of the Jordan.

5. But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the Law which Moses the servant of Jehovah has charged you, to love Jehovah your God, to walk in all His ways, to keep His commandments, to cleave unto Him, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul.

6. So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents.

7. Now to the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half of it Joshua gave a possession among their brethren on this side of the Jordan, westward. And when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them,

8. and spoke to them, saying, Return with much riches to your tents, with very much livestock, with silver, with gold, with bronze, with iron, and with very much clothing. Divide the spoils of your enemies with your brethren.

9. And the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they had obtained according to the mouth of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.

10. And when they came to the region of the Jordan in the land of Canaan, the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan; an altar of great appearance.

11. And the children of Israel heard it said, Behold, the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar across from the land of Canaan, in the regions of the Jordan, at the border of the children of Israel.

12. And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the sons of Israel gathered together at Shiloh to go to war against them.

13. Then the sons of Israel sent Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest to the sons of Reuben, to the sons of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead,

14. and with him ten leaders, each one a chief leader of a fathers house of every tribe of Israel; and each one was the head of the house of his father among the thousands of Israel.

15. And they came to the sons of Reuben, to the sons of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,

16. Thus says the whole congregation of Jehovah: What treachery is this that you have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following Jehovah, in that you have built for yourselves an altar, that you might rebel this day against Jehovah?

17. Was the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed to this day, and there was a plague in the congregation of Jehovah,

18. but that you must turn away this day from following Jehovah? And it shall be, if you rebel today against Jehovah, that tomorrow He will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.

19. Nevertheless, if the land of your possession is unclean, then cross over to the land of the possession of Jehovah, where the tabernacle of Jehovah stands, and take possession among us; but do not rebel against Jehovah, nor rebel against us, by building yourselves an altar besides the altar of Jehovah our God.

20. Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? And that man was not the only one to die in his iniquity.

21. Then the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered and said to the heads of the thousands of Israel:

22. Jehovah, the Mighty God of gods, Jehovah, the Mighty God of gods, He knows, and let Israel itself know; if it is in rebellion, or if in treachery against Jehovah, do not save us this day.

23. If we have built ourselves an altar to turn from following Jehovah, or if to offer on it burnt offerings or grain offerings, or if to offer peace offerings on it, let Jehovah Himself exact it.

24. But we have done it in this manner out of concern, thinking, In time to come your sons may speak to our sons, saying, What have you to do with Jehovah the God of Israel?

25. For Jehovah has made the Jordan a border between you and us, you sons of Reuben and sons of Gad. You have no portion in Jehovah. Thus your sons would make our sons cease to fear Jehovah.

26. Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build ourselves an altar, not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice,

27. but that it may be a witness between you and us and our generations after us, that we may perform the service of Jehovah before Him with our burnt offerings, with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your sons may not say to our sons in time to come, You have no portion in Jehovah.

28. Therefore we thought that it shall be, when they say this to us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say, Look at the pattern of the altar of Jehovah which our fathers have made, though not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between you and us.

29. Far be it from us that we should rebel against Jehovah, to turn from following Jehovah this day, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for grain offerings, or for sacrifices, besides the altar of Jehovah our God which is before His tabernacle.

30. And when Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the congregation, the heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the sons of Manasseh had spoken, it pleased them.

31. And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the sons of Manasseh, This day we perceive that Jehovah is among us, because you have not committed this treachery against Jehovah. Now you have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of Jehovah.

32. And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the leaders, returned from the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad, from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought back word to them.

33. And the thing was good in the eyes of the children of Israel, and the children of Israel blessed God and spoke no more of going against them in battle, to destroy the land where the sons of Reuben and Gad were living.

34. And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad called the altar, Witness, For it is a witness between us that Jehovah is God.

## Joshua 23

1. Now it came to pass, many days after Jehovah had given rest to Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua had grown old and advanced in age.

2. And Joshua summoned all Israel, their elders, their heads, their judges, and their officers, and said to them: I have become old and advanced in age.

3. You have seen all that Jehovah your God has done to all these nations because of you, for Jehovah your God is He who was fighting for you.

4. Behold, I have divided to you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, as far as the Great Sea westward.

5. And Jehovah your God will thrust them out before you and dispossess them before your faces. Thus you shall possess their land, as Jehovah your God has spoken to you.

6. Therefore be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, that you not turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left,

7. and that you not go among these nations, these remaining among you. You shall not make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause anyone to swear by them; you shall not serve them nor bow down to them,

8. but you shall cleave unto Jehovah your God, as you have done to this day.

9. For Jehovah has driven out before you great and mighty nations; but as for you, no one has been able to stand before you to this day.

10. One man of you shall chase a thousand, for Jehovah your God is He who is fighting for you, as He has spoken to you.

11. Therefore take diligent heed to your souls, to love Jehovah your God.

12. But if you turn back, to go away and cleave to the remnant of the nations; these that remain among you; and make marriages with them, and go in to them and they to you,

13. know and understand that Jehovah your God will no longer dispossess these nations before you. But they shall be snares and traps to you, and scourges on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land which Jehovah your God has given to you.

14. Behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth. And you know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing has failed of all the good things which Jehovah your God has spoken concerning you. All of them have come to pass for you; not one word of them has failed.

15. Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all the good things have come upon you which Jehovah your God has spoken to you, so Jehovah will bring upon you every evil thing, to destroy you from this good land which Jehovah your God has given to you.

16. When you have transgressed the covenant of Jehovah your God, which He has commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed down to them, then the anger of Jehovah will burn against you, and you shall perish quickly from off the good land which He has given to you.

## Joshua 24

1. And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem and summoned the elders of Israel, their heads, their judges, and their officers; and they presented themselves before God.

2. And Joshua said to all the people, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: Your fathers (Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor) dwelt on the other side of the River in ancient times; and they served other gods.

3. And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the River, led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed and gave him Isaac.

4. To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave the mountains of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.

5. And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to what I have done among them. Afterward I have brought you out.

6. And I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea.

7. And they cried out unto Jehovah; and He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, brought the sea upon them, and covered them. And your eyes saw what I have done in Egypt. And you dwelt in the wilderness many days.

8. And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt on the other side of the Jordan, and they fought with you. But I gave them into your hand, that you might possess their land, and I destroyed them before you.

9. Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose to make war against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you.

10. But I was not willing to heed Balaam; therefore he continued to bless you. And I delivered you out of his hand.

11. And you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho. And the lords of Jericho fought against you; also the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. But I delivered them into your hand.

12. I sent the hornet before you which drove them out before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with your sword or with your bow.

13. I have given you a land for which you have not labored, and cities which you have not built, and you dwell in them; you are eating of the vineyards and olive groves which you have not planted.

14. Now therefore, fear Jehovah, serve Him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers have served on the other side of the River and in Egypt. Serve Jehovah!

15. And if it seems evil to you to serve Jehovah, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers have served that were on the other side of the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are living. But as for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah.

16. And the people answered and said: Far be it from us to forsake Jehovah to serve other gods;

17. for Jehovah our God is He who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, who has done those great signs before our eyes, and preserved us in all the way that we have gone and among all the people through whom we have passed.

18. And Jehovah drove out before us all the people, including the Amorites who were living in the land. We also will serve Jehovah, for He is our God.

19. And Joshua said to the people, You cannot serve Jehovah, for He is a holy God. He is a jealous Mighty God; He will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.

20. If you forsake Jehovah and serve foreign gods, then He will turn and do evil and consume you, after He has done you good.

21. And the people said to Joshua, No, but we will serve Jehovah!

22. And Joshua said to the people, You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen Jehovah for yourselves, to serve Him. And they said, We are witnesses.

23. Now therefore, he said, put away the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto Jehovah the God of Israel.

24. And the people said to Joshua, Jehovah our God we will serve, and His voice we will obey!

25. So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and established for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.

26. And Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God. And he took a large stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Jehovah.

27. And Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness to us, for it has heard all the words of Jehovah which He has spoken to us. It shall therefore be a witness to you, lest you deny your God.

28. So Joshua sent the people away, each to his inheritance.

29. And it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, being one hundred and ten years old.

30. And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at Timnath Serah, in the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash.

31. And Israel served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders whose days were prolonged after Joshua, who had known all the works of Jehovah which He had done for Israel.

32. And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had brought up out of Egypt, they buried at Shechem, in the plot of ground which Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for one hundred pieces of silver, and which had become an inheritance of the sons of Joseph.

33. And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill belonging to Phinehas his son, which had been given to him in the mountains of Ephraim.
