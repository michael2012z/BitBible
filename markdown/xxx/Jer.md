# Jeremiah

## Jeremiah 1

1. The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,

2. to whom the Word of Jehovah came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.

3. It also came in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the carrying away captive of Jerusalem in the fifth month.

4. Then, the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

5. Before I formed you in the belly I knew you; and before you came forth out of the womb I consecrated you, and I ordained you a prophet to the nations.

6. Then I said, Alas, Lord Jehovah! Behold, I do not know how to speak, for I am a youth.

7. But Jehovah said to me, Do not say, I am a youth; for you shall go to all to whom I shall send you, and whatever I command you, you shall speak.

8. Do not be afraid of their faces, for I am with you to deliver you, says Jehovah.

9. And Jehovah put forth His hand, and touched my mouth. And Jehovah said to me, Behold, I have put My Words in your mouth.

10. Behold, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.

11. And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what do you see? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.

12. And Jehovah said to me, You have seen well; for I will keep watch over My Word to perform it.

13. And the Word of Jehovah came unto me the second time, saying, What do you see? And I said, I see a boiling pot; and its face is facing north.

14. And Jehovah said to me, Out of the north an evil will be unleashed upon all the inhabitants of the land.

15. For behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says Jehovah; and they shall come, and they shall each one set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls all around, and against all the cities of Judah.

16. And I will pronounce My judgments against them regarding all their evil, those who have forsaken Me, and burned incense to other gods, and bowed down to the works of their own hands.

17. You therefore gird up your loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command you. Do not be dismayed at their faces, lest I shame you before them.

18. For behold, I have made you a fortified city this day, and an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its rulers, against its priests, and against the people of the land.

19. And they shall fight against you; but they shall not prevail against you. For I am with you, says Jehovah, to deliver you.

## Jeremiah 2

1. And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

2. Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Jehovah, I remember you, the kindness of your youth, the love of your betrothals, when you went after Me in the wilderness, in a land not sown.

3. Israel was holiness to Jehovah, and the firstfruits of His increase. All that devour him shall be held guilty; evil shall come upon them, says Jehovah.

4. Hear the Word of Jehovah, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel.

5. Thus says Jehovah, What injustice have your fathers found in Me, that they have gone far from Me and have walked after vanity, and have become vain?

6. Nor did they say, Where is Jehovah who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of dry places, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man lived?

7. And I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat its fruit and its goodness; but when you entered, you defiled My land and made My inheritance an abomination.

8. The priests did not say, Where is Jehovah? And they who handle the Law did not know Me; the shepherds also rebelled against Me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.

9. Therefore I will contend with you, says Jehovah, and with your childrens children I will make a complaint.

10. For pass over the coasts of Kittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider carefully, and see if there is such a thing.

11. Has a nation changed their gods, which are not gods? But My people have changed their Glory for that which does not profit.

12. Be appalled, O heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid; be greatly desolated, says Jehovah.

13. For My people have committed two evils; they have forsaken Me, the Fountain of Living Waters, to hew out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water.

14. Is Israel a servant? Or is he a homeborn slave? Why is he plundered?

15. The young lions roared against him; they uttered their voice. And they made his land a waste; his cities are burned without inhabitant.

16. Also the children of Noph and Tahpanhes have fed on your crown.

17. Have you not brought this upon yourself, in that you have forsaken Jehovah your God, when He led you by the way?

18. And now what are you doing on the way toward Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? Or what are you doing, going toward Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?

19. Your own evil shall correct you, and your backslidings shall reprove you. Therefore know and see that it is an evil and bitter thing that you have forsaken Jehovah your God, and that My fear is not in you, says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts.

20. For long ago you broke your yoke and tore apart your bonds; and you said, I will not transgress, when on every high hill and under every green tree you lay down like a harlot.

21. Yet I planted you a noble vine, a true seed. How then have you turned into the degenerate shoots of an alien vine to Me?

22. For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap, yet your iniquity is stained before Me, says the Lord Jehovah.

23. How can you say, I am not defiled; I have not gone after the Baals? See your way in the valley, know what you have done! You are a swift camel crisscrossing its ways.

24. A wild ass used to the wilderness, in her cravings she sniffs at the wind; when she is in heat who can turn her away? All those who seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they will find her.

25. Withhold your foot from being bare, and your throat from thirst. But you said, There is no hope. No! For I have loved strangers, and after them I will go.

26. As the thief is ashamed when he is found out, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their rulers, and their priests, and their prophets;

27. saying to a tree, You are my father; and to a stone, You gave birth to me. For they have turned their back to Me, and not their face; but in the time of their distress they will say, Arise and save us!

28. But where are your gods that you have made for yourselves? Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your distress; for according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah.

29. Why will you plead with Me? You all have rebelled against Me, says Jehovah.

30. In vain I have chastened your children; they received no correction. Your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.

31. O generation, see the Word of Jehovah. Have I been a wilderness to Israel, or a land of darkness? Why do My people say, We roam freely; we will come no more to You?

32. Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet My people have forgotten Me days without number.

33. Why do you beautify your way to seek love? Therefore you have also taught the evil women your ways.

34. Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents; I did not find them by secret search, but plainly on all these.

35. Yet you say, Because I am innocent, surely His anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with you, because you say, I have not sinned.

36. Why do you gad about so much to change your way? You also shall be ashamed of Egypt, as you were ashamed of Assyria.

37. Indeed, you shall go out from this place, with your hands on your head. For Jehovah has rejected those in whom you trust, and you will not prosper by them.

## Jeremiah 3

1. They say, If a man puts away his wife, and she goes from him and becomes another mans, shall he return to her again? Would not that land be greatly polluted? But you have committed adultery with many lovers; yet turn back to Me, says Jehovah.

2. Lift up your eyes to the desolate heights, and see. Where have you not been lain with and ravished? By the highways you have sat for them, like an Arabian in the wilderness; and you have polluted the land with your harlotry and with your evil.

3. Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; and you had a harlots forehead; you refused to be ashamed.

4. Will you not now cry to Me, My father, You are the guide of my youth?

5. Will He keep His anger forever? Will He keep it to the end? Behold, you have spoken and done all the evil things you could.

6. Jehovah also said to me in the days of Josiah the king, Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? She has gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and has committed adultery there.

7. And after she had done all these things I said, Turn back to Me! But she did not return. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.

8. And I saw, when for all the causes for which backsliding Israel committed adultery, I put her away and gave her a certificate of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but she also went and committed adultery.

9. So it came to pass through the wantonness of her harlotry, that she defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and pieces of wood.

10. And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not returned to Me with her whole heart, but in pretense, says Jehovah.

11. And Jehovah said to me, Backsliding Israel has shown herself to be more righteous than treacherous Judah.

12. Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, O backsliding Israel, says Jehovah; and I will not cause My anger to fall upon you; for I am merciful, says Jehovah, and I will not keep anger forever.

13. Only, acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against Jehovah your God and have scattered your ways to strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed My voice, says Jehovah.

14. Return, O backsliding children, says Jehovah; for I am married to you. And I will take you, one from a city, and two from a family; and I will bring you to Zion.

15. And I will give you shepherds according to My heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.

16. And it shall come to pass, when you have multiplied and increased in the land in those days, says Jehovah, that they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of Jehovah! Nor shall it come to mind; nor shall they remember it; nor shall they seek it; nor shall it be made anymore.

17. At that time Jerusalem shall be called, The Throne of Jehovah; and all the nations shall be gathered to it, to the name of Jehovah, to Jerusalem. Nor shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil hearts.

18. In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance to your fathers.

19. But I said, How shall I put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a beautiful inheritance among the multitudes of nations! And I said, You shall call Me, My Father, and shall not turn away from Me.

20. Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her companion, so you have dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, says Jehovah.

21. A voice was heard on the desolate heights; weeping and supplications of the children of Israel; for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten Jehovah their God.

22. Return, O backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come to You; for You are Jehovah our God.

23. Truly, deception comes from the high hills, from the multitudes on the mountains. Truly, in Jehovah our God is the salvation of Israel.

24. For shame has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.

25. We lie down in our shame, and our reproach covers us; for we have sinned against Jehovah our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God.

## Jeremiah 4

1. If you will return, O Israel, says Jehovah, return to Me. And if you will put away your abominations out of My sight, then you shall not waver.

2. And you shall swear, Jehovah lives, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in Him, and in Him they shall glory.

3. For thus says Jehovah to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and do not sow among thorns.

4. Circumcise yourselves to Jehovah, and take away the foreskins of your hearts, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest My fury come forth like fire, and burn so that no one can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.

5. Declare in Judah, and let it be heard in Jerusalem; and say, Blow the shofar in the land; cry out, gather together, and say, Gather yourselves and let us go into the fortified cities.

6. Set up the standard toward Zion, take refuge, do not wait around; for I will bring evil from the north, and great destruction.

7. The lion has come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the nations has set out; he has gone forth from his place to make your land a waste. Your cities will fall into ruins without inhabitant.

8. Put on sackcloth for this, wail and howl; for the fierce anger of Jehovah is not turned back from us.

9. And it shall come to pass in that day, says Jehovah, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the rulers; and the priests shall be appalled, and the prophets shall be stunned.

10. Then I said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! Surely You have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, You shall have peace; whereas the sword reaches to the soul.

11. At that time it shall be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind from the desolate heights in the wilderness blows toward the daughter of My people, not to sift nor to cleanse.

12. A full wind from these places shall come unto Me. Now also I will pronounce judgment against them.

13. Behold, he shall come up like clouds, and his chariots like a tempest. His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us, for we are plundered!

14. O Jerusalem, wash your heart from evil so that you may be saved. How long shall your vain thoughts lodge within you?

15. For a voice declares from Dan, and proclaims affliction from Mount Ephraim.

16. Tell it to the nations: Behold! proclaim against Jerusalem! Watchers are going to come from a distant land; and they will utter their voice against the cities of Judah.

17. Like keepers of a field, they are against her all around; because she has rebelled against Me, says Jehovah.

18. Your way and your doings have procured these things for you; this is your evil, because it is bitter, because it reaches to your heart.

19. My stomach, my stomach! I am convulsed to my heart! My heart groans within me; I cannot be silent because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the shofar, the alarm of war.

20. Destruction upon destruction is proclaimed; for the whole land is devastated. Suddenly my tents are destroyed, my curtains in a moment.

21. How long shall I see the standard and hear the sound of the shofar?

22. For My people are foolish; they have not known Me; they are foolish children, and they have no understanding. They are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.

23. I looked on the earth, and, lo, it was without form and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.

24. I looked on the mountains, and, lo, they quaked; and all the hills moved to and fro.

25. I looked, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens had fled.

26. I looked, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of Jehovah, before His fierce anger.

27. For thus Jehovah has said, The whole land shall be desolate, yet I will not make a full end.

28. The earth shall mourn for this, and the heavens above shall be black, because I have spoken, I have purposed, and will not be moved to pity, nor will I turn back from it.

29. Every city shall flee at the sound of the horsemen and bowmen. They shall go into thickets and climb up among the rocks. Every city is abandoned, and not a man shall live in them.

30. And you, what will you do when you are ruined? Though you dress with crimson, though you put on ornaments of gold, though you make your eyes large with paint, you shall make yourself beautiful in vain; your lovers will despise you; they will seek your life.

31. For I have heard a voice as of a woman in labor, the anguish as of one bearing her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, gasping and spreading her hands, saying, Woe to me now! For my soul is weary because of murderers.

## Jeremiah 5

1. Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in her open places, if you can find a man, if there is one who does justice, who seeks the truth; and I will pardon her.

2. And though they say, As Jehovah lives; surely they swear falsely.

3. O Jehovah, are not Your eyes on the truth? You have stricken them, but they have not grieved; You have destroyed them, but they have refused to receive correction; they have made their faces harder than rock; they have refused to return.

4. So I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish; for they do not know the way of Jehovah, nor the judgment of their God.

5. I will go to the great men, and will speak to them; for they have known the way of Jehovah and the judgment of their God. But these have broken the yoke together and have torn off the bonds!

6. Therefore a lion out of the forest shall kill them, and a wolf of the deserts shall destroy them; a leopard shall watch over their cities. Everyone who goes out from there shall be torn in pieces, because their transgressions are many and their backslidings are increased.

7. How shall I pardon you for this? Your children have forsaken Me, and have sworn by those that are not gods. When I adjured them, then they committed adultery, and gathered themselves by troops in a harlots house.

8. They were like lusty, well-fed stallions in the morning; every one neighing after his neighbors wife.

9. Shall I not punish for these things? says Jehovah. And shall not My soul be avenged on such a nation as this?

10. Go up on her vine rows and destroy; but do not make a full end; take away her branches, for they are not Jehovahs.

11. For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against Me, says Jehovah.

12. They have denied Jehovah and said, It is not He; neither shall evil come upon us; nor shall we see sword nor famine.

13. And the prophets shall become wind, for the Word is not in them; thus it shall be done to them.

14. Therefore thus says Jehovah the God of Hosts, Because you speak this word, behold, I will make My Words in your mouth fire, and these people wood, and it shall devour them.

15. Lo, I will bring a nation against you from afar, O house of Israel, says Jehovah. It is an enduring nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you do not know, nor understand what they say.

16. Their quiver is as an open grave; they are all mighty men.

17. And they shall eat up your harvest and your bread. They will devour your sons and your daughters. They shall eat up your flocks and your herds; they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees. They shall beat down your fortified cities, in which you trust, with the sword.

18. But even in those days, says Jehovah, I will not make a complete end of you.

19. And it will be when you shall say, Why does Jehovah our God do all these things to us? then you shall answer them, Just as you have forsaken Me and served foreign gods in your land, so you shall serve strangers in a land that is not yours.

20. Declare this in the house of Jacob, and proclaim it in Judah, saying,

21. Now hear this, O foolish people, without understanding; who have eyes and see not; who have ears and hear not.

22. Do you not fear Me? says Jehovah. Will you not tremble at My presence, I who have placed the sand for the boundary of the sea by a perpetual decree, so that it cannot pass it? And though its waves toss to and fro, yet they cannot prevail; though they roar, yet they cannot pass over it?

23. But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart; they have turned aside and departed.

24. Neither do they say in their heart, Let us now fear Jehovah our God, who gives both the former and the latter rain in its season; He reserves unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.

25. Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withheld good from you.

26. For among My people are found wicked ones; they lie in wait, as one who sets snares; they set a trap, they catch men.

27. Like a cage full of birds, so their houses are full of deceit; therefore they have become great and grown rich.

28. They have grown fat, they gleam. Yes, they surpass the deeds of the wicked; they do not plead the cause, the cause of the fatherless, that they may get rich; and they do not judge the right of the needy.

29. Shall I not punish for these things? says Jehovah. Shall not My soul be avenged on such a nation as this?

30. An appalling and horrible thing has happened in the land.

31. The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their own power; and my people love to have it so, and what will you do in the end?

## Jeremiah 6

1. O children of Benjamin, seek refuge out of the midst of Jerusalem. Blow the shofar in Tekoa, and set up a signal-fire in Beth-haccerem; for evil appears out of the north, and great destruction.

2. I will destroy the daughter of Zion, being delicate in her dwelling place.

3. The shepherds with their flocks shall come to her; they shall pitch tents against her all around; they shall feed each one in his place.

4. Prepare war against her; arise and let us go up at noon. Woe to us! For the day goes away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.

5. Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.

6. For thus has Jehovah of Hosts said, Cut down trees and cast a mound against Jerusalem! This is the city to be punished; she is full of oppression in her midst.

7. As a fountain keeps fresh its waters, so she keeps fresh her evil; violence and devastation is heard in her; before Me continually are sickness and wounds.

8. O Jerusalem, be instructed, lest My soul depart from you; lest I make you desolate, a land not inhabited.

9. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel like a vine; as a grape gatherer, put your hand back to the branches.

10. To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? Behold, their ears are uncircumcised, and they cannot give heed. Behold, the Word of Jehovah is a reproach to them; they have no delight in it.

11. Therefore I am full of the fury of Jehovah; I am weary with holding it in; I will pour it out on the children outside, and on the group of young men together. For even the husband shall be taken along with the wife, the aged who is full of days.

12. And their houses shall be turned over to others, together with their fields and wives; for I will stretch out My hand upon the inhabitants of the land, says Jehovah.

13. For everyone from the least of them even to the greatest of them profits from unjust gain; and from the prophet even to the priest everyone deals falsely.

14. They have also healed the ruin of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.

15. Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed, nor did they know how to blush; therefore they shall fall among those who fall. At the time that I punish them they shall be cast down, says Jehovah.

16. Thus says Jehovah, Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths where the good way is, and walk in it, and you shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk in it.

17. Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Listen to the sound of the shofar. But they said, We will not listen.

18. Therefore hear, you nations, and know, O congregation, what is coming upon them.

19. Hear, O earth; behold, I will bring evil on this people, the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not heeded My Words, nor My Law, but rejected it.

20. For what purpose does frankincense come to Me from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not pleasing, nor are your sacrifices sweet to Me.

21. Therefore thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall stumble on them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.

22. Thus says Jehovah, Behold, a people comes from the land of the north, and a great nation shall be aroused from the extremities of the earth.

23. They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel and have no mercy; their voice roars like the sea; and they ride on horses, set in array against you as men of war, O daughter of Zion.

24. We have heard the rumor of it; our hands become feeble; anguish has taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in labor.

25. Do not go out into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and fear are on every side.

26. O daughter of my people, put on sackcloth, and wallow in ashes; make mourning for yourself, as for an only son, most bitter wailing; for the destruction shall suddenly come upon us.

27. I have set you up as an inspector, and a fortress among My people, that you may know and examine their way.

28. They all stubbornly rebel, walking in slanders; they are bronze and iron; they are all corrupters.

29. The bellows are scorched, the lead is consumed by the fire; the refiner melts in vain; for the wicked are not drawn off.

30. Rejected silver they call them, because Jehovah has rejected them.

## Jeremiah 7

1. The Word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,

2. Stand in the gate of the house of Jehovah, and proclaim there this Word, and say, Hear the Word of Jehovah, all Judah, who enter in at these gates to bow down to Jehovah.

3. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, Make your ways and your doings good, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.

4. Do not trust in lying words, saying, The temple of Jehovah, The temple of Jehovah, This is the temple of Jehovah.

5. For if you thoroughly make your ways and your doings good; if you work to execute justice between a man and his neighbor;

6. if you do not oppress the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place, nor walk after other gods to your hurt;

7. then I will cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, forever and ever.

8. Behold, you trust in lying words that are of no benefit.

9. Will you steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods whom you do not know;

10. and then come and stand before Me in this house which is called by My name, and say, We are delivered to do all those abominations?

11. Has this house, which is called by My name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have seen it, says Jehovah.

12. But go now to My place which was in Shiloh, where I set My name at the first, and see what I did to it because of the evil of My people Israel.

13. And now, because you have done all these works, says Jehovah, and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you did not hear; and I called you, but you did not answer;

14. therefore I will do to this house, which is called by My name, in which you trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.

15. And I will cast you out of My sight, as I have cast out all your brothers, the whole seed of Ephraim.

16. Therefore do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry nor prayer for them, nor make intercession to Me; for I will not hear you.

17. Do you not see what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?

18. The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes to the Queen of Heaven and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke Me to anger.

19. Do they provoke Me to anger? says Jehovah. Is it not themselves, to the shame of their own faces.

20. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Behold, My anger and My fury shall be poured out on this place, on man, and on beast, and on the trees of the field, and on the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.

21. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Snatch away your burnt offerings from your sacrifices, and eat flesh.

22. For I did not speak to your fathers, nor command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices.

23. But this is what I commanded them, saying, Obey My voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be My people; and walk in all the ways that I have commanded you, so that it may be well with you.

24. But they did not listen, nor extend their ear, but walked in their own plans, in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward and not forward.

25. Since the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day I have even sent to you all My servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them.

26. Yet they did not listen to Me, nor extend their ear, but hardened their neck. They did worse than their fathers.

27. Therefore you shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you; you shall also call to them, but they will not answer you.

28. But you shall say to them, This is a nation which does not obey the voice of Jehovah their God, nor receives instruction; truth has perished, and is cut off from their mouth.

29. Cut off your hair and throw it away, and take up a lamentation on the desolate heights. For Jehovah has rejected and forsaken the generation of His wrath.

30. For the sons of Judah have done evil in My eyes, says Jehovah. They have set their abominations in the house which is called by My name, in order to defile it.

31. They have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I did not command them, nor did it even come into My heart.

32. Therefore behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter. For they shall bury in Tophet, until there is no more room.

33. And the carcasses of this people shall be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth; and no one will frighten them away.

34. Then I will cause the voice of gladness to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem, and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride. For the land shall be desolate.

## Jeremiah 8

1. At that time, says Jehovah, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of its rulers, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves.

2. And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of the heavens, which they have loved and which they have served, and after which they have walked, and which they have sought, and to which they have bowed down. They shall not be gathered nor buried; they shall be as dung on the face of the earth.

3. And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the rest of those who remain of this evil family, who remain in all the places where I have driven them, says Jehovah of Hosts.

4. Moreover you shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah, Shall they fall and not arise? Shall he turn away and not return?

5. Why has this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a continual backsliding? They hold fast to deceit; they refuse to return.

6. I listened and heard, but they did not speak right; no man repented of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? Everyone turned to his own course, as a horse rushes into the battle.

7. Yea, the stork in the heavens knows her appointed times; and the turtledove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming; but my people do not know the judgment of Jehovah.

8. How can you say, We are wise, and the Law of Jehovah is with us? Lo, certainly the lying pen of the scribes has written falsehood.

9. The wise are ashamed, they are dismayed, and are captured. Lo, they have rejected the Word of Jehovah; so what wisdom is in them?

10. Therefore I will give their wives to others, and their fields to those who shall inherit them, for everyone from the least even to the greatest profits from unjust gain. From the prophet even to the priest everyone deals falsely.

11. For they have healed the ruin of the daughter of My people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.

12. Were they ashamed when they had committed abominations? No, they were not at all ashamed, nor did they know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; in the time of their punishment they shall be cast down, says Jehovah.

13. I will utterly consume them, says Jehovah; there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; I give them to those who pass through.

14. Why do we sit still? Gather yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there. For Jehovah our God has put us to silence, and has given us bitter water to drink, because we have sinned against Jehovah.

15. We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, but behold, terror!

16. The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan; the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his valiant ones. For they have come, and devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those who live in it.

17. For, behold, I will send serpents and vipers among you, which cannot be charmed; and they shall bite you, says Jehovah.

18. I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint within me.

19. Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a distant land. Is not Jehovah in Zion? Is not her King in her? Why have they provoked Me to anger with their graven images, with foreign vanities?

20. The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.

21. For the ruin of the daughter of my people I am broken; I am in gloom; horror has seized me.

22. Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has the healing of the daughter of my people not come?

## Jeremiah 9

1. Oh that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!

2. Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place for travelers, that I might leave my people and go away from them! For they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.

3. And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies. But they are not mighty for the truth on the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they do not know Me, says Jehovah.

4. Everyone beware of his neighbor, and do not trust any brother! For every brother will supplant and assail his neighbor, and will walk with slanderers.

5. And everyone will deceive his neighbor and will not speak the truth; they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and they weary themselves to commit iniquity.

6. Your dwelling is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know Me, says Jehovah.

7. Therefore thus says Jehovah of Hosts, Behold, I will refine them and try them; for how else shall I deal with the daughter of My people?

8. Their tongue is a slaughtering arrow; it speaks deceit; one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his heart he lies in wait.

9. Shall I not punish them for these things? says Jehovah; shall not My soul be avenged on such a nation as this?

10. I will take up a weeping and a wailing for the mountains, and a lamentation for the pastures of the wilderness; because they are burned up, so that no one can pass through them; nor can men hear the voice of the cattle. Both the birds of the heavens and the beasts have fled; they are gone.

11. And I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.

12. Who is the wise man who may understand this? And who is he to whom the mouth of Jehovah has spoken, that he may declare it? Why does the land perish and burn up like a wilderness, so that no one passes through?

13. And Jehovah says, Because they have forsaken My Law which I set before them, and have not obeyed My voice, and have not walked in it,

14. but they have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Baals, which their fathers taught them.

15. Therefore thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and make them drink bitter water.

16. I will also scatter them among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known. And I will send a sword after them until I have consumed them.

17. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, Consider carefully, and call for those who lament, that they may come. And send for the wise women, that they may come;

18. and let them make haste and take up a lamentation for us, so that our eyes may run down with tears, and waters flow from our eyelids.

19. For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion. How we are plundered! We are greatly ashamed, because we have forsaken the land, because they have thrown down our tents.

20. Yet hear the Word of Jehovah, O women, and let your ear receive the Word of His mouth, and teach your daughters a mourning song, and each one teach her neighbor a lamentation.

21. For death has come up into our windows, and has entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from outside and the young men from the streets.

22. Speak, Thus says Jehovah, Even the carcasses of men shall fall as dung on the open field, and as the fallen grain after the reaper; and no one shall gather them.

23. Thus says Jehovah, Let not the wise glory in his wisdom, nor let the mighty glory in his might; let not the rich glory in his riches;

24. but let him who glories glory in this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am Jehovah, doing kindness, justice, and righteousness in the earth; for in these things I delight, says Jehovah.

25. Behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will punish all the circumcised along with the uncircumcised;

26. Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all who are in the remotest quarters, who dwell in the wilderness. For all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.

## Jeremiah 10

1. Hear the Word which Jehovah speaks to you, O house of Israel.

2. Thus says Jehovah, Do not learn the way of the nations, and do not be dismayed at the signs of the heavens; for the nations are dismayed at them.

3. For the customs of the people are vain; for one cuts a tree out of the forest with the ax, the work of the hands of the craftsman.

4. They make it beautiful with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and hammers, so that it will not totter.

5. They are crafted into hammered work like a palm tree, and they cannot speak. They must be lifted up and carried, because they cannot walk. Do not be afraid of them; for they are not able to do evil, neither is it in them to do good.

6. There is none like You, O Jehovah; You are great, and Your name is great in might.

7. Who would not fear You, O King of nations? For fear is befitting to You, because among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You.

8. But they are, every one of them, dull-hearted and foolish; a piece of wood is a discipline in vanities.

9. Silver beaten into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the craftsman, and of the hands of the goldsmith. Violet and purple is their clothing; they are all the work of skillful ones.

10. But Jehovah is the true God, He is the living God, and the eternal King. At His wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to endure His indignation.

11. So you shall say to them, The gods who have not made the heavens and the earth, they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens.

12. He has made the earth by His power; He has established the world by His wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by His understanding.

13. When He utters His voice, there is the noise of much water in the heavens. He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; He makes lightnings with the rain, and brings forth the wind out of His treasures.

14. Every man is stupid in his knowledge; every refiner is dried up by the graven image; for his molten image is a lie, and no breath is in them.

15. They are vanity, the work of delusion; in the time of their judgment they shall perish.

16. The Portion of Jacob is not like them; for He is the Maker of all things; and Israel is the rod of His inheritance. Jehovah of Hosts is His name.

17. Gather up your bundle from the ground, you who live under the siege.

18. For thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land this once, and will distress them, so that they may find Me.

19. Woe to me for my ruin! My wound makes me sick. But I said, Surely this is an infirmity, and I must bear it.

20. My tent is plundered, and all my cords are broken; my children have gone away from me, and they are not. There is no one to stretch out my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.

21. For the shepherds have become stupid, and have not sought Jehovah, therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.

22. Behold, the sound of the report has come, and a great commotion out of the land of the north, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a den of dragons.

23. O Jehovah, I know that the way of man is not in himself; it is not in man who walks to direct his own steps.

24. O Jehovah, correct me, but with justice; not in Your anger, lest You bring me to nothing.

25. Pour out Your fury on the nations who do not know You, and on the families who do not call on Your name; for they have eaten up Jacob and have devoured him, and have destroyed him, and have made his dwelling place desolate.

## Jeremiah 11

1. The Word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah saying,

2. Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,

3. and say to them, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Cursed is the man who does not obey the words of this covenant,

4. which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey My voice and do according to all that I command you; so you shall be My people, and I will be your God;

5. so that I may fulfill the oath which I have sworn to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then I answered and said, Amen, O Jehovah.

6. Then Jehovah said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear the words of this covenant, and do them.

7. For I admonished and testified to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, until this day, rising early and exhorting, saying, Obey My voice.

8. Yet they did not obey nor extend their ear, but walked each one in the stubbornness of his evil heart. Therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do; but they did not do them.

9. And Jehovah said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

10. They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear My Words. And they went after other gods, to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers.

11. Therefore Jehovah says this: Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry to Me, I will not listen to them.

12. Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to whom they offer incense. But they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.

13. For according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah. And according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem you have set up altars to that shameful thing, altars to burn incense to Baal.

14. Therefore, do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry out to Me because of their trouble.

15. What is My beloved doing in My house, since she has worked out many evil devices? Has the holy flesh taken away your evil from you? How then do you rejoice?

16. Jehovah called your name, Green Olive Tree, fair, with fine fruit. With a great roaring sound He has set fire to it, and its branches are broken.

17. For Jehovah of Hosts who planted you has pronounced evil against you, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke Me to anger by offering incense to Baal.

18. And Jehovah gave me knowledge of it, and I made it known; for You showed me their doings.

19. But I was like a docile lamb being led to the slaughter. And I did not know that they had devised schemes against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, so that his name may be remembered no more.

20. But, O Jehovah of Hosts, who judges righteously, who tries the mind and the heart, let me see Your vengeance on them. For to You I have laid open my cause.

21. Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning the men of Anathoth who seek your life, saying, Do not prophesy in the name of Jehovah, that you do not die by our hand.

22. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, Behold, I will punish them. The young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;

23. and there shall be no remnant of them. For I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their punishment.

## Jeremiah 12

1. Righteous are You, O Jehovah, when I complain to You; yet let me speak with You about Your judgments. Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why are all those who deceive with treachery at ease?

2. You have planted them; yea, they take root. They grow, yea, they bring forth fruit. You are near in their mouth, but far from their heart.

3. But You, O Jehovah, know me. You have seen me and tried my heart toward You. Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and consecrate them for the day of slaughter.

4. How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither from the evil of those who dwell in it? The beasts and the birds have been swept away; because they said, He shall not see our last end.

5. If you have run with footmen, and they wore you out, then how can you compete with horses? And if you feel secure in the land of peace, then how will you do in the swelling of the Jordan?

6. For even your brothers and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you. Yea, they have called out a multitude after you. Do not believe them, though they speak pleasant things to you.

7. I have forsaken My house; I have left My inheritance. I have given the dearly beloved of My soul into the hand of her enemies.

8. My inheritance is to Me as a lion in the forest; it cries out against Me; therefore I have hated it.

9. My inheritance is like a speckled bird to Me; the birds all around are against her. Go, gather all the beasts of the field, bring them to devour.

10. Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard; they have trampled My portion under foot; they have made My pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.

11. They have made it a desolation. Being desolate, it mourns to Me. The whole land is made desolate because no man lays it to heart.

12. The plunderers have come upon all high places through the wilderness; for the sword of Jehovah shall devour from one end of the land even to the other end of the land. No flesh shall have peace.

13. They have sown wheat, but reap thorns. They have tired themselves out, but to no profit. And they shall be ashamed of your harvests because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.

14. Thus says Jehovah against all My evil neighbors who touch the inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit: Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.

15. And it shall be, after I have plucked them out, that I will return and have compassion on them, and will bring them back, each man to his inheritance and each man to his land.

16. And it shall be, if they will carefully learn the ways of My people, to swear by My name, As Jehovah lives (as they taught the people to swear by Baal), then they shall be established in the midst of My people.

17. But if they will not obey, I will pull up, root out, and destroy that nation, says Jehovah.

## Jeremiah 13

1. Thus Jehovah said to me, Go and buy for yourself a linen waistband, and put it around your waist, and do not put it in water.

2. So I bought a waistband according to the Word of Jehovah, and put it around my waist.

3. And the Word of Jehovah came unto me a second time, saying,

4. Take the waistband that you bought, which is around your waist, and arise. Go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.

5. So I went and hid it by Euphrates, as Jehovah commanded me.

6. And it came to pass at the end of many days that Jehovah said to me, Arise, go to the Euphrates and take the waistband from there, which I commanded you to hide there.

7. Then I went to the Euphrates and dug, and took the waistband from the place where I had hidden it. And, behold, the waistband was rotten; it was good for nothing.

8. Then the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

9. Thus says Jehovah, In this way I will spoil the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.

10. This evil people, who refuse to hear My Words, who walk in the stubbornness of their heart and walk after other gods to serve them and to bow down to them, shall even be like this waistband, which is good for nothing.

11. For as the waistband clings to the waist of a man, so I have caused the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah to cling to Me, says Jehovah; so that they might be a people unto Me, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory; but they would not hear.

12. So you shall speak to them this Word: Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine. And they shall say to you, Do we not perceive to know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?

13. Then you shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit on Davids throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.

14. And I will smash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, says Jehovah. I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but will destroy them.

15. Hear and give ear; do not be proud; for Jehovah has spoken.

16. Give glory to Jehovah your God, before He causes darkness, and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains, and, while you are looking for light, He turns it into the shadow of death, and makes it gross darkness.

17. But if you will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride; and my eye shall weep and cry and run down with tears, because Jehovahs flock is taken captive.

18. Say to the king and to the queen mother, Humble yourselves; sit down, for your dominion has come down, even the crown of your glory.

19. The cities of the south have been shut up, and no one is opening; Judah has been exiled, all of it has been completely carried away captive.

20. Lift up your eyes and look at those who come from the north. Where is the flock that was given to you, your beautiful sheep?

21. What will you say when he punishes you? For you have taught them to be chief rulers over you. Do not pangs seize you, like a woman in travail?

22. And if you say in your heart, Why have these things come upon me? It is because of the greatness of your iniquity; your skirts have been uncovered, and your heels have suffered violence.

23. Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard its spots? Then you also may do good, who are accustomed to doing evil.

24. Therefore I will scatter them as the stubble that passes away by the wind of the wilderness.

25. This is your lot, the portion I have measured to you, says Jehovah, because you have forgotten Me and trusted in falsehood.

26. Therefore I also have drawn up your skirts over your face, that your shame may be seen.

27. I have seen your adulteries, and your neighings, the lewdness of your harlotry, and your abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! Will you not be made clean? How long will it still be?

## Jeremiah 14

1. The Word of Jehovah that came unto Jeremiah concerning the droughts.

2. Judah mourns, and its gates languish. They mourn for the land, and the cry of Jerusalem has gone up.

3. And their nobles have sent their little ones for water; they came to the cisterns, and found no water. They returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.

4. Because the ground is parched, for there was no rain on the earth, the plowmen were ashamed; they covered their heads.

5. Yea, the doe also gave birth in the field and abandoned it, because there was no grass.

6. And the wild asses stood in the high places; they sniffed at the wind like dragons; their eyes failed because there was no grass.

7. O Jehovah, though our iniquities testify against us, work for Your names sake; for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against You.

8. O the Hope of Israel, its Savior in time of trouble, why should You be like a sojourner in the land, and like a traveler who turns aside to lodge for the night?

9. Why should You be like a man astonished, as a mighty one who cannot save? Yet You, O Jehovah, are in our midst, and we are called by Your name. Do not leave us!

10. Thus says Jehovah to this people: Thus they have loved to wander; they have not restrained their feet; therefore Jehovah does not accept them. He will now remember their iniquity and punish their sins.

11. Then Jehovah said to me, Do not pray for this people for their good.

12. When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I will not accept them. But I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.

13. Then I said, Ah, O Lord Jehovah! Behold, the prophets are saying to them, You shall not see the sword, nor shall you have famine; but I will give you sure peace in this place.

14. And Jehovah said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in My name; I did not send them, nor have I commanded them, nor did I speak to them. They prophesy to you a false vision and a worthless divination, and a thing of no value, and the deceit of their heart.

15. Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning the prophets who prophesy in My name, when I did not send them (yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land): by sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed.

16. And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have no one to bury them; either them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters. For I will pour their evil upon them.

17. Therefore you shall speak this word to them: Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and do not let them cease. For the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great break, with a sickening blow.

18. If I go out into the field, then I see those killed with the sword! And if I enter into the city, then, behold, those that are sick from famine! Yes, both the prophet and the priest have gone up into a land that they do not know.

19. Have You utterly rejected Judah? Has Your soul loathed Zion? Why have You stricken us such that there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for the time of healing, and behold, terror!

20. We acknowledge, O Jehovah, our wickedness, the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against You.

21. Do not abhor us; for Your names sake do not disgrace the throne of Your glory; remember, do not break Your covenant with us.

22. Are there any among the vain idols of the nations who can make it rain? Or can the heavens give showers? Is it not You, O Jehovah our God. Therefore we will wait upon You; for You have made all these things.

## Jeremiah 15

1. Then Jehovah said to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before Me, My soul could not be inclined toward this people. Send them out of My sight, and let them go out.

2. And it shall come to pass that if they say to you, Where shall we go? Then you shall tell them, Thus says Jehovah: Those who are for death, to death; and those for the sword, to the sword; and those for the famine, to the famine; and those for the captivity, to the captivity.

3. And I will set over them four kinds, says Jehovah; the sword to kill, and the dogs to drag, and the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.

4. And I will make them a horror to all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem.

5. For who shall have pity on you, O Jerusalem? Or who shall bemoan you? Or who shall turn aside to ask after your welfare?

6. You have forsaken Me, says Jehovah; you have gone backward; therefore I will stretch out My hand against you, and destroy you; I am weary with sorrow.

7. And I will winnow them with a pitch fork in the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children; I will destroy My people, since they have not turned back from their ways.

8. Their widows are more numerous around Me than the sand of the seas; I have brought on them, against a mother of a young man, a plunderer at noonday; I have caused anguish and terror to fall suddenly upon the city.

9. She who bore seven languishes; she has breathed out her life; her sun has gone down while it was yet day. She has been ashamed and confounded; and I will deliver the rest of them to the sword before their enemies, says Jehovah.

10. Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me, a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither loaned with usury, nor have men loaned to me; yet every one curses me.

11. Jehovah said, Truly I will not free you for good. Truly I will cause the enemy to entreat you in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.

12. Can anyone break iron, iron or bronze from the north?

13. Your wealth and your treasures I will give as spoils without price, because of all your sins, even in all your borders.

14. And I will make you pass over with your enemies into a land which you do not know. For a fire has been kindled in My anger, which shall burn against you.

15. O Jehovah, You know; remember me and visit me, and take vengeance for me on those who persecute me. In Your long-suffering do not take me away; know that for Your sake I have suffered rebuke.

16. Your Words were found, and I ate them; and Your Word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart; for I am called by Your name, O Jehovah the God of Hosts.

17. I did not sit in the council of the mockers, nor rejoice; I sat alone because of Your hand; for You have filled me with indignation.

18. Why has my pain been continual, and my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? You surely are to me like deceitful waters that cannot be trusted.

19. Therefore thus says Jehovah, If you turn back, then I will bring you back again; you shall stand before Me. And if you take the precious out from the vile, you shall be as My mouth. Let them turn back to you, but do not return to them.

20. And I will make you to this people a fortified wall of bronze; and they shall fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you; for I am with you to save you and to deliver you, says Jehovah.

21. And I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem you out of the grip of the terrible.

## Jeremiah 16

1. The Word of Jehovah also came unto me, saying,

2. You shall not take a wife for yourself, nor shall you have sons or daughters in this place.

3. For thus says Jehovah concerning the sons and concerning the daughters who are born in this place, and concerning their mothers who bore them, and concerning their fathers who begot them in this land:

4. They shall die from deaths of diseases; they shall not be mourned, nor shall they be buried. But they shall be as dung on the face of the earth. They shall be destroyed by the sword and by famine; and their carcasses shall be food for the birds of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth.

5. For thus says Jehovah, Do not enter into the house of mourning; do not go to weep nor bemoan them. For I have taken away My peace from this people, says Jehovah, even lovingkindness and mercies.

6. Both the great and the small shall die in this land. They shall not be buried, nor shall men mourn for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them.

7. Nor shall anyone break bread for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead. Nor shall anyone give them the cup of comfort to drink for their father or for their mother.

8. Also you shall not go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.

9. For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will cause the voice of mirth to cease out of this place before your eyes, and in your days, and the voice of gladness, and the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.

10. And it shall be, when you proclaim to this people all these words, and they shall say to you, Why has Jehovah pronounced all this great evil against us? Or what is our iniquity, or what is our sin that we have sinned against Jehovah our God?

11. Then you shall say to them, Because your fathers have forsaken Me, says Jehovah, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have bowed down to them, and have forsaken Me, and have not kept My Law.

12. And you have done worse than your fathers; for behold, you walk, each one, after the stubbornness of his evil heart, and do not listen to Me.

13. Therefore I will cast you out of this land into a land that you do not know, neither you nor your fathers; and there you shall serve other gods day and night; where I will not grant you favor.

14. Therefore behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that it shall no more be said, As Jehovah lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;

15. but rather, As Jehovah lives, who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands where He had driven them. For I will bring them back into their land that I gave to their fathers.

16. Behold, I will send for many fishermen, says Jehovah, and they will fish for them. And afterwards I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them from every mountain and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.

17. For My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from My face, nor is their iniquity hidden from My eyes.

18. And first I will repay double their iniquity and their sin, because they have defiled My land, they have filled My inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable things.

19. O Jehovah, my strength and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the nations shall come to You from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.

20. Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?

21. Therefore behold, this once I will make them know; I will cause them to know My hand and My might; and they shall know that My name is Jehovah.

## Jeremiah 17

1. The sin of Judah is written with an iron stylus; it is engraved on the tablet of the heart and on the horns of Your altar with the point of a diamond;

2. while their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees on the high hills.

3. O My mountain in the field, I will give your wealth and all your treasures for plunder, and your high places for sin, throughout all your borders.

4. And you, even yourself, have let go of the inheritance which I gave you; and I will cause you to serve your enemies in a land which you do not know. For you have kindled a fire in My anger, which shall burn forever.

5. Thus says Jehovah, Cursed is the man who trusts in man, and makes flesh his strength, and whose heart departs from Jehovah.

6. For he shall be destitute in the wilderness, and shall not see when good comes. But he shall live in the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land that is not inhabited.

7. Blessed is the man who trusts in Jehovah, and Jehovah is his refuge.

8. For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters; it sends out its roots by the river, and it shall not fear when the heat comes, but its foliage shall be green; and he is not anxious in the year of drought, nor will it cease from yielding fruit.

9. The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?

10. I Jehovah search the heart, I examine the soul, even to give to each man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his doings.

11. The partridge sets on eggs and does not hatch them; in the same way he who gets riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the middle of his days, and at his end he shall be a fool.

12. A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary.

13. O Jehovah, the Hope of Israel, all who forsake You shall be ashamed. Those who depart from Me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken Jehovah, the Fountain of Living Waters.

14. Heal me, O Jehovah, and I shall be healed, save me, and I shall be saved; for You are my praise.

15. Behold, they say to me, Where is the Word of Jehovah? Let it come now!

16. As for me, I have not hurried away from being a shepherd who follows You; nor have I desired the woeful day; You surely know the going forth of my lips before Your face.

17. Do not be a terror to me; You are my hope in the day of evil.

18. Let those who persecute me be ashamed, but do not let me be put to shame; let them be dismayed, but do not let me be dismayed. Bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.

19. Thus Jehovah said unto me: Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, by which the kings of Judah come in, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;

20. and say to them, Hear the Word of Jehovah, you kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who enter by these gates!

21. Thus says Jehovah, Take heed to yourselves, and carry no burden on the Sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem.

22. Nor carry out a burden from your houses on the Sabbath day, nor do any work, but consecrate the Sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.

23. But they did not obey, nor extend their ear, but made their neck stiff, so that they might not hear nor receive instruction.

24. And it shall be, if you listen and give heed to Me, says Jehovah, to bring no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but consecrate the Sabbath day, to do no work in it;

25. then kings and rulers sitting on the throne of David shall enter the gates of this city, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their rulers, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And this city shall remain forever.

26. And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places around Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the valleys, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and grain offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise to the house of Jehovah.

27. But if you will not listen to me to consecrate the Sabbath day, to not carry a burden when entering at the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.

## Jeremiah 18

1. The Word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,

2. Arise and go down to the potters house, and there I will cause you to hear My Words.

3. Then I went down to the potters house, and, behold, he was fashioning an object on the wheel.

4. And the vessel that he made of clay was ruined in the hand of the potter; so he made it again into another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.

5. Then the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

6. O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter? says Jehovah. Behold, as the clay is in the potters hands, so are you in My hand, O house of Israel.

7. The instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck it up; or to pull it down, and to destroy it;

8. if that nation, against whom I have spoken, will turn from their evil, I will be moved with compassion regarding the evil that I thought to do to them.

9. And the instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and plant it;

10. if it does evil in My eyes, so that it does not obey My voice, then I will regret the good by which I said I would do good to them.

11. Now then, go speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I am forming evil against you, and devising a plan against you. Return now, each one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.

12. And they said, There is no hope; but we will walk after our own thoughts, and we will each one do according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.

13. Therefore thus says Jehovah, Ask now among the nations; who has heard the likes of this? The virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing.

14. Does the snow of Lebanon avoid the rock of the field? Or shall the cold flowing waters be forsaken for that which comes from another place?

15. Because My people have forgotten Me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused themselves to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in byways, and not in the highway,

16. to make their land desolate and a perpetual hissing. Everyone who passes by will be appalled, and will wag his head.

17. I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.

18. Then they said, Come and let us devise schemes against Jeremiah. For the Law shall not perish from the priest, nor wisdom from the wise, nor the Word from the prophet. Come and let us strike him with the tongue, and let us not pay attention to any of his words.

19. Give attention to me; O Jehovah, and hear the voice of those who contend with me.

20. Should evil be repaid for good? For they have dug a pit for my life. Remember that I stood before You to speak good for them, to turn away Your wrath from them.

21. Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their blood by the hand of the sword. Let their wives be bereaved, and become widows. Let their men be slain to death, and their young men struck by the sword in battle.

22. Let a cry be heard from their houses, when You suddenly bring a troop upon them. For they have dug a pit to take me, and have hidden snares for my feet.

23. Yet, Jehovah, You know all their counsel against me to kill me. Do not forgive their iniquity, nor blot out their sin from Your sight, but let them be overthrown before You; deal with them in the time of Your anger.

## Jeremiah 19

1. Thus says Jehovah, Go and get a potters earthen jar, and assemble some of the elders of the people and of the elders of the priests.

2. And go out to the valley of the son of Hinnom which is by the entry of Potsherd Gate. And there proclaim the words that I shall tell you.

3. And say, Hear the Word of Jehovah, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, which shall cause the ears of him who hears it to tingle,

4. because they have forsaken Me, and have given regard to this place and have burned incense in it to other gods whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents.

5. They have also built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings to Baal, which I never commanded nor spoke, nor did it even come into My mind.

6. Therefore behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but The Valley of Slaughter.

7. And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of those who seek their lives. And I will give their corpses as food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth.

8. And I will make this city a desolation and a hissing. Everyone who passes by shall be amazed and shall hiss because of all its plagues.

9. And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall each one eat the flesh of his friend in the siege and distress with which their enemies and those who seek their lives shall distress them.

10. Then you shall break the jar before the eyes of the men who go with you,

11. and shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, Even so I will break this people and this city, as one breaks a potters vessel, that cannot be made whole again. And they shall bury them in Tophet until there is no place left to bury.

12. I will do this to this place, says Jehovah, and to its inhabitants, and make this city as Tophet.

13. And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah shall be as defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of the heavens, and have poured out drink offerings to other gods.

14. Then Jeremiah came from Tophet, where Jehovah had sent him to prophesy. And he stood in the court of Jehovahs house, and said to all the people,

15. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring on this city and on all its towns all the evil that I have spoken against it, because they have hardened their necks so that they might not hear My Words.

## Jeremiah 20

1. Now Pashur, the son of Immer the priest (he was chief officer in the house of Jehovah), heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.

2. Then Pashur struck Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper Gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of Jehovah.

3. And it happened on the next day that Pashur brought Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, Jehovah has not called your name Pashur, but Magor-Missabib.

4. For thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. And they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes shall see it. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and kill them with the sword.

5. And I will give all the wealth of this city, and its produce, and all its precious things, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies; who will plunder them and take them, and bring them to Babylon.

6. And you, Pashur, and all who dwell in your house, shall go into captivity. And you shall go to Babylon, and you shall die there, and shall be buried there; you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied lies.

7. O Jehovah, You have deceived me, and I was deceived. You are stronger than I, and You have prevailed. I am in derision all the day; everyone mocks me.

8. For whenever I speak, I cry out, I cry violence and devastation; for the Word of Jehovah has been a reproach and a derision to me all the day.

9. Then I said, I will not make mention of Him, nor speak in His name any more. But His Word was in my heart like a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with holding it in, and I could not.

10. For I have heard the whisperings of many, terror is all around. Proclaim, they say, and we will report it. Everyone at peace with me is watching for me to stumble and fall, saying, Perhaps he will be lured away, and we shall prevail against him, and shall take our revenge on him.

11. But Jehovah is with me like a mighty, awesome one. Therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail. They shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not succeed. Their everlasting reproach shall never be forgotten.

12. But, O Jehovah of Hosts, who tries the righteous and sees the soul and the heart, let me see Your vengeance on them. For I have made my cause known to You.

13. Sing to Jehovah! Praise Jehovah! For He has delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.

14. Cursed be the day in which I was born; let not the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.

15. Cursed be the man who brought news to my father, saying, A male child has been born to you; making him very glad.

16. And let that man be as the cities which Jehovah overthrew without compassion; and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noon;

17. because he did not kill me from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb always pregnant.

18. Why did I come forth from the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?

## Jeremiah 21

1. The Word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,

2. Please inquire of Jehovah for us, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is warring against us. Perhaps Jehovah will deal with us according to all His wonderful works, that he may depart from us.

3. Then Jeremiah said to them, Thus you shall say to Zedekiah,

4. Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which you fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans who besiege you outside the walls. And I will gather them together in the middle of this city.

5. And I Myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.

6. And I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast. They shall die of a great pestilence.

7. And afterward, says Jehovah, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and those who are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life. And he shall strike them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, nor have pity, nor have mercy.

8. And to this people you shall say, Thus says Jehovah, Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.

9. He who remains in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence. But he who goes out and prostrates himself to the Chaldeans who besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be his prize.

10. For I have set My face against this city for evil, and not for good, says Jehovah. It shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.

11. And concerning the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear the Word of Jehovah.

12. O house of David, thus says Jehovah: Execute justice in the morning, and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor, lest My fury go forth like fire, and burn so that no one can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.

13. Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley, rock of the plain, says Jehovah; who say, Who shall come down against us? Or who shall enter into our dwellings?

14. But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, says Jehovah; and I will kindle a fire in its forest, and it shall devour all things around it.

## Jeremiah 22

1. Thus says Jehovah: Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak this Word there,

2. and say, Hear the Word of Jehovah, O king of Judah, who sits on the throne of David, you and your servants, and your people who enter in by these gates.

3. Thus says Jehovah, Execute justice and righteousness, and deliver him who is plundered out of the hand of the oppressor. And do no wrong, do no violence to the sojourner, the fatherless, or the widow, nor shed innocent blood in this place.

4. For if indeed you do this thing, then there shall enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, his servants, and his people.

5. But if you will not heed these Words, I swear by Myself, says Jehovah, that this house shall become a desolation.

6. For thus says Jehovah to the house of the king of Judah, You are Gilead to Me, the head of Lebanon. Yet surely I will make you a wilderness; cities which are not inhabited.

7. And I will prepare destroyers against you, each one with his weapons. And they shall cut down your choice cedars, and throw them into the fire.

8. And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say each one to his neighbor, Why has Jehovah done this to this great city?

9. Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of Jehovah their God, and bowed down to other gods, and served them.

10. Weep not for the dead, nor moan for him; but weep bitterly for him who goes away. For he shall return no more, nor see his native land.

11. For thus says Jehovah concerning Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, who reigned in the place of Josiah his father, who went forth out of this place: he shall not return there any more.

12. But he shall die in the place where they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more.

13. Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness and his upper rooms without justice; his neighbor serves without pay, and is given nothing for his work;

14. who says, I will build myself a wide house and large rooms, and has cut out windows for himself, and the ceiling is paneled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.

15. Shall you reign, because you lust after cedar? Did not your father eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness? Then it was well with him.

16. He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him. Was this not knowledge of Me? says Jehovah.

17. But your eyes and your heart are for nothing but your unjust gain, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and to do violence.

18. Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, They shall not mourn for him, saying, Alas, my brother! or, Alas, sister! They shall not mourn for him, saying, Alas, master! or, Alas, his majesty!

19. He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, dragged and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.

20. Go up to Lebanon, and cry out; and lift up your voice in Bashan, and cry out from Abarim, for all your lovers are destroyed.

21. I spoke to you in your prosperity; but you said, I will not hear. This has been your way from your youth, for you have not obeyed My voice.

22. The wind shall eat up all your shepherds, and your lovers shall go into captivity; surely then you will be ashamed and humiliated for all your wickedness.

23. O inhabitant of Lebanon, nesting in the cedars, how you will be pitied when pangs come upon you, the pain as of a woman giving birth!

24. As I live, says Jehovah, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet on My right hand, yet I would tear you out of there!

25. And I will give you into the hand of those who seek your life, and into the hand of those whose face you fear, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.

26. And I will cast you out, along with your mother who bore you, into another land where you were not born; and there you shall die.

27. But to the land to which they desire to return, there they shall not return.

28. Is this man Coniah a despised and broken vessel? Is he an object in which there is no pleasure? Why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they do not know?

29. O earth, earth, earth, hear the Word of Jehovah!

30. Thus says Jehovah, Write this man down as childless, a man who shall not prosper in his days; for no man of his seed shall succeed, sitting on the throne of David and ruling any more in Judah.

## Jeremiah 23

1. Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of My pasture! says Jehovah.

2. Therefore thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, against the shepherds who feed My people, You have scattered My flock, and have driven them away, and have not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for the evil of your doings, says Jehovah.

3. And I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all the lands where I have driven them, and will bring them back to their folds. And they shall be fruitful and multiply.

4. And I will set up shepherds over them who will feed them. And they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed; nor shall they be lacking, says Jehovah.

5. Behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King who shall reign and act prudently, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the earth.

6. In His days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely. And this is His name by which He shall be called, JEHOVAH, OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.

7. Therefore, behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that they shall no longer say, Jehovah lives, who brought the sons of Israel up out of the land of Egypt;

8. but, Jehovah lives, who brought up and led the seed of the house of Israel out of the land of the north, and from all lands where I have driven them. And they shall dwell in their own land.

9. My heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake. I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine has overcome, because of Jehovah, and because of the Words of His holiness.

10. For the land is full of adulterers. Yes, because of cursing the land mourns; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their strength is not right.

11. For both prophet and priest are corrupt; yes, in My house I have found their evil, says Jehovah.

12. So their way shall be to them as slippery ways in the darkness; they shall be driven on, and fall in them; for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their punishment, says Jehovah.

13. And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal and caused My people Israel to go astray.

14. I have also seen in the prophets of Jerusalem a horrible thing; they commit adultery and walk in falsehood. They also strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns back from his evil; they are all of them like Sodom to Me, and its inhabitants like Gomorrah.

15. Therefore thus says Jehovah of Hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them wormwood, and make them drink bitter water; for godlessness has gone forth from the prophets of Jerusalem into all the land.

16. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They fill you with vanities; they speak a vision from their own heart, not out of the mouth of Jehovah.

17. They speak to those who despise Me, promising, Jehovah has said, You shall have peace! And they say to everyone who walks after the stubbornness of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you!

18. For who has stood in the counsel of Jehovah, and has perceived and heard His Word? Who has paid attention to His Word and heeded it?

19. Behold, a tempest from Jehovah has gone forth in fury, a whirling tempest. It shall whirl upon the head of the wicked.

20. The anger of Jehovah shall not turn back, until He has executed and until He has fulfilled the purposes of His heart; in the latter days you shall diligently consider it with understanding.

21. I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran; I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.

22. But if they had stood in My counsel and had caused My people to hear My Words, then they would have turned them from their evil way and from the evil of their doings.

23. Am I a God near by, says Jehovah, and not a God afar off?

24. Can anyone hide himself in secret places so that I shall not see him? says Jehovah. Do I not fill the heavens and earth? says Jehovah.

25. I have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy lies in My name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.

26. How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies? Indeed, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart,

27. who think to cause My people to forget My name by their dreams which they tell, each one to his neighbor, as their fathers have forgotten My name for Baal.

28. The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream. And he who has My Word, let him speak My Word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? says Jehovah.

29. Is not My Word like a fire? says Jehovah; and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?

30. Therefore thus says Jehovah, Behold, I am against the prophets who steal My Words each one from his neighbor.

31. Jehovah says, Behold, I am against the prophets who use their tongues and say, He says.

32. Jehovah says, Behold, I am against those who prophesy false dreams and tell them, and cause My people to go astray by their lies and by their foolishness. Yet I did not send them nor command them; therefore they shall not profit this people at all, says Jehovah.

33. And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask you, saying, What is the burden of Jehovah? You shall then say to them, What burden? I will even forsake you, says Jehovah.

34. And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, who shall say, The burden of Jehovah! I will even punish that man and his house.

35. And you shall say each one to his neighbor, and each one to his brother, What has Jehovah answered? and, What has Jehovah spoken?

36. And you shall mention the burden of Jehovah no more. For every mans word shall be his burden; for you have perverted the Words of the living God, of Jehovah of Hosts our God.

37. Thus you shall say to the prophet, What has Jehovah answered you? and, What has Jehovah spoken?

38. But since you say, The burden of Jehovah! therefore thus says Jehovah, Because you say this word (The burden of Jehovah), and I have sent to you saying, You shall not say, The burden of Jehovah;

39. therefore behold, I, even I, will completely forget you, and I will forsake you and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and will cast you out of My presence.

40. And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.

## Jeremiah 24

1. Jehovah caused me to see, and behold, two baskets of figs set before the temple of Jehovah (after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the rulers of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon);

2. one basket had very good figs, like the first ripe figs. And the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.

3. Then Jehovah said to me, What do you see, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs are very good, and the bad are very bad, so that they cannot be eaten, they are so bad.

4. Again the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

5. Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so I will acknowledge the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for good.

6. For I will set My eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land. And I will build them and not pull them down; and I will plant them and not pluck them up.

7. And I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am Jehovah; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God. For they shall return to Me with their whole heart.

8. And like the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad; surely thus says Jehovah, Thus I will give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his rulers, and the rest of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt;

9. and I will deliver them over in horror into all the kingdoms of the earth for evil, for a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, there in all the places where I shall drive them.

10. And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence among them, until they are destroyed from the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.

## Jeremiah 25

1. The Word that came unto Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (It was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon);

2. which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,

3. From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even to this day, which is the twenty-third year, the Word of Jehovah has come unto me; and I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking; but you have not listened.

4. And Jehovah has sent to you all His servants the prophets, rising early and sending them; but you have not listened nor extended your ear to hear.

5. They said, Turn back now, each one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that Jehovah has given to you and to your fathers forever and ever.

6. And do not go after other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no harm.

7. Yet you have not listened to Me, says Jehovah, so that you might provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands, to your own hurt.

8. Therefore thus says Jehovah of Hosts, Because you have not given heed to My Words,

9. behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, says Jehovah, and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and will bring them against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations all around. And I will completely destroy them, and make them a waste, and a hissing, and perpetual ruins.

10. And I will take from them the voice of rejoicing and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp.

11. And this whole land shall be a ruin and a waste. And these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.

12. And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are fulfilled, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, and the land of the Chaldeans for their iniquity, says Jehovah; and I will make it a perpetual desolation.

13. And I will bring on that land all My Words which I have spoken against it, all that is written in this book which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.

14. For many nations and great kings shall lay service upon them also. And I will repay them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.

15. For thus says Jehovah the God of Israel to me, Take the wine cup of this wrath from My hand, and cause all the nations to whom I send you to drink it.

16. And they shall drink, and reel to and fro, and go mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.

17. Then I took the cup from Jehovahs hand, and made all the nations drink, to whom Jehovah had sent me;

18. Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, their kings and their rulers, to make them a desolation, a horror, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day;

19. Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and his servants, his rulers, and all his people;

20. and all the people mixed together, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the rest of Ashdod;

21. Edom, and Moab, and the sons of Ammon;

22. and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon; and the kings of the coastlands beyond the sea,

23. Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and those who are cut off at the remotest regions;

24. and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the people mixed together who dwell in the desert;

25. and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;

26. and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world which are on the face of the earth. And the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.

27. Therefore you shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Drink and be drunk, and vomit, and fall and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.

28. And it shall be, that if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, You shall certainly drink.

29. For, lo, I am beginning to bring evil on the city which is called by My name; and should you be found clean and free from guilt? You shall not be without guilt, for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, says Jehovah of Hosts.

30. Therefore prophesy against them all these Words, and say to them, Jehovah shall roar from on high, and utter His voice from His holy habitation. He shall mightily roar over His dwelling place. He shall give a shout, like those who tread out grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.

31. A roaring noise shall come to the ends of the earth; for Jehovah has a controversy with the nations; He will enter into judgment with all flesh. He will give those who are wicked to the sword, says Jehovah.

32. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great tempest shall be roused up from the recesses of the earth.

33. And in that day the slain of Jehovah shall be from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth. They shall not be mourned, nor gathered, nor buried. They shall be as dung on the ground.

34. Howl, you shepherds, and cry! Wallow in the ashes, you majestic ones of the flock! For the days of your slaughter and of your scattering are fulfilled; and you shall fall like a delightful vessel.

35. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the majestic ones of the flock to escape.

36. A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and a howling of the majestic ones of the flock shall be heard; for Jehovah has spoiled their pasture,

37. and the peaceful pastures are cut down because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.

38. He has left His den like a lion; for their land is wasted at the presence of His fierce violence, and before His fierce anger.

## Jeremiah 26

1. In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this Word came from Jehovah, saying,

2. Thus says Jehovah: Stand in the court of Jehovahs house and speak to all the cities of Judah, which come to bow down in Jehovahs house, all the Words that I command you to speak to them; do not diminish a word.

3. It may be that they will listen, and each man turn from his evil way, that I may be moved to compassion from the evil which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings.

4. And you shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah: If you will not listen to Me, to walk in My Law which I have set before you,

5. to listen to the words of My servants the prophets whom I sent to you, both rising up early and sending them (but you have not listened);

6. then I will make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.

7. So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Jehovah.

8. And it happened when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that Jehovah had commanded him to speak to all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, You shall die the death!

9. Why have you prophesied in the name of Jehovah, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be wasted, without inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah.

10. When the rulers of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the kings house to the house of Jehovah, and sat down in the entrance of the New Gate of Jehovahs house.

11. And the priests and the prophets spoke to the rulers and to all the people, saying, Sentence this man to death, for he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.

12. Then Jeremiah spoke to all the rulers and to all the people, saying, Jehovah sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.

13. Now therefore, make your ways and your doings good, and obey the voice of Jehovah your God. And Jehovah will show compassion regarding the evil that He has spoken against you.

14. As for me, behold, I am in your hand. Do with me as seems good and right to you.

15. But know for certain that if you put me to death, you shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon its inhabitants; for truly Jehovah has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.

16. Then the rulers and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets, This man is not worthy of death; for he has spoken to us in the name of Jehovah our God.

17. Then some of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,

18. Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps of ruins, and the mountain of the house like the high places of a forest.

19. Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah execute him to death? Did he not fear Jehovah, and entreat Jehovah, and Jehovah had compassion regarding the evil which He had spoken against them? So we are doing great evil against our souls.

20. And there was also a man who prophesied in the name of Jehovah, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath Jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.

21. And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men and all the rulers, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death. But when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled and went into Egypt.

22. And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt; Elnathan the son of Achbor, and men with him into Egypt.

23. And they brought Urijah out of Egypt and brought him to Jehoiakim the king, who killed him with the sword and threw his dead body into the graves of the common people.

24. But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.

## Jeremiah 27

1. In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, this Word came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,

2. Thus says Jehovah to me, Make bonds and yokes for yourself, and put them on your neck,

3. and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.

4. And command them to go to their masters, saying, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Thus you shall say to your masters,

5. I have made the earth, man, and the animals on the face of the earth, by My great power and by My outstretched arm, and have given it to whom it seemed right to Me.

6. And now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant. And I have also given him the beasts of the field to serve him.

7. And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his sons son, until the time of his land comes. And then many nations and great kings shall make him serve them.

8. And it shall be, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation I will punish, says Jehovah, with the sword and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.

9. Therefore, do not listen to your prophets, nor to your fortune tellers, nor to your dreamers, nor to your conjurers, nor to your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, You shall not serve the king of Babylon.

10. For they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land, and that I should drive you out and you should perish.

11. But the nations who bring their necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, those I will let remain on their own land, says Jehovah. And they shall work it and dwell in it.

12. I also spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.

13. Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as Jehovah has spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?

14. Therefore do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, You shall not serve the king of Babylon. For they prophesy a lie to you.

15. For I have not sent them, says Jehovah; yet they prophesy a lie in My name, so that I might drive you out, and that you might perish, you and the prophets who prophesy to you.

16. Also I spoke to the priests and to all the people, saying, Thus says Jehovah, Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of Jehovahs house shall now shortly be brought back from Babylon; for they prophesy a lie to you.

17. Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon and live. For why should this city be laid waste?

18. But if they are prophets, and if the Word of Jehovah is with them, let them now make entreaties to Jehovah of Hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, may not go to Babylon.

19. For thus says Jehovah of Hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the rest of the vessels which remain in this city,

20. which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;

21. yes, thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of Jehovah and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem:

22. They shall be carried to Babylon, and they shall be there until the day that I visit them, says Jehovah. Then I will bring them up and restore them to this place.

## Jeremiah 28

1. And it happened in the same year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur, the prophet of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of Jehovah in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,

2. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.

3. Within two full years I will bring back into this place all the vessels of Jehovahs house, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried them to Babylon.

4. And I will bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah who went into Babylon, says Jehovah; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.

5. Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of Jehovah,

6. even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen. May Jehovah do so. May Jehovah establish your words which you have prophesied, to bring back the vessels of Jehovahs house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.

7. But hear now this word that I speak in your ears and in the ears of all the people:

8. The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many lands and against great kingdoms; of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.

9. As for the prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then the prophet shall be known, that Jehovah has truly sent him.

10. Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiahs neck and broke it.

11. And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus says Jehovah, Even so I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the time frame of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.

12. Then the Word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off of the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,

13. Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus says Jehovah: You have broken the yokes of wood, but you have made in their place yokes of iron.

14. For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. And they shall serve him. And I have given him the beasts of the field also.

15. Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah: Jehovah has not sent you, but you make this people to trust in a lie.

16. Therefore thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will drive you from off the face of the earth. You shall die this year, because you have taught rebellion against Jehovah.

17. So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.

## Jeremiah 29

1. And these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the rest of the elders of the captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar took captive from Jerusalem to Babylon.

2. (After Jeconiah the king, and the queen mother, and the officials, the rulers of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the smiths, had departed from Jerusalem.)

3. The letter came by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah the king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, saying,

4. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, to all the captives whom I caused to be taken captive from Jerusalem to Babylon:

5. Build houses and live in them; and plant gardens and eat their fruit.

6. Take wives and beget sons and daughters. And take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, so that they may bear sons and daughters, that you may be multiplied there and not diminished.

7. And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be exiled, and pray to Jehovah for it. For in its peace you shall have peace.

8. For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Do not let your prophets and your fortune-tellers in your midst deceive you, nor listen to your dreams which you dream.

9. For they prophesy falsely to you in My name; I have not sent them, says Jehovah.

10. For thus says Jehovah, When according to My Word seventy years have been fulfilled at Babylon, I will visit you and carry out My good Word to you, to bring you back to this place.

11. For I know the thoughts which I am planning for you, says Jehovah; thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope.

12. Then you shall call on Me, and you shall go and pray to Me, and I will listen to you.

13. And you shall seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart.

14. And I will be found by you, says Jehovah; and I will bring you back from your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places where I have driven you, says Jehovah. And I will bring you back into the place from where I caused you to be taken captive.

15. Because you have said, Jehovah has raised up prophets for us in Babylon;

16. thus says Jehovah concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, and concerning your brothers who have not gone out with you into captivity;

17. thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Behold, I will send on them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like overripe figs which cannot be eaten, they are so bad.

18. And I will pursue them with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, and will make them objects of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and a waste, and a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them,

19. because they have not heeded My Words, says Jehovah, which I sent to them by My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but you would not obey, says Jehovah.

20. Therefore hear the Word of Jehovah, all you exiles, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon;

21. thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in My name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall kill them before your eyes.

22. And a curse shall be taken up about them by all the captives of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, May Jehovah make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,

23. because they have done disgraceful things in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors wives, and have spoken lying words in My name, which I have not commanded them; for I am He who knows and is a witness, says Jehovah.

24. You shall also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,

25. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because you have sent letters in your name to all the people who are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,

26. Jehovah has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to be officers in the house of Jehovah over every madman who prophesies, that you should put him in prison and in the stocks.

27. Now therefore why have you not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, who prophesies to you?

28. For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long. Build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their fruit.

29. And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.

30. And the Word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,

31. Send to all the captives, saying, Thus says Jehovah concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I have not sent him, and he caused you to trust in a lie,

32. therefore thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his seed. He shall not have a man to dwell among this people; nor shall he behold the good which I shall do for My people, says Jehovah, because he has taught rebellion against Jehovah.

## Jeremiah 30

1. The Word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,

2. Thus speaks Jehovah the God of Israel, saying, Write all the Words that I have spoken to you in a book.

3. For, lo, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will bring back the captives of My people Israel and Judah, says Jehovah. And I will cause them to return to the land that I gave their fathers, and they shall possess it.

4. And these are the Words that Jehovah spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.

5. For thus says Jehovah, We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.

6. Ask now, and see whether a man ever gives birth? Why do I see every man with his hands on his loins, like a woman in labor, and all faces are turned pale?

7. Alas! For that day is great, so that none is like it; it is even the time of Jacobs trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.

8. For it shall come to pass in that day, says Jehovah of Hosts, that I will break his yoke from your neck and will burst your bonds. And strangers shall no longer enslave him,

9. but they shall serve Jehovah their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.

10. Therefore, do not fear, O My servant Jacob, says Jehovah. Do not be dismayed, O Israel. For lo, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity. And Jacob shall return, and shall be at rest, and be quiet, and no one shall make him afraid.

11. For I am with you, says Jehovah, to save you. Though I make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you, yet I will not make a complete end of you; but I will correct you in justice, and will not acquit nor leave you unpunished.

12. For thus says Jehovah, Your break is incurable, and your wound is making you sick.

13. There is no one to plead your cause; for your wounds there are no healing medicines.

14. All your lovers have forgotten you; they do not seek you. For I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the abundance of your iniquity, because your sins are many.

15. Why do you cry over your break? Your pain is incurable, because of the abundance of your iniquities; because your sins have increased, I have done these things to you.

16. Therefore all those who devour you shall be devoured; and all your adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity. And those who plunder you shall become plunder, and all who prey upon you I will give as prey.

17. For I will stir up health to you, and will heal you of your wounds, says Jehovah; because they called you an outcast, saying, This is Zion; no one seeks after her.

18. Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will bring back the captives of Jacobs tents, and will have mercy on his dwelling places. And the city shall be built on her own hill, and the palace shall remain in its own place.

19. And out of them shall come forth thanksgiving, and the voice of those who make merry. And I will multiply them, and they shall not diminish; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.

20. Their children shall also be as they were before, and their congregation shall be established before Me, and I will punish all who oppress them.

21. And their rulers shall be from among themselves, and their governor shall come from their midst; and I will cause him to be brought near, and he shall draw near to Me. For who is this who pledged his heart to come near to Me? says Jehovah.

22. And you shall be My people, and I will be your God.

23. Behold, the tempest of Jehovahs wrath goes forth, a roaring tempest; it shall whirl on the head of the wicked.

24. The fierce anger of Jehovah shall not return until He has done it, and until He has fulfilled the purposes of His heart. In the latter days you shall understand it.

## Jeremiah 31

1. At that time, says Jehovah, I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be My people.

2. Thus says Jehovah, The people who were survivors of the sword have found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I go to give him rest.

3. Jehovah has appeared to me from afar, saying, Yea, I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore with lovingkindness I have drawn you.

4. Again I will build you, and you shall be built, O virgin of Israel. You shall again put on your tambourines, and shall go forth in the dances of those who rejoice.

5. You shall yet plant vines on the mountains of Samaria; the planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common food.

6. For there shall be a day that the watchmen on Mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise and let us go up to Zion unto Jehovah our God!

7. For thus says Jehovah, Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations. Cry out, give praise and say, O Jehovah, save Your people, the remnant of Israel!

8. Behold, I will bring them from the land of the north and gather them from the recesses of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and she who is in labor with child, together; a great company shall return there.

9. They shall come with weeping, and with supplications I will lead them. I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way; they shall not stumble in it, for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is My firstborn.

10. Hear the Word of Jehovah, O nations, and declare it on distant shores; and say, He who scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him as a shepherd keeps his flock.

11. For Jehovah has redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of the one stronger than him.

12. Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of Jehovah, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and the herd. And their souls shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not languish any more at all.

13. Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and old together; for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them and make them rejoice from their sorrow.

14. And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and My people shall be satisfied with My goodness, says Jehovah.

15. Thus says Jehovah: A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted for her children, because they are not.

16. Thus says Jehovah: Refrain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears; for your work shall be rewarded, says Jehovah. And they shall come back from the land of the enemy.

17. And there is hope for your future, says Jehovah, that your children shall come back to their own territory.

18. I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself, saying, You have chastised me, and I was chastised, like an untrained bull; draw me back, and I shall return. For You are Jehovah my God.

19. Surely after I was turned back, I repented; and after I was instructed, I struck my thigh. I was ashamed, yes, even humiliated, because I bore the reproach of my youth.

20. Is Ephraim My dear son? Is he a delightful child? For as often as I spoke against him, I call to mind and remember him still. Therefore My heart is stirred for him; I will have mercy and compassion upon him, says Jehovah.

21. Set up signposts, make landmarks for yourself. Set your heart toward the highway, the way you went. Turn back, O virgin of Israel, turn back to these cities of yours.

22. How long will you vacillate, O backsliding daughter? For Jehovah has created a new thing in the earth; a woman shall contain a man.

23. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, They shall speak this word in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I shall bring back their captives, saying, Jehovah bless you, O habitation of justice and mountain of holiness.

24. And farmers, and those going forth with flocks, shall dwell together in Judah and in all its cities.

25. For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have satisfied every sorrowful soul.

26. After this I awoke and looked around; and my sleep was sweet to me.

27. Behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beasts.

28. And it shall come to pass that, as I have watched over them to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so I will watch over them to build and to plant, says Jehovah.

29. In those days they shall not say any more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the children are dull.

30. But every man shall die for his own iniquity. Every man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth shall be dull.

31. Behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah,

32. not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; My covenant which they broke, although I was a husband to them, says Jehovah.

33. But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel: After those days, says Jehovah, I will put My Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.

34. And they shall no more teach each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for they shall all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says Jehovah. For I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.

35. Thus says Jehovah, who gives the sun for a light by day and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirs up the sea when its waves roar (Jehovah of Hosts is His name);

36. if those ordinances depart from My presence, says Jehovah, then the seed of Israel shall also cease from being a nation before Me forever.

37. Thus says Jehovah, If the heavens above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth below can be searched out, then I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, says Jehovah.

38. Behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that the city shall be built to Jehovah from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.

39. And the measuring line shall come out to the hill Gareb, and shall go around to Goath.

40. And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields as far as the Kidron Valley, to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, shall be holy to Jehovah. It shall not be plucked up nor thrown down any more forever.

## Jeremiah 32

1. The Word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.

2. For then the army of the king of Babylon besieged Jerusalem. And Jeremiah the prophet was shut in the court of the guard, which was in the house of the king of Judah.

3. For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do you prophesy and say, Thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it,

4. and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall be given over and delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes,

5. and he shall lead Zedekiah into Babylon, and there he shall be until I visit him, says Jehovah; though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not succeed.

6. And Jeremiah said, The Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

7. Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle shall come to you, saying, Buy for yourself my field in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is yours, to buy it.

8. So Hanamel my uncles son came to me in the court of the guard according to the Word of Jehovah and said to me, Please buy my field in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is yours, and the right of redemption is yours. Buy it for yourself. Then I knew that this was the Word of Jehovah.

9. And I bought the field in Anathoth, from Hanamel my uncles son, and weighed him the money, seventeen shekels of silver.

10. And I wrote it in the document, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed the silver in the scales.

11. So I took the document of the purchase, that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and the open copy.

12. And I gave the document of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the eyes of Hanamel my uncles son, and in the eyes of the witnesses who wrote in the purchase document, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard.

13. And I charged Baruch before them, saying,

14. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Take these documents, the purchase document, the one sealed and the open document, and put them in an earthen vessel so that they may survive many days.

15. For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall be acquired again in this land.

16. And after I gave the purchase document to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to Jehovah, saying,

17. Ah, Lord Jehovah! You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too difficult for You.

18. You show lovingkindness to thousands, and repay the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their sons after them. The great, the strong and Mighty God, Jehovah of Hosts, is His name,

19. great in counsel and mighty in work; for Your eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings.

20. For You have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, and in Israel and among men; and have made Yourself a name, as it is this day;

21. and have brought forth Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders, and with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror.

22. And You have given them this land, which You swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.

23. And they came in and possessed it, but they have not obeyed Your voice, nor walked in Your Law. They have done nothing of all that You commanded them to do; therefore You have caused all this evil to come upon them.

24. Behold, the siege mounds have come to the city to take it; and the city has been given into the hands of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, the famine, and the pestilence. And what You have spoken has happened; and behold, there You see it.

25. And You have said to me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy the field for money, and take witnesses; yet the city has been given into the hands of the Chaldeans.

26. Then the Word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,

27. Behold, I am Jehovah the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for Me?

28. Therefore thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it.

29. And the Chaldeans who fight against this city shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke Me to anger.

30. For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only evil before Me from their youth. For the children of Israel have only provoked Me to anger with the work of their hands, says Jehovah.

31. For this city has been to Me a provocation of My anger and of My fury from the day that they built it, even to this day; that I should remove it from before My face,

32. because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me to anger; they, their kings, their rulers, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

33. And they have turned the back to Me, and not the face; though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction.

34. But they set their abominations in the house which is called by My name, to defile it.

35. And they built the high places of Baal, in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech; which I did not command them, nor did it even enter My mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.

36. And now therefore, thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:

37. Behold, I will gather them out of all the lands where I have driven them in My anger, and in My fury, and in great wrath. And I will bring them back to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely.

38. And they shall be My people, and I will be their God.

39. And I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me forever, for their good and for the good of their children after them.

40. And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good. But I will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me.

41. Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will truly plant them in this land, with all My heart and all My soul.

42. For thus says Jehovah: Just as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so I will bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.

43. And fields shall be bought in this land of which you say, It is desolate, without man or beast; it has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.

44. Men shall buy fields for money, and write it in a document, and seal it, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south. For I will cause their captives to return, says Jehovah.

## Jeremiah 33

1. And the Word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was still shut up in the court of the guard, saying,

2. Thus says Jehovah the Maker, Jehovah who formed it in order to establish it; Jehovah is His name:

3. Call unto Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and unfathomable things which you do not know.

4. For thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down to fortify against the siege mounds and the sword:

5. They come to fight with the Chaldeans, only to fill them with the dead bodies of the men whom I have slain in My anger and in My fury, for all whose evil I have hidden My face from this city.

6. Behold, I will bring it health and healing, and I will heal them and will show them the abundance of peace and truth.

7. And I will cause the captives of Judah and the captives of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.

8. And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against Me; and I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned, and by which they have transgressed against Me.

9. And it shall be to Me a name of joy, a praise and an honor before all the nations of the earth, who shall hear all the good that I do to them. And they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the welfare that I am bringing to it.

10. Thus says Jehovah: Again there shall be heard in this place, which you say is desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast;

11. the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who shall say, Praise Jehovah of Hosts, for Jehovah is good, for His mercy is eternal; and the voice of those who shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of Jehovah. For I will cause the captives of the land to return, as at the first, says Jehovah.

12. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Again in this place which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all its cities, there shall be a dwelling place of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.

13. In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him who counts them, says Jehovah.

14. Behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will establish the good thing which I have promised to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.

15. In those days, and at that time, I will cause the Branch of Righteousness to grow up to David; and He shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.

16. In those days Judah shall be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely. And this is the name by which she shall be called: JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.

17. For thus says Jehovah, David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,

18. nor shall the priests, the Levites, lack a man before Me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle grain offerings, and to sacrifice continually.

19. And the Word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,

20. Thus says Jehovah: If you can break My covenant of the day and My covenant of the night, so that there should not be day and night in their season,

21. then also may My covenant with David My servant be broken, that he should not have a son to reign on his throne, and with the Levites the priests, My ministers.

22. As the host of the heavens cannot be numbered, nor the sand of the sea measured, so I will multiply the seed of David My servant and the Levites who serve Me.

23. Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,

24. Do you not consider what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which Jehovah has chosen, He has even cast them off? Thus they have despised My people, that they should no more be a nation before them.

25. Thus says Jehovah: If My covenant is not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of the heavens and the earth,

26. then I will cast away the seed of Jacob, and David My servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will bring back their captives, and have mercy on them.

## Jeremiah 34

1. The Word which came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion, and all the peoples, fought against Jerusalem and against all its cities; saying,

2. Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him, Thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.

3. And you shall not escape out of his hand, but shall surely be captured and delivered into his hand. And your eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with you mouth to mouth, and you shall go to Babylon.

4. Yet hear the Word of Jehovah, O Zedekiah king of Judah, thus says Jehovah concerning you: You shall not die by the sword.

5. You shall die in peace; and as the burnings of incense for your fathers, the former kings which were before you, so they shall burn incense for you. And they shall lament for you, saying, Ah, lord! For I have spoken the Word, says Jehovah.

6. Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,

7. when the king of Babylons army fought against Jerusalem and against all the remaining cities of Judah; against Lachish, and against Azekah; for these fortified cities remained of the cities of Judah.

8. The Word that came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;

9. that each man should let his male slave, and each man his female slave, if they were a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, to go free; that no one should keep a Jewish brother enslaved.

10. And all the rulers obeyed, and all the people who had entered into the covenant allowed them to go free, each man his male slave, and each man his female slave, so that no one should be enslaved among them any more; and they obeyed and let them go.

11. But afterward they changed their minds and caused the slaves and slave women whom they had let go free, to return! And they subjected them as slaves and slave women.

12. Therefore the Word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,

13. Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, saying,

14. At the end of seven years let each man free his brother, a Hebrew, who has been sold to him. And when he has served you six years, you shall let him go free from you. But your fathers did not heed me, nor extend their ears.

15. And you had turned today, and had done what was right in My eyes proclaiming liberty, each man to his neighbor. And you had made a covenant before Me in the house which is called by My name.

16. But you turned and violated My name, and each man caused his slave, and each man his slave woman, whom you had set free to do as they pleased, to return. And you brought them back into bondage to be slaves and slave women to you.

17. Therefore thus says Jehovah: You have not heeded Me to proclaim liberty each man to his brother, and each man to his neighbor! Behold, I proclaim liberty for you, says Jehovah, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine. And I will cause you to be an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.

18. And I will give the men who have transgressed My covenant, who have not done the words of the covenant which they made before Me when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts;

19. the rulers of Judah, and the rulers of Jerusalem, the officials, and the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf;

20. I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life. And their dead bodies shall be for food to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the earth.

21. And I will give Zedekiah king of Judah, and his rulers, into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylons army, who have withdrawn from you.

22. Behold, I will command, says Jehovah, and cause them to return to this city. And they shall fight against it and capture it, and burn it with fire. And I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.

## Jeremiah 35

1. The Word which came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,

2. Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak to them, and bring them into the house of Jehovah, into one of the rooms, and give them wine to drink.

3. Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites.

4. And I brought them into the house of Jehovah, into the room of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was near the room of the rulers, above the room of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door.

5. And I set pots full of wine, and cups, before the sons of the house of the Rechabites. And I said to them, Drink wine!

6. But they said, We will drink no wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, You shall drink no wine, you nor your sons forever.

7. Nor shall you build houses, nor sow seed, nor plant a vineyard, nor have any of these; but all your days you shall live in tents, so that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn.

8. So we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he has commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;

9. nor to build houses for us to live in. Nor do we have vineyard, nor field, nor seed.

10. But we have lived in tents, and have obeyed and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.

11. But it came to pass when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of Syria. So we are living at Jerusalem.

12. Then came the Word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,

13. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will you not receive instruction to heed My Words? says Jehovah.

14. The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, which he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are done. For to this day they do not drink, but obey their fathers commandment. But I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking, but you have not heeded Me.

15. I have also sent to you all My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Turn back now each man from his evil way, and do good, and do not go after other gods to serve them, and you shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers. But you have not extended your ear, nor heeded Me.

16. Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have done the commandment of their father, which He commanded them; but this people has not heeded Me;

17. therefore thus says Jehovah the God of Hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have spoken against them. Because I have spoken to them, but they have not given heed; and I have called to them, but they have not answered.

18. And Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father, and have kept all his precepts, and have done according to all that he has commanded you;

19. therefore thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not lack a man to stand before Me forever.

## Jeremiah 36

1. And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this Word came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,

2. Take for yourself a scroll of a book, and write in it all the Words that I have spoken to you against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day.

3. It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I plan to do to them, that they may turn, each man, from his evil way, so that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.

4. Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah. And Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the Words of Jehovah, which He had spoken to him, on a scroll of a book.

5. And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am confined. I cannot go into the house of Jehovah.

6. Therefore you go, and read from the scroll which you have written at my mouth, the Words of Jehovah in the ears of the people in Jehovahs house on the day of the fast. And also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities.

7. It may be that they will present their supplication before Jehovah, and will turn back, each one from his evil way. For great is the anger and the fury that Jehovah has pronounced against this people.

8. And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading from the book, the Words of Jehovah in the house of Jehovah.

9. And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before Jehovah to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem.

10. And Baruch read from the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah, in the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entrance to the New Gate of the house of Jehovah, in the ears of all the people.

11. When Michaiah, the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the Words of Jehovah from the book,

12. he then went down to the kings house, into the scribes room. And, lo, all the rulers sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the rulers.

13. Then Michaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.

14. Therefore all the rulers sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, Take the scroll in your hand from which you have read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them.

15. And they said to him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.

16. And it happened when they had heard all the words, that they turned to one another in fear and said to Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.

17. And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How did you write all these words at his mouth?

18. Then Baruch answered them, He spoke all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.

19. And the rulers said to Baruch, Go hide yourselves, you and Jeremiah; and let no man know where you are.

20. And they went in to the king, into the court. But they laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.

21. So the king sent Jehudi to bring the scroll. And he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the rulers who stood beside the king.

22. And the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month, the fire burning in the hearth before him.

23. And it happened, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, that he cut it with the scribes knife and threw it into the fire in the hearth, until all the scroll was burned up in the hearth.

24. Yet the king and all his servants who heard these words were not afraid, nor did they tear their garments.

25. But Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had entreated the king that he should not burn the scroll, but he would not consent to them.

26. And the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But Jehovah hid them.

27. Then the Word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, after the king had burned the scroll and the words which Baruch had written at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,

28. Take for yourself another scroll, and write in it all the former Words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.

29. And you shall say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus says Jehovah: You have burned this scroll, saying, Why have you written in it, saying that the king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause man and beast to be annihilated from there?

30. Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have no one to sit on the throne of David. And his dead body shall be cast out into the heat of the day, and the frost of the night.

31. And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity. And I will bring upon them, and upon the people of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have spoken against them; but they have not given heed.

32. Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote in it at the mouth of Jeremiah all the Words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many words like them were added to them.

## Jeremiah 37

1. And King Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had made king in the land of Judah.

2. But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, gave heed to the Words of Jehovah which He spoke by the hand of the prophet Jeremiah.

3. And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to Jehovah our God for us.

4. And Jeremiah came in and went out among the people, for they had not yet put him into prison.

5. And Pharaohs army had come out from Egypt. And when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they departed from Jerusalem.

6. Then the Word of Jehovah came unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying,

7. Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: You shall say this to the king of Judah, who sent you to Me to inquire of Me: Behold, Pharaohs army, which has come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.

8. And the Chaldeans shall come back and fight against this city, and capture it, and burn it with fire.

9. Thus says Jehovah: Do not deceive yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us. For they shall not depart.

10. For though you had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained only wounded men among them, they would rise up, each man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.

11. And it happened when the army of Chaldeans went up from Jerusalem because of Pharaohs army,

12. that Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to claim his property there in the midst of the people.

13. And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a commander of the guard named Irijah was there, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah. And he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You are defecting to the Chaldeans.

14. Then Jeremiah said, False! I am not defecting to the Chaldeans. But he did not listen to him; so Irijah arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the rulers.

15. And the rulers were angry with Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison, the house of Jonathan the scribe. For they had made that the prison.

16. When Jeremiah had entered into the dungeon and the cell, and Jeremiah had remained there many days,

17. then Zedekiah the king sent and took him out. And the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any Word from Jehovah? And Jeremiah said, There is. For, He said, you shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.

18. Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, What have I offended against you, or against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?

19. Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you nor against this land?

20. Therefore please hear now, O my lord the king; I beg you, let my supplication fall before you, so that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.

21. And Zedekiah the king commanded that they should put Jeremiah into the court of the guard, and that they should give him a piece of bread out of the bakers street daily, until all the bread in the city was gone. Thus, Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.

## Jeremiah 38

1. And Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken to all the people, saying,

2. Thus says Jehovah, He who remains in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. But he who goes out to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life as a prize, and shall live.

3. Thus says Jehovah: This city shall be given and bestowed into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall seize it.

4. Therefore the rulers said to the king, Please let this man be put to death. For in this way he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man does not seek the welfare of this people, but their harm.

5. Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand. For the king cannot do a thing against you.

6. And they took Jeremiah and threw him into the pit of Malchijah the son of Hammelech, which was in the court of the guard. And they let Jeremiah down with ropes. And there was no water in the pit, only mud. So Jeremiah sank into the mud.

7. And when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, one of the officials in the kings house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the pit (the king was then sitting in the gate of Benjamin),

8. Ebed-melech went out of the kings house and spoke to the king, saying,

9. My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have thrown into the pit. And he is likely to die of hunger in the place where he is, for there is no more bread in the city.

10. Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take by your hand thirty men from here, and lift Jeremiah the prophet up out of the pit before he dies.

11. So Ebed-melech took the men by his hand and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took worn out clothes and worn out rags from there, and let them down by ropes into the pit to Jeremiah.

12. And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Now put the worn out clothes and rags under your armpits, under the ropes. And Jeremiah did so.

13. So they drew up Jeremiah with ropes and took him up out of the pit. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.

14. And Zedekiah the king sent and had Jeremiah the prophet brought to him at the third gate of the house of Jehovah. And the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask you something. Do not hide anything from me.

15. Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to you, will you not execute me to death? And if I give you advice, you will not give heed to me.

16. So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, As Jehovah lives, who made our souls, I will not put you to death, nor will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life.

17. Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, Thus says Jehovah the God of Hosts, the God of Israel: If you will come out and go forth to the rulers of the king of Babylon, then your soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire. And you and your house shall live.

18. But if you will not go forth to the rulers of the king of Babylon, then this city shall be given into the hands of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape out of their hand.

19. And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews who have defected to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they abuse me.

20. But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver you. I beg of you, obey the voice of Jehovah which I am speaking to you; so it shall be well with you, and your soul shall live.

21. But if you refuse to surrender, this is the Word that Jehovah has shown me:

22. Behold, all the women who are left in the house of the king of Judah shall be brought out to the rulers of the king of Babylon, and they shall say, Your friends have enticed you, and have prevailed against you. Your feet have sunk in the mire, and they have turned away.

23. So they shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans. And you shall not escape out of their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon. And this city shall be burned with fire.

24. Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and you shall not die.

25. But if the rulers hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you and say to you, Declare to us now what you have said to the king, and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us, and we will not put you to death;

26. then you shall say to them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathans house, to die there.

27. Then all the rulers came to Jeremiah and asked him. And he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they quit speaking with him; for the conversation had not been heard.

28. So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was captured. And he was there when Jerusalem was captured.

## Jeremiah 39

1. In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem, and besieged it.

2. In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth of the month, the city was broken into.

3. And all the rulers of the king of Babylon came in and sat in the middle gate: Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, and all the rest of the rulers of the king of Babylon.

4. And it came to pass that when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went out from the city by night, by the way of the kings garden, by the gate between the two walls. And he went out the way of the plain.

5. But the Chaldean army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And they took him, and brought him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced judgment upon him.

6. Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes in Riblah. The king of Babylon also killed all the nobles of Judah.

7. Moreover he put out Zedekiahs eyes and bound him with chains, to bring him to Babylon.

8. And the Chaldeans burned the kings house and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.

9. Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive to Babylon the rest of the people who remained in the city, and those who fell out and defected to him, with the rest of the people that remained.

10. But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poor people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.

11. And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,

12. Take him and look after him, and do him no evil; but do with him even as he says to you.

13. So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, and all the princes of the king of Babylon,

14. even they sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and assigned him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, to take him home. So he lived among the people.

15. Now the Word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying,

16. Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring My Words upon this city for evil and not for good. And they shall be done in that day before you.

17. But I will deliver you in that day, says Jehovah. And you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid.

18. For I will give you an escape, to deliver you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but your life shall be as a prize to you, because you have put your trust in Me, says Jehovah.

## Jeremiah 40

1. This is the Word that came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had set him free from Ramah, when he had taken him, being bound in chains, from among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, who were being carried away captive to Babylon.

2. And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, Jehovah your God has pronounced this evil against this place.

3. Now Jehovah has brought it, and has done according as He has said. Because you have sinned against Jehovah and have not obeyed His voice, therefore this thing has come upon you.

4. And now, behold, I have set you free today from the chains on your hand. If it seems agreeable to you to come with me to Babylon, come; and I will see to your settlement. But if it is displeasing in your eyes to come with me into Babylon, stay. Behold, all the land is before you. Wherever it seems agreeable and right for you to go, go there.

5. And while he had not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and live with him among the people. Or go wherever it seems right to you to go. So the captain of the guard gave him rations and a gratuity, and let him go.

6. Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam at Mizpah. And he lived with him among the people who were left in the land.

7. And when all the commanders of the forces who were in the fields, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had entrusted to him men, and women, and children, and many of the poor of the land, of those who were not exiled to Babylon;

8. then they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai of Netopha, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.

9. And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, Do not fear to serve the Chaldeans. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.

10. As for me, behold, I will live at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans who have come to us. But you go gather wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and live in your cities that you have taken.

11. Also when all the Jews in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan;

12. then all the Jews returned out of all the places where they had been driven, and came to the land of Judah to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits in abundance.

13. Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were in the fields came to Gedaliah at Mizpah,

14. and they said to him, You certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to kill you. But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them.

15. Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Please let me go, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know. Why should he kill you so that all the Jews who are gathered to you should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?

16. But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, You shall not do this thing, for you speak falsely of Ishmael.

## Jeremiah 41

1. And it came to pass in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal seed, and the rulers of the king, and ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam at Mizpah. And there they ate bread together at Mizpah.

2. Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah arose, and the ten men who were with him, and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and killed him whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.

3. Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war.

4. And it came to pass on the second day after he had killed Gedaliah (and no one yet knew it),

5. that some men from Shechem came from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, with their beards shaved, and their clothes torn, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of Jehovah.

6. And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he walked. And it happened as he met them that he said to them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.

7. And so it happened when they came into the middle of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them, he and the men with him, and threw them into the middle of the pit.

8. But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, Do not kill us, for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he left off and did not kill them with their brothers.

9. And the pit into which Ishmael had thrown all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had killed because of Gedaliah, was the one which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel. And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.

10. Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, even the kings daughters and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had entrusted to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took captive and departed to go over to the Ammonites.

11. But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the forces with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,

12. they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah. And they found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.

13. And it happened when all the people with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the forces with him, that they were glad.

14. So all the people that Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.

15. But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.

16. Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces with him took from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; the mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the officials, whom he had brought back from Gibeon.

17. And they departed and stayed in the lodging place of Chimham, which is near Bethlehem, to go to enter Egypt,

18. because of the Chaldeans. For they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.

## Jeremiah 42

1. Then all the commanders of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, came near,

2. and they said to Jeremiah the prophet, Please let us prostrate our supplication to you, and intercede for us to Jehovah your God, even for all this remnant, (for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes behold us),

3. that Jehovah your God may show us the way in which we should walk, and the thing that we should do.

4. And Jeremiah the prophet said to them, I have heard. Behold, I will pray to Jehovah your God according to your words; and it shall be that all the word Jehovah shall answer, I will declare it to you. I will keep nothing back from you.

5. So they said to Jeremiah, Let Jehovah be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not do even according to all things which Jehovah your God shall send you to us.

6. Whether it is good, or whether it is evil, we will obey the voice of Jehovah our God, to whom we send you; so that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of Jehovah our God.

7. And it came to pass after ten days that the Word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah.

8. And he called Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the forces with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,

9. and said to them, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your supplication before Him:

10. If you will still remain in this land, then I will build you and will not pull you down. And I will plant you and will not pluck you up. For I am sorry for you because of the evil that I have brought upon you.

11. Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid. Do not be afraid of him, says Jehovah; for I am with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand.

12. And I will show mercy upon you, so that he may have mercy on you and cause you to return to your own land.

13. But if you say, We will not dwell in this land, nor obey the voice of Jehovah your God,

14. saying, No, but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the shofar, nor hunger for bread; and there we will dwell;

15. then now hear the Word of Jehovah, O remnant of Judah. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: If you decide to set your faces to go into Egypt, and go to live there,

16. then it shall happen that the sword which you feared shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt. And the famine about which you were anxious shall cling to you there in Egypt; and you shall die there.

17. So shall it be to all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to live there. They shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. And none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.

18. For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: As My anger and My fury have been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall My fury be poured forth upon you when you shall enter into Egypt. And you shall be a curse, and a wonder, and a shame, and a reproach; and you shall see this place no more.

19. Jehovah has said concerning you, O remnant of Judah, Do not go into Egypt. Recognize and acknowledge that I have testified against you this day.

20. For you used deceit in your hearts when you sent me to Jehovah your God, saying, Pray for us to Jehovah our God; and according to all that Jehovah our God shall say, declare it to us, and we will do it.

21. And I have declared it to you today; but you have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah your God, nor anything for which He has sent me unto you.

22. Now therefore know and recognize that you shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, in the place where you desire to go to live.

## Jeremiah 43

1. And it happened when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the Words of Jehovah their God, for which Jehovah their God had sent him to them, all these Words,

2. that Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men spoke, saying to Jeremiah, You speak falsely! Jehovah our God has not sent you to say, Do not go to Egypt to live there.

3. But Baruch the son of Neriah is inciting you against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death and to take us captive to Babylon.

4. So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the forces, and all the people, did not obey the voice of Jehovah to live in the land of Judah.

5. But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah who had returned from all the nations (where they had been driven) to dwell in the land of Judah;

6. men, and women, and children, and the kings daughters, and every soul that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.

7. So they came into the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of Jehovah. So they came to Tahpanhes.

8. Then the Word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,

9. Take large stones in your hand, and hide them in the clay in the brick kiln which is at the entrance to Pharaohs house in Tahpanhes, in the eyes of the men of Judah.

10. And say to them, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and will set his throne above these stones that I have hidden. And he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.

11. And when he comes, he shall strike the land of Egypt. And whoever is for death shall go to death; and whoever for captivity, into captivity; and whoever for the sword, to the sword.

12. And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt. And he shall burn them and take them captive. And he shall adorn himself with the land of Egypt, like a shepherd puts on his robe; and he shall go out from there in peace.

13. He shall also break the obelisks of The House of the Sun which are in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt he shall burn with fire.

## Jeremiah 44

1. The Word that came unto Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who live in the land of Egypt, who live in Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the land of Pathros, saying,

2. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: You have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of Judah. And, behold, today they are a desolation, and no one lives there

3. because of their evil which they have done to provoke Me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, to serve other gods whom they knew not, they, you, nor your fathers.

4. But I sent to you all My servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not do this abominable thing which I hate!

5. But they did not heed, nor extend their ear to turn from their evil, to burn no incense to other gods.

6. Therefore My fury and My anger was poured out, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. And they are wasted and deserted, as it is this day.

7. Now therefore thus says Jehovah the God of Hosts, the God of Israel: Why do you commit this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and infant, out of Judah, leaving none remaining;

8. in that you provoke Me to wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have gone to live, that you might cut yourselves off and that you might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?

9. Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have done in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?

10. They have not humbled themselves to this day, nor have they feared, nor walked in My Law, nor in My statutes which I have set before you and before your fathers.

11. Therefore thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set My face against you for evil, to cut off all Judah.

12. And I will take the remnant of Judah, who have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to live there; and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt. They shall be destroyed by the sword and by the famine. They shall die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine; and they shall be a curse, a wonder, and a shame, and a reproach.

13. For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence,

14. so that none of the remnant of Judah who have gone into the land of Egypt to live there shall escape or survive, that they should return into the land of Judah to which they have a desire to return to live there. For no one shall return except those who escape.

15. And all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great multitude, even all the people who lived in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,

16. As for the Word that you have spoken to us in the name of Jehovah, we will not give heed to you.

17. But we will prepare and do whatever goes forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense to the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our rulers, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem. For then we had plenty of food, and were well-off, and saw no evil.

18. But since we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything, and have been consumed by the sword and by famine.

19. And the women also said, when we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven, and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make our cakes in her image, and pour out drink offerings to her without our men?

20. Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and to the women, and to all the people who had given him that answer, saying:

21. The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you, and your fathers, your kings, and your rulers, and the people of the land; did not Jehovah remember them, and did it not come into His mind?

22. Yes, so that Jehovah could no longer hold back because of the evil of your doings, because of the abominations which you have done! Therefore your land is a waste, and a wonder, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is today.

23. Because you have burned incense, and because you have sinned against Jehovah, and have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah, nor walked in His Law, nor in His statutes, nor did you walk in His testimonies, therefore this evil has happened to you, as it is this day.

24. Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people and to all the women, Hear the Word of Jehovah, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt.

25. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, saying: You and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hands, saying, We will prepare and celebrate our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her. You will arise and carry out your vows, and prepare and celebrate your vows.

26. Therefore hear the Word of Jehovah, all Judah that lives in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by My great name, says Jehovah, that My name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord Jehovah lives.

27. Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good. And all the men of Judah in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by famine, until there is an end to them.

28. Yet a small number that escapes the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah; and all the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to live there, shall know whose word shall stand, Mine or theirs.

29. And this shall be a sign to you, says Jehovah, that I will punish you in this place, so that you may know that My Words shall be established and confirmed against you for evil.

30. Thus says Jehovah, Behold, I am giving Pharaoh-hophra, king of Egypt, into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of those who seek his life, just as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, his enemy that sought his life.

## Jeremiah 45

1. The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,

2. Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch:

3. You said, Woe is me now, for Jehovah has added grief to my sorrow. I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.

4. Thus you shall say unto him, Thus says Jehovah: Behold, what I have built I will break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even all this land.

5. And do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them; for behold, I will bring evil on all flesh, says Jehovah. But I will give your life to you as a prize in all places wherever you go.

## Jeremiah 46

1. The Word of Jehovah which came unto Jeremiah the prophet against the nations;

2. against Egypt, against the army of Pharaoh-necho, king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, struck in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah.

3. Set in order the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.

4. Harness the horses, and horsemen mount up. Stand with helmets, polish the spears; put on the armor.

5. Why have I seen them dismayed and turned back? And their mighty ones are beaten down and have fled for refuge, and they do not look back. Terror is all around, says Jehovah.

6. Do not let the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape. They stumbled and fell toward the north, by the River Euphrates.

7. Who is this rising up like a flood, whose waters move like the rivers?

8. Egypt rises up like a flood, and his waters surge about like the rivers. And he says, I will go up and will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and its inhabitants.

9. Come up, you horses; and rage, you chariots! And let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans who handle the shield, and the Lydians who handle and bend the bow.

10. For this is the day of the Lord Jehovah of Hosts, a day of vengeance, that He may avenge Himself of His adversaries. And the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiated and made drunk with their blood, for the Lord Jehovah of Hosts has a sacrifice in the land of the north by the River Euphrates.

11. Go up into Gilead and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt. In vain shall you use many medicines; you shall not be cured.

12. The nations have heard of your shame, and your cry has filled the land. For the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty, and they have both fallen together.

13. The Word which Jehovah spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, of the coming of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, to strike the land of Egypt.

14. Declare it in Egypt, and proclaim it in Migdol, and proclaim it in Noph and in Tahpanhes. Say, Stand fast and get prepared, for the sword shall devour all around you.

15. Why are your mighty ones swept away? They did not stand, because Jehovah thrust them away.

16. He made many fall; yea, one fell upon another. And they said, Arise, and let us go back to our own people and to the land of our birth, away from the oppressing sword.

17. They cried there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he has passed the appointed time.

18. As I live, says the King, whose name is Jehovah of Hosts, Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so he shall come.

19. O daughter dwelling in Egypt, prepare yourself to go into captivity. For Noph shall be waste and desolate, without inhabitant.

20. Egypt is a beautiful heifer, but a stinger comes, it comes from the north.

21. Also her hired ones are in her midst like calves of the stall; for they also have turned back, fleeing together. They did not stand, because the day of their calamity had come upon them, the time of their punishment.

22. Their sound goes like a serpent, for they shall go with strength and come against her with axes like those who cut wood.

23. They shall cut down her forest, says Jehovah, though it cannot be searched; because they are more numerous than the locusts and cannot be counted.

24. The daughter of Egypt shall be ashamed. She shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.

25. Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, along with their gods and their kings; even Pharaoh and all who trust in him;

26. and I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants. And afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, says Jehovah.

27. But do not fear, O My servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel. For behold, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity. And Jacob shall return and have rest and be at ease, and no one shall make him afraid.

28. Do not fear, O Jacob My servant, says Jehovah, for I am with you. For I will make a full end of all the nations where I have driven you. But I will not make a complete end of you, but will correct you in justice; and I will not leave you acquitted nor unpunished.

## Jeremiah 47

1. The Word of Jehovah that came unto Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before Pharaoh struck Gaza.

2. Thus says Jehovah: Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land and all its fullness; the city and those who dwell in it. And the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl.

3. At the noise of the stamping of the hooves of his strong horses, at the rushing of his chariots, the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back for their children because of feebleness of hands;

4. because of the day that comes to plunder all the Philistines and to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every survivor who helps. For Jehovah will plunder the Philistines, the rest of the regions of Caphtor.

5. Baldness has come upon Gaza. Ashkelon is cut off with the rest of their valley. For how long will you cut yourself off?

6. O sword of Jehovah, how long will it be until you are quiet? Put yourself into your sheath; rest and be still.

7. How can it be quiet, since Jehovah has given it a command? He has appointed it there against Ashkelon, and against the seashore.

## Jeremiah 48

1. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, against Moab: Woe to Nebo, for it is plundered! Kirjathaim is dried up and captured. The Fortress is dried up and dismayed.

2. No more praise of Moab. In Heshbon they have plotted evil against it, saying, Come and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also you shall be silenced, O madmen; the sword shall pursue you.

3. A voice of crying shall be heard from Horonaim, plundering and great destruction.

4. Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.

5. For at the ascent to Luhith they go up with continual weeping; for at the descent from Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.

6. Flee, save your lives, and be like a bush in the wilderness.

7. For because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures, you shall also be captured. And Chemosh shall go into captivity along with his priests and his rulers.

8. And the robber shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape. Also the valley shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as Jehovah has spoken.

9. Give wings to Moab so that it may flee and get away; for its cities shall be desolate, without an inhabitant in them.

10. Cursed is he who does the work of Jehovah deceitfully, and cursed is he who keeps back his sword from blood.

11. Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his dregs and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, nor has he gone into captivity. Therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent has not changed.

12. Therefore behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will send ones to lean him, tip him over, and empty his vessels, and shatter his jars.

13. And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.

14. How can you say, We are mighty and strong men for war?

15. Moab is plundered and has gone up out of her cities. And his chosen young men have gone down to the slaughter, says the King, whose name is Jehovah of Hosts.

16. The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hurries quickly.

17. All you who are around him, mourn him. And all you who know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken; the beautiful rod!

18. O daughter dwelling in Dibon, come down from your glory and sit in thirst. For the plunderer of Moab has come upon you; he has destroyed your strongholds.

19. O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way and watch. Ask him who flees and her who escapes; say, What is happening?

20. Moab is withered up, and it is broken down. Howl and cry! Tell it in Arnon that Moab is plundered.

21. And judgment has come upon the plains; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,

22. and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim,

23. and upon Kirjathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon,

24. and upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.

25. The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, says Jehovah.

26. Make him drunk, for he magnified himself against Jehovah. Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be an object of derision.

27. For was not Israel an object of derision to you? Was he found among thieves? For ever since you spoke of him, you skipped for joy.

28. O you who dwell in Moab, leave the cities and live in the rock, and be like the dove that makes her nest in the sides of the mouth of the cave.

29. We have heard of the pride of Moab (he is exceedingly proud), his loftiness, and his pride, and his arrogance, and the haughtiness of his heart.

30. I know his wrath, says Jehovah, but it is not so; his boast, but they have not done it.

31. Therefore I will wail for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab, and shall mourn for the men of Kir-hares.

32. O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for you with the weeping of Jazer. Your plants have gone over the sea; they reach to the sea of Jazer. A plunderer has fallen upon your summer fruits and upon your vintage.

33. And joy and gladness are taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab. And I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses; no one shall tread the grapes with shouting; no joyous shouting.

34. From the cry of Heshbon to Elealeh, and to Jahaz, they have uttered their voice, from Zoar to Horonaim, like a three year old heifer; for the waters of Nimrim also shall be desolate.

35. Moreover, I will put an end to him who offers in the high places in Moab, says Jehovah, who burns incense to his gods.

36. Therefore my heart shall mourn for Moab like flutes, and my heart shall mourn like flutes for the men of Kir-hares, because the riches that he has gotten have perished.

37. For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped. On all the hands shall be cuttings, and on the loins sackcloth.

38. On all the housetops of Moab, and in its streets, there is weeping for all. For I have broken Moab like a vessel in which no one has pleasure, says Jehovah.

39. They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! How has Moab turned the back with shame! Thus Moab shall be an object of derision, and a terror to all those around him.

40. For thus says Jehovah: Behold, he shall fly like an eagle and shall spread his wings over Moab.

41. Kerioth is taken, and the strongholds are seized; and the mighty mens hearts in Moab in that day shall be like the heart of a woman in birth pangs.

42. And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he has magnified himself against Jehovah.

43. Fear and the pit and the snare shall be upon you, O inhabitant of Moab, says Jehovah.

44. He who flees from the terror shall fall into the pit; and he who goes up out of the pit shall be caught in the snare. For I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their judgment, says Jehovah.

45. Those who fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon from fatigue, but a fire shall come out from Heshbon, and a flame out of the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab and the crown of the head of the sons of desolation.

46. Woe to you, O Moab! The people of Chemosh perish; for your sons have been taken captive, and your daughters into captivity.

47. But I will bring back the captives of Moab in the latter days, says Jehovah. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.

## Jeremiah 49

1. Thus says Jehovah to the sons of Ammon: Has Israel no sons? Or has he no heir? Why does their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?

2. Therefore behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will cause a shout of war to be heard in Rabbah of the sons of Ammon. And it shall be a heap of ruins, and her daughter-villages shall be burned with fire. Then Israel shall take possession of his inheritance, says Jehovah.

3. Wail, O Heshbon; for Ai is plundered! Cry, daughters of Rabbah; clothe yourselves with sackcloth, mourn, and run to and fro by the hedges! For their king shall go into captivity with his priests and his rulers together.

4. Why do you glory in the valleys, your flowing valleys, O backsliding daughter; who trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come against me?

5. Behold, I will bring a fear upon you, says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts, from all those who are around you. And you shall be driven out, each man straight forward; and there shall be no one to gather those who stray.

6. And afterward I will bring back the captives of the sons of Ammon, says Jehovah.

7. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts to Edom: Is wisdom no more in Teman? Has counsel perished from the prudent? Has their wisdom vanished?

8. Flee, turn back, dwell in the depths, O inhabitants of Dedan. For I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him in the time that I will punish him.

9. If the gatherers of grapes had come to you, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? If thieves had come by night, would they not destroy until they had enough?

10. But I have made Esau bare; I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself. His seed is plundered, and his brothers and his neighbors; and he is no more.

11. Leave your orphans; I will preserve them alive; and let your widows trust in Me.

12. For thus says Jehovah: Behold, those whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have surely drunk. And are you pure and innocent? You shall not be exempt from punishment, but you shall surely drink.

13. For I have sworn by Myself, says Jehovah, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse. And all its cities shall be perpetual wastes.

14. I have heard a message from Jehovah, and a messenger is sent to the nations, saying, Gather together and come against her, and rise up to the battle.

15. For lo, I will make you small among the nations, despised among men.

16. Your dreadfulness has deceived you, and the pride of your heart, O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, who hold the height of the hill. Though you should make your nest as high as the eagle, I will bring you down from there, says Jehovah.

17. Also Edom shall be an astonishment. Everyone who goes by it shall be appalled and shall hiss at all its plagues.

18. As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors, says Jehovah, no man shall remain there, nor shall a son of man live in it.

19. Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the dwelling of the strong. But I will suddenly make him run away from her. And who is a chosen one that I may appoint over her? For who is like Me? And who will summon Me? And who is that shepherd who will stand before Me?

20. Therefore hear the counsel of Jehovah which He has taken against Edom, and His purposes which He has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall drag them away; surely He shall desolate their dwellings with them.

21. The earth quakes at the sound of their fall; when they cried, its sound was heard at the Red Sea.

22. Behold, he shall come up and fly like the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah. And in that day the heart of the mighty men of Edom shall be like the heart of a woman in birth pangs.

23. Concerning Damascus: Hamath and Arpad are put to shame, for they have heard bad news. Their hearts have melted; the sea is anxious; it cannot be quiet.

24. Damascus has become feeble; she has turned to flee, and trembling has seized her. Anguish and sorrows have taken her like a woman in labor.

25. How has the city of praise not been deserted, the city of my joy!

26. Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be silenced in that day, says Jehovah of Hosts.

27. And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-hadad.

28. Thus says Jehovah concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon shall strike: Arise, go up to Kedar, and plunder the men of the east.

29. They shall take away their tents and their flocks. They shall take their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels to themselves. And they shall cry out to them, Fear is on every side!

30. Flee, go far away, dwell in the depths, O people of Hazor, says Jehovah; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you, and has conceived a plan against you.

31. Arise, go up to the nation that is at ease, that dwells securely, says Jehovah, which has neither gates nor bars, which dwells alone.

32. And their camels shall be for spoils, and the multitude of their cattle for plunder. And I will scatter them to all the winds, cut off to the farthest extremities. And I will bring their calamity from all sides of it, says Jehovah.

33. And Hazor shall be a dwelling for jackals and a desolation forever. No man shall live there, nor any son of man dwell in it.

34. The Word of Jehovah that came unto Jeremiah the prophet against Elam, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,

35. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.

36. And I will bring the four winds from the four corners of the heavens upon Elam, and will scatter them toward all these winds. And there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come.

37. For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies and before those who seek their life. And I will bring evil upon them, even My fierce anger, says Jehovah. And I will send the sword after them until I have finished them;

38. and I will set My throne in Elam, and will destroy the king and the rulers from there, says Jehovah.

39. But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring back the captives of Elam, says Jehovah.

## Jeremiah 50

1. The Word that Jehovah spoke against Babylon, against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.

2. Declare among the nations, proclaim, and lift up a banner. Proclaim and do not hide it; say, Babylon is captured, Bel is ashamed, Merodach is broken in pieces; her images are withered up, her idols are broken in pieces.

3. For out of the north a nation comes up against her, which shall make her land a waste, and no one shall dwell in it. They shall flee, they shall depart, both man and beast.

4. In those days, and at that time, says Jehovah, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping. They shall go and seek Jehovah their God.

5. They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces headed there, saying, Come and let us join ourselves to Jehovah in an everlasting covenant never to be forgotten.

6. My people have been lost sheep; their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains. They have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting place.

7. All who have found them have devoured them. And their enemies said, We have done no wrong, because they have sinned against Jehovah, the habitation of righteousness, even Jehovah, the hope of their fathers.

8. Flee from the midst of Babylon, and go out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be like the rams before the flocks.

9. For, lo, I am stirring up and bringing up against Babylon a company of great nations from a northern land. And they shall array themselves against her. She shall be captured there. Their arrows shall be as those of a skillful, mighty man; none shall return in vain.

10. And Chaldea shall be a spoils; all who plunder her shall be satisfied, says Jehovah.

11. Because you were glad, because you rejoiced, O destroyers of My inheritance; because you are fat like a heifer in lush grass, and bellow like bulls;

12. your mother shall be deeply ashamed; she who bore you shall be embarrassed. Behold, the last of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land and a desert.

13. Because of the wrath of Jehovah it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly a waste. Everyone who goes by Babylon shall be horrified and hiss at all her plagues.

14. Put yourselves in array against Babylon all around; all you who bend the bow, shoot at her, and spare no arrows; for she has sinned against Jehovah.

15. Shout against her all around. She has given her hand; her foundations have fallen, her walls have been thrown down; for it is the vengeance of Jehovah. Take vengeance on her. As she has done, do unto her.

16. Cut off the sower from Babylon, and the one who handles the sickle in the time of harvest. For fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn, each one to his people; and they shall flee, each one to his own land.

17. Israel is like scattered sheep, driven away by lions. First the king of Assyria devoured him, and last this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has crushed his bones.

18. Therefore thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.

19. And I will bring Israel back to his home, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied on Mount Ephraim and Gilead.

20. In those days, and at that time, says Jehovah, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and it shall not be found; and the sins of Judah, but they shall not be found; for I will pardon those whom I spare.

21. Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it and against the inhabitants of Pekod. Waste and exterminate after them, says Jehovah, and do according to all that I have commanded you.

22. A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.

23. How the hammer of the whole earth is chopped off and broken! How Babylon has become a desolation among the nations!

24. I have laid a trap for you, and you have also been caught, O Babylon, and you did not even know it. You have been found and also captured, because you have fought against Jehovah.

25. Jehovah has opened His armory, and has brought forth the weapons of His indignation. For this is the work of the Lord Jehovah of Hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.

26. Come against her from the border; open her storehouses; cast her up as heaps, and destroy her completely. Let nothing of her be left.

27. Kill all her bulls; let them go down to the slaughter. Woe to them! For their day has come, the time of their punishment.

28. The voice of those who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Jehovah our God, the vengeance of His temple.

29. Summon the archers against Babylon. All you who bend the bow, camp against it all around; let none of them escape. Repay her according to her work; according to all that she has done, do to her. For she has been proud against Jehovah, against the Holy One of Israel.

30. Therefore her young men shall fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be silenced in that day, says Jehovah.

31. Behold, I am against you, O proud ones, says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts; for your day has come, the time that I will judge you.

32. And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and no one shall raise him up. And I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall consume everything all around him.

33. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together. And all who captured them have held them fast; they have refused to let them go.

34. Their Redeemer is strong; Jehovah of Hosts, is His name. He shall thoroughly plead their case, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.

35. A sword is upon the Chaldeans, says Jehovah, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her rulers, and upon her wise men.

36. A sword is upon the liars, and they shall become fools. A sword is upon her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed.

37. A sword is upon their horses and their chariots, and upon all the mixed people in her midst; and they shall become as women. A sword is upon her treasures, and they shall be robbed.

38. A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up. For it is the land of graven images, and they act madly and are in dread.

39. Therefore the beasts of the desert shall dwell there with the howling beasts. And the young owls shall dwell in it. And it shall not again be inhabited forever; it shall not be lived in from generation to generation.

40. As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors, says Jehovah, so no man shall remain there, nor shall any son of man live in it.

41. Behold, a people shall come from the north, even a great nation; and many kings shall be aroused from the ends of the earth.

42. They lay hold on the bow and spear; they are cruel and shall not show mercy. Their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride on horses, set in array like a man for battle against you, O daughter of Babylon.

43. The king of Babylon has heard the report of them, and his hands became feeble. Anguish has taken hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in labor.

44. Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of the Jordan against the dwelling of the strong. But I will make them suddenly run away from her. And who is a chosen one whom I may appoint over her? For who is like Me? And who will set My appointments? And who is that shepherd who will face Me?

45. Therefore hear the counsel of Jehovah that He has taken against Babylon; and His purposes which He has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans. Surely the least of the flock shall drag them; surely He shall make their dwelling desolate to them.

46. At the sound of the capture of Babylon the earth quakes, and a cry is heard among the nations.

## Jeremiah 51

1. Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up a destroying wind against Babylon, and against those dwelling in their midst who rise up against Me.

2. And I will send strangers into Babylon who shall winnow her and shall empty her land. For in the day of calamity they shall be against her all around.

3. Do not let the archer tread and bend his bow; nor lift himself up in his armor. And do not spare her young men; utterly destroy all her army.

4. Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, those thrust through in her streets.

5. For neither Israel nor Judah has been forsaken by his God, Jehovah of Hosts, though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.

6. Flee out of the middle of Babylon, and each man deliver his soul. Do not be cut off in her iniquity, for this is the time of Jehovahs vengeance; He will make good her recompense.

7. Babylon has been a golden cup in Jehovahs hand, which made all the earth drunk. The nations have drunk her wine; therefore the nations are deranged.

8. Babylon has suddenly fallen and been destroyed. Wail for her; take balm for her pain, if perhaps she may be healed.

9. We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed. Forsake her and let us go, each one into his own land; for her judgment reaches to the heavens and is lifted up to the skies.

10. Jehovah has brought forth our righteousness; come and let us declare in Zion the work of Jehovah our God.

11. Polish the arrows; gather the shields. Jehovah has raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes. For His plan is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of Jehovah, the vengeance of His temple.

12. Set up the banner on the walls of Babylon; make the guard strong; set up the watchmen; prepare the ambushes. For Jehovah has both planned and done that which He spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon.

13. O you who live on many waters, rich in treasures, your end has come, and the measure of your unjust gain.

14. Jehovah of Hosts has sworn by Himself, saying, Surely I will fill you with men as with locust caterpillars; and they shall lift up a shout against you.

15. He has made the earth by His power; He has established the world by His wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by His understanding.

16. When He utters His voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and He causes the mists to ascend from the ends of the earth. He makes lightnings with rain and brings forth the wind out of His treasures.

17. Every man is stupid in knowledge; every refiner is put to shame by graven images. For his molten image is deception, and there is no breath in them.

18. They are vanity, the work of errors; in the time of their judgment they shall perish.

19. The Portion of Jacob is not like them; for He is the Former of all things, and Israel is the offshoot of His inheritance. Jehovah of Hosts is His name.

20. You are My battle-ax and weapons of war; for with you I will shatter nations; and with you I will destroy kingdoms.

21. And with you I will shatter the horse and his rider; and with you I will shatter the chariot and his rider.

22. Also with you I will shatter man and woman; and with you I will shatter old and young; and with you I will shatter the young man and the maiden.

23. I will also shatter the shepherd and his flock with you. And with you I will shatter the farmer and his yoke of oxen; and with you I will shatter governors and rulers.

24. And I will recompense unto Babylon, and unto all the inhabitants of Chaldea, all the evil that they have done in Zion in your eyes, says Jehovah.

25. Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain, says Jehovah, who destroys all the earth. And I will stretch out My hand upon you and roll you down from the rocks, and will make you a burnt mountain.

26. And they shall not take a stone from you for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but you shall be a waste forever, says Jehovah.

27. Set up a banner in the land; blow the shofar among the nations; prepare the nations against her. Call the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz together against her; appoint a commander against her. Cause the horses to come up as the bristling caterpillars.

28. Consecrate nations against her, with the kings of the Medes, her governors and all her rulers, and all the land of his realm.

29. And the land shall tremble and writhe. For every purpose of Jehovah shall be fulfilled against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a waste without inhabitant.

30. The mighty men of Babylon have stopped fighting; they have remained in strongholds; their might has failed. They became like women; they have burned her dwellings; the bars of her gates are broken.

31. A runner shall run to meet a runner, and a herald to a herald, to report to the king of Babylon that his city is captured from end to end;

32. and that the passages are blocked; and they have burned the reeds with fire, and the men of war are frightened.

33. For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor, and it is time to thresh her. Yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.

34. Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me; he has crushed me; he has made me an empty vessel. He has swallowed me up like a dragon; he has filled his stomach with my delicacies; he has rinsed me out.

35. The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, the inhabitant of Zion shall say. And, My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, Jerusalem shall say.

36. Therefore thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will plead your case and take vengeance for you; and I will dry up her sea and make her springs dry.

37. And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for dragons, a horror and a hissing, without inhabitant.

38. They shall roar together like lions; they shall growl like lions cubs.

39. In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunk so that they may rejoice and sleep a never-ending sleep, and not wake up, says Jehovah.

40. I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with the male goats.

41. How Sheshach is captured! And how the praise of the whole earth is seized! How Babylon has become a waste among the nations!

42. The sea has come up over Babylon; she is covered with the multitude of its waves.

43. Her cities are desolate, a dry land and a wilderness, a land in which no man dwells, nor does any son of man pass by it.

44. And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up. And the nations shall not flow together to him any more; yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.

45. My people, go out of her midst; and let each man deliver his soul from the fierce anger of Jehovah.

46. And let not your heart faint, nor fear the rumor that shall be heard in the land. The report shall come in a year. And after that a report shall come in another year; and violence shall be in the land, ruler against ruler.

47. Therefore, behold, the days are coming that I will punish the graven images of Babylon. And all her land shall be put to shame, and all her slain shall fall in her midst.

48. And the heavens and the earth, and all that is in them, shall shout for joy over Babylon; for the plunderers shall come to her from the north, says Jehovah.

49. As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon the slain of all the earth shall fall.

50. You who have escaped the sword, go away! Do not stand still! Remember Jehovah from afar, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.

51. We are confounded because we have heard reproach. Shame has covered our faces, for strangers have come into the sanctuaries of Jehovahs house.

52. Therefore behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will punish her graven images, and throughout all her land the wounded shall groan.

53. Though Babylon should mount up to the heavens, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet plunderers shall come unto her from Me, says Jehovah.

54. The sound of a cry comes from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans,

55. because Jehovah is plundering Babylon, and the loud voice has been blotted out of her. Her waves are turbulent like great waters, they have made a great roaring sound;

56. because the plunderer has come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are captured. Every one of their bows is broken, for Jehovah, the Mighty God of recompenses, makes good the recompense.

57. And I will make her rulers drunk, along with her wise ones, her governors, and her officials, and her mighty men. And they shall sleep a never-ending sleep and not wake up, says the King whose name is Jehovah of Hosts.

58. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: The broad walls of Babylon shall be completely broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the nation shall labor in vain, and the people shall be in the fire, and they shall be weary.

59. The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And Seraiah was a quiet leader.

60. So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that would come upon Babylon, all these words that are written against Babylon.

61. And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When you arrive in Babylon, and have seen, and have read all these words,

62. then you shall say, O Jehovah, You have spoken against this place to cut it off, so that no one shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be a waste forever.

63. And it shall be when you have made an end of reading this book, that you shall tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates.

64. And you shall say, In this way shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise, from the evil that I will bring upon her. And they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.

## Jeremiah 52

1. Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mothers name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

2. And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.

3. For although the anger of Jehovah was upon Jerusalem and Judah (until He had cast them out from His presence), Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

4. And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it and built siege walls against it all around.

5. So the city was under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.

6. And in the fourth month, in the ninth of the month, the famine was so severe in the city, so that there was no food for the people of the land.

7. Then the city was broken into, and all the men of war fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the kings garden. (And the Chaldeans lay in wait all around the city.) And they went by the way of the plain.

8. But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And all his army was scattered from him.

9. So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon, to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he passed judgment against him.

10. And the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. He also killed all the rulers of Judah in Riblah.

11. And he put out the eyes of Zedekiah. And the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and brought him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.

12. And in the fifth month, on the tenth of the month, (which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, who served the king of Babylon, came into Jerusalem.

13. And he burned the house of Jehovah, and the kings house. And he burned with fire all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great ones.

14. And all the army of the Chaldeans, with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around.

15. And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took captive some of the poor of the people, and the rest of the people who remained in the city, and those who deserted, who had defected to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.

16. But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poor of the land as vinedressers and farmers.

17. Also the Chaldeans broke the pillars of bronze that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases, and the bronze sea in the house of Jehovah, and carried all the bronze from them to Babylon.

18. They also took away the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of bronze with which they ministered.

19. And the captain of the guard took away the basins, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the pots, and the lampstands, and the spoons, and the cups; what was gold, in gold; and what was silver, in silver.

20. The two pillars, one sea, and twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases, which King Solomon had made in the house of Jehovah; the bronze of all these vessels was without weight.

21. And concerning the pillars: the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits. And a measuring line of twelve cubits went around it, and its thickness was four fingers; it was hollow.

22. And a capital of bronze was on it. And the height of one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capitals all around, all of bronze. The second pillar also, and the pomegranates, were like these.

23. And there were ninety-six pomegranates on a side; all the pomegranates on the network were a hundred all around.

24. And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers.

25. He also took out of the city an official who was in charge of the men of war; and seven men from those who were close to the king, who were found in the city; and the chief scribe of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the middle of the city.

26. And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.

27. And the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was taken captive out of his own land.

28. These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar took captive: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews;

29. in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he took captive from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons;

30. in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took captive seven hundred and forty-five persons of the Jews. All the persons were four thousand and six hundred.

31. And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the twenty-fifth of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him out of prison,

32. and spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon.

33. And he changed from his prison garments, and he ate bread before him all the days of his life.

34. And as for his allowance: a continual allowance was given him from the king of Babylon, the matter day by day, until the day of his death, all the days of his life.
