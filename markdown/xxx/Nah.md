# Nahum

## Nahum 1

1. The burden against Nineveh: The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.

2. The Mighty God is jealous, and Jehovah avenges, Jehovah avenges and is a possessor of wrath. Jehovah takes vengeance against His foes, and He maintains wrath against His enemies.

3. Jehovah is slow to anger, and great of power, and He does not by any means acquit the guilty. Jehovah has His way in the tempest and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of His feet.

4. He rebukes the sea and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel wither, and the flower of Lebanon wilts.

5. The mountains quake before Him, and the hills melt; and the earth is lifted up before Him, even the world and all who dwell in it.

6. Who can stand before His indignation? And who can endure His burning anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken down because of Him.

7. Jehovah is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and He knows those who trust in Him.

8. But with an overrunning flood He will make a complete end of its place, and darkness shall pursue His enemies.

9. What are you plotting against Jehovah? He will make a complete end of it; affliction shall not rise up a second time.

10. For as thorns are woven together, and as their drunkards are drunken, they shall be devoured like fully dried straw.

11. One who devises evil against Jehovah has come forth from you, one counseling worthlessness.

12. Thus says Jehovah, Though they are secure and so numerous, yet they will be cut off and pass away. And though I have afflicted you, I will not afflict you any more.

13. And now I will break off his yoke from you and will tear away your bonds.

14. And Jehovah has given command concerning you. Not one of your name shall be sown any more; I will cut off the carved image and the molten image out of the house of your gods; I will appoint your grave, for you are of no account.

15. Behold, on the mountains the feet of Him bearing good tidings, proclaiming, Peace! O Judah, keep your feasts; fulfill your vows; for the wicked will no more pass through you; he is completely cut off.

## Nahum 2

1. The one scattering is coming up against your face. Guard the rampart; watch the way; make the loins strong, firm up your power exceedingly.

2. For Jehovah has restored the excellence of Jacob as the excellence of Israel. For the emptiers have emptied them and have destroyed their vine branches.

3. The shield of his mighty ones has become red, the mighty men are clothed in scarlet, the chariots will come like iron torches in the day of his preparation, and the cypresses are made to shake terribly.

4. The chariots run madly in the streets; they rush to and fro in the broad ways. Their appearance is like torches; they run swiftly like lightning.

5. He shall remember its nobles; they shall stumble in their walking; they shall hurry to its wall, and the defense shall be prepared.

6. The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be melted.

7. And she who stood firm shall be uncovered and carried away; and her maidservants shall lead on, moaning like the sound of doves, beating on their breasts.

8. And Nineveh of old is like a pool of water; yet they are fleeing. They cry, Halt! Halt! But no one turns back.

9. Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! For there is no end to the treasures, and riches from all precious objects.

10. She is empty, desolate, and waste. And the heart is melted, and the knees knocking; and trembling is in all the loins; and all of their faces are flushed.

11. Where is the den of the lions and the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion, the lioness, the lionÂ’s cub walked, and no one made them afraid?

12. The lion tore in pieces, enough for his cubs, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, even his lairs with torn prey.

13. Behold, I am against you, declares Jehovah of Hosts; and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour your young lions. And I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers shall not be heard any more.

## Nahum 3

1. Woe to the bloody city! It is all full of lies and robbery; the prey does not depart.

2. The sound of a whip, and the sound of rattling of wheels, and galloping horses, and of bounding chariots.

3. The horseman lifts up both the gleaming sword and the glittering spear, and many are slain, and there is a mass of dead bodies, and no end of corpses; they stumble over their dead bodies,

4. because of the many harlotries of the seductive harlot, the mistress of sorceries who sells nations by her harlotries, and families by her sorceries.

5. Behold, I am against you, declares Jehovah of Hosts, and I will uncover your skirts over your face, and I will show the nations your nakedness, and the kingdoms your shame.

6. And I will cast detestable filth on you and will disgrace you. And I will set you as a spectacle.

7. And it shall be that all those who look upon you shall flee from you and shall say, Nineveh is laid waste; who shall weep for her? From where shall I seek comforters for you?

8. Are you better than populous No that dwelt among the rivers, waters surrounding her, whose rampart was the sea, whose wall was the sea?

9. Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and without end; Put and Lubim were your helpers.

10. Yet she was carried away; she went into captivity. Also her young ones were dashed to pieces at the head of all the streets, and they cast lots for her honored ones, and all her great ones were bound in chains.

11. You also shall be drunken; you shall be hidden; you also shall seek refuge from the enemy.

12. All your fortresses are fig trees with the firstfruits; if they are shaken, then they shall fall into the mouth of the eater.

13. Behold, your people in your midst are women; the gates of your land shall surely be opened to your enemies; the fire shall devour your bars.

14. Draw your water for the siege. Strengthen your fortifications. Go into the clay and tread in the mortar. Make the mold strong.

15. Fire will devour you there. The sword shall cut you off. It will eat you up like the caterpillar. Make yourself as many as the caterpillar; multiply yourself like the locusts.

16. You have increased your merchants more than the stars of the heavens; the caterpillar shall strip off and fly away.

17. Your princes are like the locusts, and your officials are a swarm of locusts that camp in the hedges in the cold day. When the sun rises and they flee, the place where they are is not known.

18. Your shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria; your nobles are lying down. Your people are scattered on the mountains, and no one gathers them.

19. There is no healing for your fracture; your wound is severe. All who hear the report of you shall clap their hands over you, for on whom has your wickedness not passed continually?
