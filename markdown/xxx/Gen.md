# Genesis

## Genesis 1

1. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

2. And the earth was without form, and void, with darkness on the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.

3. Then God said, Let there be light! And there was light.

4. And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided between the light and darkness.

5. God called the light, Day; and the darkness He called, Night. Thus, the evening and the morning: Day One.

6. Then God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, separating the waters from the waters.

7. And God made the firmament, and separated the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: thus.

8. And God called the firmament, Heavens. Thus, the evening and the morning: Day Two.

9. Then God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear: thus.

10. And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of the waters He called, Seas. And God saw that it was good.

11. And God said, Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and the fruit tree producing fruit according to its kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth: thus.

12. And the earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to its kind, and the tree producing fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.

13. Thus, the evening and the morning: Day Three.

14. Then God said, Let there be luminaries in the firmament of the heavens, to distinguish the day from the night; and let them be for signs and seasons, and for days and years;

15. and let them be for luminaries in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth: thus.

16. And God made two great luminaries: the greater luminary to rule the day, and the lesser luminary to rule the night, and also the stars.

17. And God set them in the firmament of the heavens to shine upon the earth,

18. and to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.

19. Thus, the evening and the morning: Day Four.

20. Then God said, Let the waters swarm with swarming living creatures, and let flying creatures fly to and fro above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens.

21. So God created great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, that swarmed in the waters according to their kind, and every winged flying creature according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.

22. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the flying creatures multiply on the earth.

23. Thus, the evening and the morning: Day Five.

24. Then God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind: beasts, creeping things and living things of the earth, each according to its kind: thus.

25. And God made the living things of the earth according to its kind, beasts according to its kind, and everything that creeps on the earth according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.

26. Then God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the flying creatures of the heavens, and over the beasts, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that moves on the earth.

27. So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.

28. And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the flying creatures of the heavens, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.

29. And God said, Behold, I have given you every plant that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food.

30. Also, to every living thing of the earth, to every flying creature of the heavens, and to everything that moves on the earth, living creatures, I have given the green plants for food: thus.

31. And God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was extremely good. Thus, the evening and the morning: Day Six.

## Genesis 2

1. Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished.

2. And on the seventh day God completed His work which He had made, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.

3. And God blessed the seventh day and consecrated it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.

4. These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God was making the earth and the heavens,

5. before any shrub of the field was on the earth and before any green plant of the field had sprouted; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to till the ground;

6. but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground.

7. And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

8. And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He put the man whom He had formed.

9. And out of the ground Jehovah God made to sprout every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The Tree of Life was also in the midst of the garden, and also the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

10. And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four heads.

11. The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one which circles around all the land of Havilah, where there is gold;

12. and the gold of that land is good. Bdellium and the onyx stone are there.

13. The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one which circles around all the land of Cush.

14. The name of the third river is Tigris; it is the one going toward the east of Assyria. The fourth river is Euphrates.

15. Then Jehovah God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.

16. And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may eat to feed;

17. but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die the death.

18. And Jehovah God said, It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper to complement him.

19. Out of the ground Jehovah God formed every living thing of the field and every flying creature of the heavens, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.

20. So the man gave names to all the animals, to the flying creatures of the heavens, and to every living thing of the field. But for the man there was not found a helper to complement him.

21. And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.

22. And the rib which Jehovah God had taken out of the man He rebuilt into a woman, and He brought her to the man.

23. And the man said: This now at last is bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man.

24. Therefore a man, leaving his father and mother, and having cleaved to his wife, they are one flesh.

25. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.

## Genesis 3

1. Now the serpent was more cunning than any living thing of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said to the woman, Has God indeed said, You shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

2. And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden;

3. but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.

4. And the serpent said to the woman, You shall not die the death.

5. For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be as God, knowing good and evil.

6. So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.

7. And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings.

8. And they heard the sound of Jehovah God walking around in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God among the trees of the garden.

9. And Jehovah God called to the man and said to him, Where are you?

10. And he said, I heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.

11. And He said, Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?

12. And the man said, The woman whom You gave to be with me, she has given to me of the tree, and I ate.

13. And Jehovah God said to the woman, What is this you have done? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.

14. So Jehovah God said to the serpent: Because you have done this, you are cursed more than all beasts, and more than every living thing of the field; on your belly you shall go, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.

15. And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel.

16. To the woman He said: I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in pain you shall bring forth children; your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.

17. And to Adam He said, Because you have heeded the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it: Cursed is the ground for your sake; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life.

18. Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you, and you shall eat the plants of the field.

19. In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground, for out of it you have been taken; for dust you are, and to dust you shall return.

20. And the man called his wifes name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.

21. Also for the man and his wife Jehovah God made tunics of skins, and clothed them.

22. And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man has become as one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, that he not put forth his hand and take also of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever;

23. therefore Jehovah God sent him out of the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken.

24. So He drove out the man; and He placed cherubim at the east of the Garden of Eden, and a flaming sword turning this way and that, to guard the way to the Tree of Life.

## Genesis 4

1. And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, and said, I have acquired a man from Jehovah.

2. And she bore again, his brother Abel. And Abel tended flocks, but Cain worked the ground.

3. And at the end of so many days it came to pass that Cain brought an offering of the fruit of the ground unto Jehovah.

4. Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat. And Jehovah had regard for Abel and his offering,

5. but He did not have regard for Cain and his offering. And Cains anger burned greatly, and his countenance fell.

6. So Jehovah said to Cain, Why does your anger burn? And why has your countenance fallen?

7. If you do well, is there not exaltation? And if you do not do well, sin is lying at the door. And its desire is for you, but you must rule over it.

8. Now Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.

9. And Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? He said, I do not know. Am I my brothers keeper?

10. And He said, What have you done? The voice of your brothers blood cries out to Me from the ground.

11. So now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brothers blood from your hand.

12. When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength to you. A fugitive and a vagabond you shall be on the earth.

13. And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear!

14. Behold, You have driven me out this day from the face of the ground; I shall be hidden from Your face; I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, and it will happen that anyone who finds me will kill me.

15. And Jehovah said to him, Therefore, whoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken upon him sevenfold. And Jehovah set a mark on Cain, so that anyone finding him should not kill him.

16. And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah and dwelt in the land of Nod, east of Eden.

17. And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son: Enoch.

18. To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech.

19. And Lamech took for himself two wives: the name of one was Adah, and the name of the second was Zillah.

20. And Adah bore Jabal: He was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.

21. His brothers name was Jubal: He was the father of all those who play the harp and flute.

22. And as for Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain: One hammering in every craft of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah.

23. And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah: Hear my voice, you wives of Lamech, listen to my speech! For I have killed a man for wounding me, even a young man for striking me.

24. If Cain is avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.

25. And the man knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name: Seth, for God has appointed another seed for me instead of Abel; because Cain killed him.

26. And as for Seth, to him also a son was born; and he called his name Enosh. Then they began to call upon the name of Jehovah.

## Genesis 5

1. This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, He made him in the likeness of God.

2. He created them male and female, and blessed them, and called their name Mankind in the day when they were created.

3. And Adam lived one hundred and thirty years, and begot a son in his own likeness, after his image, and called his name Seth.

4. After he begot Seth, the days of Adam were eight hundred years; and he begot sons and daughters.

5. So all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years; and he died.

6. Seth lived one hundred and five years, and begot Enosh.

7. After he begot Enosh, Seth lived eight hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.

8. So all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years; and he died.

9. Enosh lived ninety years, and begot Cainan.

10. After he begot Cainan, Enosh lived eight hundred and fifteen years, and begot sons and daughters.

11. So all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years; and he died.

12. Cainan lived seventy years, and begot Mahalalel.

13. After he begot Mahalalel, Cainan lived eight hundred and forty years, and begot sons and daughters.

14. So all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.

15. Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, and begot Jared.

16. After he begot Jared, Mahalalel lived eight hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.

17. So all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred and ninety-five years; and he died.

18. Jared lived one hundred and sixty-two years, and begot Enoch.

19. After he begot Enoch, Jared lived eight hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.

20. So all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years; and he died.

21. Enoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Methuselah.

22. After he begot Methuselah, Enoch walked with God three hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.

23. So all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.

24. And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God carried him away.

25. Methuselah lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, and begot Lamech.

26. After he begot Lamech, Methuselah lived seven hundred and eighty-two years, and begot sons and daughters.

27. So all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty-nine years; and he died.

28. Lamech lived one hundred and eighty-two years, and begot a son.

29. And he called his name Noah, saying, This one will comfort us concerning our work and the toil of our hands, because of the ground which Jehovah has cursed.

30. After he begot Noah, Lamech lived five hundred and ninety-five years, and begot sons and daughters.

31. So all the days of Lamech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years; and he died.

32. And Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah begot Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

## Genesis 6

1. Now it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them,

2. that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were pleasing; and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose.

3. And Jehovah said, My Spirit shall not continually strive with man, for indeed it is in flesh to sin; yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.

4. There were giants on the earth in those days. And also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men and they bore children to them, these were the mighty men from antiquity, men of renown.

5. And Jehovah saw that the evil of man was great on the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all day long.

6. And Jehovah regretted that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved to His heart.

7. And Jehovah said, I will obliterate man whom I have created from off the face of the earth, both man and beast, creeping thing and flying creatures of the heavens, for I regret having made them.

8. But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.

9. These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a just man, perfect in his generation. Noah walked with God.

10. And Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

11. The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.

12. And God looked upon the earth, and behold it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.

13. And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with violence through them; and behold, I will destroy them along with the earth.

14. Make yourself an ark of gopherwood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch.

15. And this is how you shall make it: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.

16. You shall make a window for the ark, and you shall finish it to a cubit from above; and set the door of the ark in its side. You shall make it with lower, second, and third levels.

17. And behold I, even I, am bringing a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy from under the heavens all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that is on the earth shall die.

18. And I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall go into the ark; you, your sons, your wife, and your sons wives with you.

19. And of every living thing of all flesh you shall bring two of every kind into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.

20. Of flying creatures after their kind, of animals after their kind, and of every creeping thing of the earth after its kind, two of every kind will come in to you, to keep them alive.

21. And take for yourself of all food that is eaten, and gather it to yourself; and it shall be food for you and for them.

22. Thus Noah did; according to all that God commanded him, so he did.

## Genesis 7

1. And Jehovah said to Noah, Come into the ark, you and all your house, for I have seen you as being righteous before Me in this generation.

2. You shall take unto you of every clean animal seven and seven, a male and his female; and two each of animals that are not clean, a male and his female;

3. also seven and seven of the flying creatures of the heavens, male and female, to keep seed alive on the face of all the earth.

4. For after seven more days I will cause it to rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and I will obliterate from off the face of the earth all living substance that I have made.

5. And Noah did according to all that Jehovah commanded him.

6. Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.

7. So Noah, with his sons, his wife, and his sons wives, went into the ark because of the waters of the flood.

8. Of clean animals, of animals that are not clean, of flying creatures, and of everything that moves upon the earth,

9. two by two they went into the ark to Noah, male and female, as God had commanded Noah.

10. And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.

11. In the six hundredth year of Noahs life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of the heavens were opened.

12. And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

13. On the very same day Noah and Noahs sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and Noahs wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered the ark;

14. they and every living thing after its kind, all animals after their kind, every creeping thing that moves on the earth after its kind, and every flying creature after its kind, every bird of every wing.

15. And they went into the ark to Noah, two by two, of all flesh in which is the breath of life.

16. So those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him. And Jehovah shut him in.

17. And the flood was on the earth forty days. The waters increased and lifted up the ark, and it was high above the earth.

18. The waters prevailed and greatly increased upon the earth, and the ark moved about upon the surface of the waters.

19. And the waters prevailed with abundant force upon the earth, and all the high hills under the heavens were covered.

20. The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the mountains were covered.

21. And all flesh died that moved on the earth: flying creatures and animals and living things and every creeping thing that moves on the earth, and every man.

22. All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, all that was on the dry land, died.

23. So He obliterated all living substance which was on the face of the ground: both man and animal, creeping thing and flying creatures of the heavens. They were obliterated from off the earth. Only Noah and those who were with him in the ark were left alive.

24. And the waters prevailed upon the earth one hundred and fifty days.

## Genesis 8

1. And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the animals that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.

2. The fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were also stopped, and the rain from the heavens was restrained.

3. And the waters receded from the earth, going out and coming back. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were decreased.

4. And the ark rested in the seventh month, the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat.

5. And the waters continued to go and decrease until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.

6. And it came to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made.

7. And he sent out a raven, which kept going to and fro until the waters had dried up from off the earth.

8. He also sent out from himself a dove, to see if the waters had receded from off the face of the ground.

9. But the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, and she returned into the ark to him, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her, and drew her into the ark to himself.

10. And he waited yet another seven days, and again he sent the dove out from the ark.

11. And the dove came to him in the evening, and behold, a freshly plucked olive leaf was in her mouth; so Noah knew that the waters had receded from off the earth.

12. So he waited yet another seven days and sent out the dove, which did not return again to him anymore.

13. And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, that the waters were dried up from off the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold, the surface of the ground was dry.

14. And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dried.

15. And God spoke to Noah, saying,

16. Go out from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons wives with you.

17. Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that is with you: flying creatures and animals and every creeping thing that moves on the earth, so that they may swarm on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth.

18. So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him.

19. Every living thing, every creeping thing, every flying creature, and everything that moves on the earth, according to their kind, went out of the ark.

20. And Noah built an altar unto Jehovah, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.

21. And Jehovah smelled a soothing aroma. And Jehovah said in His heart, I will never again curse the ground because of man, although the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth; nor will I again smite every living thing as I have done.

22. While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.

## Genesis 9

1. So God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them: Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.

2. And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every living thing of the earth, upon every flying creature of the heavens, upon everything that moves on the earth, and upon all the fish of the sea. They have been entrusted into your hand.

3. Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. I have designated all things for you, even as the green plants.

4. But you shall not eat flesh with its soul, that is, its blood.

5. Surely the blood of your souls will I require; at the hand of every living thing will I require it, and at the hand of man. At the hand of every mans brother I will require the soul of man.

6. Whoever sheds mans blood, by man his blood shall be shed; for in the image of God He made man.

7. And as for you, be fruitful and multiply; swarm in the earth and multiply in it.

8. And God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying:

9. And as for Me, behold, I establish My covenant with you and with your seed after you,

10. and with every living creature that is with you: the flying creatures, the animals, and every living thing of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ark, every living thing of the earth.

11. Thus I have established My covenant with you: Never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood; never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.

12. And God said, This is the sign of the covenant which I am making between Me and you, and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:

13. I set My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be for the sign of the covenant between Me and the earth.

14. It shall be, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow shall be seen in the cloud;

15. and I will remember My covenant which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.

16. The rainbow shall be in the cloud, and I will look upon it to remember the perpetual covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.

17. And God said to Noah, This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is upon the earth.

18. Now the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And Ham was the father of Canaan.

19. These three were the sons of Noah, and from these they scattered throughout the whole earth.

20. And Noah began to be a man of the land, and he planted a vineyard.

21. Then he drank of the wine and was drunk, and was uncovered in his tent.

22. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.

23. But Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on both their shoulders, and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were backward, and they did not see the nakedness of their father.

24. And Noah awoke from his wine, and perceived what his younger son had done to him.

25. And he said: Cursed is Canaan; a servant of servants he shall be to his brethren.

26. And he said: Blessed is Jehovah the God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

27. God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

28. And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

29. So all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.

## Genesis 10

1. Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And sons were born to them after the flood.

2. The sons of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.

3. The sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.

4. The sons of Javan were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.

5. From these the regions of the nations were separated into their lands, everyone according to their tongue, according to their families, into their nations.

6. The sons of Ham were Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.

7. The sons of Cush were Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabtechah; and the sons of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan.

8. And Cush begot Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one on the earth.

9. He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah; therefore it is said, Like Nimrod the mighty hunter before Jehovah.

10. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

11. From that land he went forth to Assyria and built Nineveh, the city of Rehoboth and Calah,

12. and Resen between Nineveh and Calah, which was a large city.

13. Mizraim begot Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,

14. Pathrusim, and Casluhim (from whom came the Philistines), and Caphtorim.

15. Canaan begot Sidon his firstborn, and Heth;

16. the Jebusite, the Amorite, and the Girgashite;

17. the Hivite, the Arkite, and the Sinite;

18. the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were scattered.

19. And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as you go toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; then as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.

20. These were the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands and in their nations.

21. And to Shem also, the older brother of Japheth, and father of all the sons of Eber, sons were born.

22. The sons of Shem were Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram.

23. The sons of Aram were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.

24. Arphaxad begot Salah, and Salah begot Eber.

25. To Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided; and his brothers name was Joktan.

26. Joktan begot Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,

27. Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,

28. Obal, Abimael, Sheba,

29. Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan.

30. And their dwelling place was from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, a mountain in the east.

31. These were the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands, according to their nations.

32. These were the families of the sons of Noah, according to their generations, in their nations; and from these the nations were divided on the earth after the flood.

## Genesis 11

1. Now the whole earth was of one language and one speech.

2. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a level valley in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there.

3. Then they said to one another, Come, let us make bricks and burn them with burning. They had brick for stone, and they had asphalt for mortar.

4. And they said, Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top is in the heavens; let us make a name for ourselves, that we not be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.

5. And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built.

6. And Jehovah said, Behold, the people are one and they all have one language, and this is what they begin to do; now nothing that they devise to do will be withheld from them.

7. Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, that they cannot understand one anothers speech.

8. So Jehovah scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city.

9. Therefore its name is called Babel, because there Jehovah confused the language of all the earth; and from there Jehovah scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.

10. These are the generations of Shem: Shem was one hundred years old, and begot Arphaxad two years after the flood.

11. After he begot Arphaxad, Shem lived five hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.

12. Arphaxad lived thirty-five years, and begot Salah.

13. After he begot Salah, Arphaxad lived four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.

14. Salah lived thirty years, and begot Eber.

15. After he begot Eber, Salah lived four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.

16. Eber lived thirty-four years, and begot Peleg.

17. After he begot Peleg, Eber lived four hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.

18. Peleg lived thirty years, and begot Reu.

19. After he begot Reu, Peleg lived two hundred and nine years, and begot sons and daughters.

20. Reu lived thirty-two years, and begot Serug.

21. After he begot Serug, Reu lived two hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.

22. Serug lived thirty years, and begot Nahor.

23. After he begot Nahor, Serug lived two hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.

24. Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and begot Terah.

25. After he begot Terah, Nahor lived one hundred and nineteen years, and begot sons and daughters.

26. Now Terah lived seventy years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

27. These are the generations of Terah: Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran begot Lot.

28. And Haran died before his father Terah in his native land, in Ur of the Chaldeans.

29. And Abram and Nahor took wives: the name of Abrams wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahors wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah.

30. But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

31. And Terah took his son Abram and his grandson Lot, the son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, his son Abrams wife, and they went out with them from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran and dwelt there.

32. And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in Haran.

## Genesis 12

1. Now Jehovah said to Abram: Depart from your land, from your kindred and from your fathers house, to a land that I will show you.

2. I will make of you a great nation; I will bless you and make your name great; and you shall be a blessing.

3. I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who despises you; and in you all families of the earth shall be blessed.

4. So Abram departed as Jehovah had spoken to him, and Lot went with him. And Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.

5. And Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brothers son, and all their possessions that they had collected, and the souls they had acquired in Haran, and they departed to go into the land of Canaan. So they came into the land of Canaan.

6. And Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanites were then in the land.

7. And Jehovah appeared to Abram and said, To your seed I will give this land. And there he built an altar unto Jehovah, who appeared to him.

8. And he moved from there to the mountain east of Bethel, and he pitched his tent with Bethel toward the sea and Ai on the east. There he built an altar unto Jehovah and called upon the name of Jehovah.

9. And Abram journeyed, proceeding to journey toward the south.

10. Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was heavy in the land.

11. And it came to pass, when he was close to entering Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at.

12. And it will happen, when the Egyptians see you, that they will say, This is his wife; and they will kill me, but they will let you live.

13. Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and my soul shall live because of you.

14. And it came to pass when Abram came into Egypt, that the Egyptians saw the woman, that she was very beautiful.

15. The princes of Pharaoh also saw her and commended her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaohs house.

16. He dealt well with Abram because of her; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male and female servants, female donkeys, and camels.

17. And Jehovah struck Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of the matter of Sarai, Abrams wife.

18. And Pharaoh summoned Abram and said, What is this that you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?

19. Why did you say, She is my sister? And so I took her to be my wife. Now therefore, here is your wife; take her and depart.

20. And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him; and they sent him away, with his wife and all that he had.

## Genesis 13

1. And Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South.

2. And Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.

3. And he went on his journey from the South as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,

4. to the place of the altar which he had made there at first. And there Abram called upon the name of Jehovah.

5. Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks and herds and tents.

6. And the land was not able to support them, that they might dwell together, for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together.

7. And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abrams livestock and the herdsmen of Lots livestock. The Canaanites and the Perizzites then dwelt in the land.

8. And Abram said to Lot, Please let there be no strife between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we men are brothers.

9. Is not the whole land before you? Please separate from me. If you take the left, then I will go to the right; or, if you go to the right, then I will go to the left.

10. And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the area around Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere (before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah) like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt as you go toward Zoar.

11. Then Lot chose for himself all the area around Jordan, and Lot journeyed east. And they separated each from the other.

12. Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt around the cities, and pitched his tent even as far as Sodom.

13. But the men of Sodom were exceedingly evil and sinful before Jehovah.

14. And after Lot had separated from him, Jehovah said to Abram: Lift up your eyes now and look from the place where you are, northward, southward, eastward, and westward;

15. for all the land which you see I give to you and your seed in perpetuity.

16. And I will make your seed as the dust of the earth; so that if a man could count the dust of the earth, then your seed also could be numbered.

17. Arise, walk in the land through its length and its width, for I give it to you.

18. Then Abram moved his tent, and went and dwelt by the plain of Mamre in Hebron, and built an altar there unto Jehovah.

## Genesis 14

1. And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations,

2. that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (which is Zoar).

3. All these joined together in the Valley of Siddim (which is the Salt Sea).

4. Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.

5. In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him came and struck the giants in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh Kirjathaim,

6. and the Horites in their mountains of Seir, as far as El Paran, which is by the wilderness.

7. Then they turned back and came to En Mishpat (which is Kadesh), and struck all the land of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who dwelt in Hazezon Tamar.

8. And the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (which is Zoar) went out and set in battle array in the Valley of Siddim

9. against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of nations, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against five.

10. Now the Valley of Siddim was pitted with asphalt pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled; some fell there, and the remainder fled to the mountains.

11. And they took all the property of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way.

12. They also took Lot, the son of Abrams brother, who dwelt in Sodom, and his possessions, and departed.

13. And one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, for he dwelt by the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner; and they were allies with Abram.

14. And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led out his trained three hundred and eighteen who were born in his own house, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.

15. And they split up by night, he and his servants, and struck them and pursued them as far as Hobah, which is north of Damascus.

16. And he brought back all the property, and also brought back his brother Lot and his possessions, as well as the women and the people.

17. And the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (which is the Kings Valley), after his return from smiting Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him.

18. And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine; and he was the priest of the Most High God.

19. And he blessed him and said: Blessed is Abram of the Most High God, Possessor of Heaven and earth;

20. and blessed is the Most High God, who has delivered your enemies into your hand. And he gave him a tithe of all.

21. And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the souls, and take the property for yourself.

22. But Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have raised my hand to Jehovah the Most High God, possessor of the heavens and earth,

23. that I will take nothing, from a thread to a sandal strap, and that I will not take anything that is yours, that you may not say, I have made Abram rich;

24. except only what the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.

## Genesis 15

1. After these things the Word of Jehovah came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.

2. And Abram said, Lord Jehovah, what will You give me, seeing I go childless, and the son of the inheritance of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?

3. And Abram said, Behold, You have given me no seed; and lo, a son of my house inherits from me.

4. And behold, the Word of Jehovah came unto him, saying, This one shall not inherit from you, but one who shall come forth from your own body shall inherit from you.

5. And He brought him outside and said, Look now toward the heavens, and count the stars if you are able to number them. And He said unto him, So shall your seed be.

6. And he believed in Jehovah, and He accounted it unto him for righteousness.

7. And He said unto him, I am Jehovah, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to inherit it.

8. And he said, Lord Jehovah, how shall I know that I shall inherit it?

9. And He said unto him, Take for Me a three year old heifer, a three year old female goat, a three year old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.

10. And he took all these for Him and cut them in two, down the middle, and put each piece against each other; but he did not cut the birds in two.

11. And when the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, Abram drove them away.

12. And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold, terror and great darkness fell upon him.

13. And He said to Abram: Consider to know that your seed shall be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years.

14. And I will also judge the nation whom they serve; and afterward they shall come out with great possessions.

15. And as for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried at a good old age.

16. But in the fourth generation they shall return here; for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.

17. And it came to pass, when the sun had gone down and it was dark, that behold, there appeared a smoking oven and a burning torch that passed between those pieces.

18. On that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram, saying: To your seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the River Euphrates;

19. the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,

20. the Hittites, the Perizzites, the giants,

21. the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.

## Genesis 16

1. Now Sarai, Abrams wife, had borne him no children. And she had an Egyptian maidservant whose name was Hagar.

2. And Sarai said to Abram, See now, Jehovah has restrained me from bearing. Please, go in to my maid; perhaps I shall build up a family by her. And Abram heeded the voice of Sarai.

3. And Sarai, Abrams wife, took Hagar her maidservant, the Egyptian, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan.

4. And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

5. And Sarai said to Abram, My injustice be upon you! I gave my maid into your bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. Jehovah judge between me and you.

6. But Abram said to Sarai, Behold, your maid is in your hand; do to her as is good in your eyes. And when Sarai dealt harshly with her, she fled from her presence.

7. And the Angel of Jehovah found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur.

8. And He said, Hagar, Sarais maidservant, where have you come from, and where are you going? She said, I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai.

9. And the Angel of Jehovah said to her, Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under her hand.

10. And the Angel of Jehovah said unto her, I will multiply your seed exceedingly, so that they shall not be numbered for multitude.

11. And the Angel of Jehovah said unto her: Behold, you are with child, and you shall bear a son. You shall call his name Ishmael, because Jehovah has heard your affliction.

12. He shall be a wild ass of a man; his hand shall be against every man, and every mans hand against him. And he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.

13. And she called the name of Jehovah who spoke to her, God-Who-Sees; for she said, Have I also here looked upon Him who sees me?

14. Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi. Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.

15. And Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.

16. And Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.

## Genesis 17

1. And when Abram was ninety-nine years old, Jehovah appeared to Abram and said to him, I am the Almighty God! Walk before Me and be perfect;

2. and I will make My covenant between Me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly abundantly.

3. And Abram fell on his face, and God spoke with him, saying:

4. As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, and you shall be a father of many nations.

5. No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you a father of many nations.

6. I will make you abundantly exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come forth from you.

7. And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your seed after you in their generations, for a perpetual covenant, to be God unto you and unto your seed after you.

8. Also I have given unto you and your seed after you the land in which you sojourn, all the land of Canaan, as an enduring possession; and I will be their God.

9. And God said to Abraham: As for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your seed after you throughout their generations.

10. This is My covenant which you shall keep, between Me and you and your seed after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised;

11. and you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant between Me and you.

12. He who is eight days old among you shall be circumcised, every male in your generations, he who is born in the house or bought with money from any son of a foreigner who is not your seed.

13. He who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money must be circumcised, and My covenant shall be in your flesh for a perpetual covenant.

14. And the uncircumcised male, who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.

15. Then God said to Abraham, As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name.

16. And I have blessed her and have given you a son by her; yea, I have blessed her, and she shall become nations; kings of peoples shall be from her.

17. Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall one be born to a man who is one hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth?

18. And Abraham said to God, Oh, that Ishmael might live before You!

19. And God said: Truly, Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; I have established My covenant with him for a perpetual covenant, with his seed after him.

20. And as for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly abundantly. He shall beget twelve chiefs, and I will make him a great nation.

21. But My covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this set time next year.

22. And He finished talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.

23. And Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abrahams house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskins the same day, as God had spoken unto him.

24. And Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

25. And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

26. In the same day Abraham was circumcised, along with his son Ishmael;

27. and all the men of his house, born in the house or bought with money from the son of a foreigner, were circumcised with him.

## Genesis 18

1. And Jehovah appeared to him in the plains of Mamre, as he was sitting in the tent opening in the heat of the day.

2. And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing by him; and when he saw them, he ran from the tent opening to meet them, and bowed himself to the ground,

3. and said, My Lord, if I have now found favor in Your eyes, do not pass on by Your servant.

4. Please let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.

5. And I will bring a morsel of bread, that you may strengthen your hearts. After that you may pass on, for this is why you have passed along by your servant. They said, Do as you have said.

6. So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, Quickly, make ready three measures of fine meal; knead it and make cakes.

7. And Abraham ran to the herd, took a tender and good calf, gave it to a young man, and he hastened to prepare it.

8. And he took butter and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree. And they ate.

9. And they said to him, Where is Sarah your wife? So he said, Here, in the tent.

10. And He said, I will come back to return to you according to the time of life, and behold, Sarah your wife shall have a son. And Sarah was listening from the tent opening which was behind him.

11. Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age; and it had ceased to be after the manner of women with Sarah.

12. Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, Being worn out, shall I be delighted, my lord, having also become old?

13. And Jehovah said to Abraham, Why has Sarah laughed, saying, Shall I surely give birth, I who have become old?

14. Is anything beyond the power of Jehovah? At the appointed time I will return to you, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.

15. But Sarah denied it, saying, I did not laugh, for she was afraid. And He said, No, but you did laugh.

16. And the men rose up from there and looked toward Sodom, and Abraham went with them to send them on the way.

17. And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing,

18. since Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?

19. For I have known him, in order that he may command his children and his house after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice, that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham what He has spoken to him.

20. And Jehovah said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and their sin is exceedingly heavy.

21. I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry against it that has come to Me; and if not, I will know.

22. And the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before Jehovah.

23. And Abraham approached and said, Would You also sweep away the righteous with the wicked?

24. Suppose there were fifty righteous within the city; would You also destroy the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous that were in it?

25. Far be it from You to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the wicked; far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?

26. And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

27. Then Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I who am but dust and ashes have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord:

28. Suppose there were five less than the fifty righteous; would You destroy all of the city for lack of five? And He said, If I find forty-five there, I will not destroy it.

29. And he spoke to Him yet again and said, Suppose there should be forty found there? And He said, I will not do it for the sake of forty.

30. Then he said, Let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Suppose thirty should be found there? And He said, I will not do it if I find thirty there.

31. And he said, Indeed now, I have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord: Suppose twenty should be found there? And He said, I will not destroy it for the sake of twenty.

32. And he said, Let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak but once more: Suppose ten should be found there? And He said, I will not destroy it for the sake of ten.

33. And Jehovah went His way as soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham; and Abraham returned to his place.

## Genesis 19

1. And the two angels came to Sodom at evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.

2. And he said, Here now, my lords, please turn in to your servants house and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise early and go on your way. And they said, No, but we will spend the night in the open square.

3. But he insisted strongly; so they turned in to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.

4. But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both old and young, all the people from every quarter, surrounded the house.

5. And they called to Lot and said to him, Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may know them.

6. And Lot went out to them at the entrance and shut the door behind him,

7. and said, Please, my brethren, do not do so wickedly.

8. See now, I have two daughters who have not known a man; please, let me bring them out to you, and do to them as is good in your eyes; only do nothing to these men, since this is the reason they have come under the shadow of my roof.

9. And they said, Stand back! And they said, This one came in to sojourn, and he acts as a judge to condemn; now we will deal worse with you than with them. And they pressed hard against the man Lot, and came near to break down the door.

10. But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them, and shut the door.

11. And they struck the men who were at the entrance of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they became weary trying to find the door.

12. And the men said to Lot, Have you anyone else here? Son-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whomever you have in the city; bring them out of this place!

13. For we are destroying this place, because the outcry against them has grown great before the face of Jehovah, and Jehovah has sent us to destroy it.

14. And Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who had married his daughters, and said, Get up, get out of this place; for Jehovah is destroying this city! But to his sons-in-law he seemed to be joking.

15. And when dawn had risen, the angels urged Lot, saying, Arise, take your wife and your two daughters who are found here, that you not be consumed in the punishment of the city.

16. And while he lingered, the men took hold of his hand, his wifes hand, and the hands of his two daughters, Jehovah being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him down outside the city.

17. And it came to pass, when they had brought them outside, that he said, Escape for your lives! Do not look behind you nor stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be destroyed.

18. And Lot said to them, Please, no, my lords!

19. Behold now, your servant has found favor in your eyes, and you have increased your mercy which you have shown me by saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountains, lest some evil overtake me and I die.

20. See now, this city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one; please let me escape there (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.

21. And he said to him, See, I have favored you concerning this thing also, in that I will not overthrow this city for which you have spoken.

22. Hurry, escape there! For I cannot do anything until you arrive there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

23. The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot entered Zoar.

24. Then Jehovah rained brimstone and fire upon Sodom and Gomorrah, from Jehovah out of the heavens.

25. And He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and the plants of the ground.

26. But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.

27. And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Jehovah.

28. And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain; and he saw, and behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace.

29. And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot had dwelt.

30. And Lot went up out of Zoar and dwelt in the mountains, and his two daughters were with him; for he was afraid to dwell in Zoar. And he and his two daughters dwelt in a cave.

31. And the firstborn said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is no man on the earth to come in to us as is the manner of all the earth.

32. Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may keep alive the seed of our father.

33. And they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.

34. And it happened on the next day that the firstborn said to the younger, Behold, I lay with my father last night; let us make him drink wine tonight also, and you go in and lie with him, that we may keep alive the seed of our father.

35. And they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.

36. Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father.

37. And the firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab; he is the father of the Moabites to this day.

38. And the younger also bore a son and called his name Ben-Ammi; he is the father of the people of Ammon to this day.

## Genesis 20

1. And Abraham journeyed from there to the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.

2. And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister. And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.

3. But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is married to a husband.

4. But Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, Lord, will You slay a righteous nation also?

5. Did he not say to me, She is my sister? And she, even she herself said, He is my brother. In the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands I have done this.

6. And God said to him in a dream, Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart. For I also withheld you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her.

7. Now therefore, restore the mans wife; for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you shall live. But if you do not restore her, know that you shall die the death, you and all who are yours.

8. So Abimelech rose early in the morning, summoned all his servants, and told all these things in their ears; and the men were greatly afraid.

9. And Abimelech summoned Abraham and said to him, What have you done to us? How have I offended you, that you have brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done.

10. And Abimelech said to Abraham, What did you see, that you have done this thing?

11. And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will kill me on account of my wife.

12. And yet she is truly my sister. She is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.

13. And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my fathers house, that I said to her, This is your kindness which you shall do for me: in every place, wherever we go, say of me, He is my brother.

14. And Abimelech took sheep, oxen, and male and female servants, and gave them to Abraham; and he restored Sarah his wife to him.

15. And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you.

16. And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver; indeed this vindicates you before all who are with you and before everybody. Thus she was rebuked.

17. So Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants. Then they gave birth;

18. for Jehovah had closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, the wife of Abraham.

## Genesis 21

1. And Jehovah visited Sarah as He had said, and Jehovah did for Sarah as He had spoken.

2. For Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.

3. And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah had borne to him, Isaac.

4. And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.

5. And Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.

6. And Sarah said, God has made laughter for me, and all who hear will laugh with me.

7. She also said, Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would suckle a son? For I have borne him a son in his old age.

8. And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the same day that Isaac was weaned.

9. And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, playing.

10. Therefore she said to Abraham, Drive away this maidservant and her son; for the son of this maidservant shall not inherit with my son, with Isaac.

11. And the matter caused Abrahams eyes to quiver greatly because of his son.

12. And God said to Abraham, Do not let your eyes quiver because of the lad or because of your maidservant. Whatever Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice; for in Isaac your Seed shall be called.

13. And I will also make a nation of the son of the maidservant, because he is your seed.

14. And Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water; and putting it on her shoulder, he gave it and the boy to Hagar, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.

15. And the water in the skin was used up, and she placed the boy under one of the shrubs.

16. And she went and sat down across from him at a distance of about a bowshot; for she said to herself, Let me not see the death of the boy. So she sat opposite him, and lifted her voice and wept.

17. And God heard the voice of the lad. And the Angel of God called to Hagar out of the heavens, and said to her, What ails you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.

18. Arise, lift up the lad and support him with your hand, for I will make of him a great nation.

19. And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water, and gave the lad to drink.

20. And God was with the lad; and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness, and became a great archer.

21. And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.

22. And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with you in all that you do.

23. Now therefore, swear to me by God that you will not deal falsely with me, with my offspring, or with my posterity; but that according to the kindness that I have done to you, you will do to me and to the land in which you have sojourned.

24. And Abraham said, I will swear.

25. But Abraham rebuked Abimelech because of a well of water which Abimelechs servants had seized.

26. And Abimelech said, I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, nor had I heard of it until today.

27. And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a covenant.

28. And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

29. And Abimelech asked Abraham, What are these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves?

30. And he said, You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that they may be my witness that I have dug this well.

31. Therefore he called that place Beer-sheba, because the two of them swore an oath there.

32. Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. So Abimelech rose with Phicol, the commander of his army, and they returned to the land of the Philistines.

33. And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and there he called upon the name of Jehovah, the Eternal God.

34. And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.

## Genesis 22

1. And it came to pass after these things that God tested Abraham, and said to him, Abraham! And he said, Here am I.

2. And He said, Take now your son, your only one Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.

3. And Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.

4. And on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from a distance.

5. And Abraham said to his young men, Stay here with the donkey; and the lad and I will go over there and do homage, and we will come back to you.

6. And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife, and the two of them went together.

7. And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, My father. And he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

8. And Abraham said, My son, God will provide for Himself the lamb for a burnt offering. So the two of them went together.

9. And they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built an altar there and placed the wood in order; and he bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.

10. And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.

11. And the Angel of Jehovah called to him from the heavens and said, Abraham! Abraham! And he said, Here am I.

12. And He said, Do not lay your hand upon the lad, or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only one from Me.

13. And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and there behind him was a ram caught in a thicket by its horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up for a burnt offering instead of his son.

14. And Abraham called the name of the place, Jehovah Jireh; as it is said to this day, In the Mount of Jehovah it shall be seen.

15. And the Angel of Jehovah called to Abraham a second time out of the heavens,

16. and said: By Myself I have sworn, says Jehovah, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only one;

17. that in blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore. And your Seed shall possess the gate of His enemies.

18. And in your Seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.

19. So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.

20. And it came to pass after these things that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor:

21. Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,

22. Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.

23. And Bethuel begot Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abrahams brother.

24. And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Thahash, and Maachah.

## Genesis 23

1. Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years; these were the years of the life of Sarah.

2. And Sarah died in Kirjath Arba (which is Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.

3. And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,

4. I am a foreigner and a sojourner among you. Give me property for a burial place among you, that I may bury my dead from before my face.

5. And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,

6. Hear us, my lord: You are a Godly prince among us; bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places. None of us will withhold from you his burial place, that you may bury your dead.

7. And Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, the sons of Heth.

8. And he spoke with them, saying, If it is your wish that I bury my dead from before my face, hear me, and entreat Ephron the son of Zohar for me,

9. that he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he has, which is at the end of his field. Let him give it to me at the full price, as property for a burial place among you.

10. And Ephron was sitting among the sons of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the ears of the sons of Heth, all who entered at the gate of his city, saying,

11. No, my lord, hear me: I give you the field and the cave that is in it; I give it to you before the eyes of the sons of my people. I give it to you. Bury your dead.

12. And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land;

13. and he spoke to Ephron in the ears of the people of the land, saying, If you will give it, please hear me. I will give you money for the field; take it from me and I will bury my dead there.

14. And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,

15. My lord, listen to me; the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver. What is that between you and me? So bury your dead.

16. And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed out the silver to Ephron which he had spoken in the ears of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, currency of the merchants.

17. And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field and the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, which were within all the surrounding borders, were deeded

18. to Abraham as a possession before the eyes of the sons of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.

19. And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre (which is Hebron) in the land of Canaan.

20. And the field and the cave that is in it were deeded to Abraham by the sons of Heth as property for a burial place.

## Genesis 24

1. Now Abraham was old, well advanced in age; and Jehovah had blessed Abraham in all things.

2. And Abraham said to the oldest servant of his house, who ruled over all that he had, Please, put your hand under my thigh,

3. and I will make you swear by Jehovah the God of the Heavens and God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell;

4. but you shall go to my land and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.

5. And the servant said to him, Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land; must I take your son back to the land from which you came?

6. And Abraham said to him, Beware that you do not take my son back there.

7. Jehovah the God of Heaven, who took me from my fathers house and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me and swore to me, saying, To your seed I give this land, He will send His Angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.

8. And if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you have been released from this oath; only, do not take my son back there.

9. So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.

10. And the servant took ten of his masters camels and departed, for all his masters goods were in his hand. And he arose and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.

11. And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by a well of water at evening time, the time when women go out to draw.

12. And he said, O Jehovah the God of my master Abraham, please cause the meeting before me this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.

13. Behold, here I stand by the well of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.

14. Now let it be that the young woman to whom I shall say, Please let down your pitcher that I may drink, and she says, Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink; let her be the one You have appointed for Your servant Isaac. And by this I shall know that You have shown kindness to my master.

15. And it happened, before he had finished speaking, that behold, Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abrahams brother, came out with her pitcher on her shoulder.

16. And the young woman was of a very pleasant appearance, a virgin; no man had known her. And she went down to the well, filled her pitcher, and came up.

17. And the servant ran to meet her and said, Please let me drink a little water from your pitcher.

18. And she said, Drink, my lord. Then she quickly let her pitcher down to her hand, and gave him a drink.

19. And when she had finished giving him a drink, she said, I will draw water for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.

20. And she quickly emptied her pitcher into the trough, ran back to the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.

21. And the man, gazing at her, remained silent so as to know whether Jehovah had prospered his journey or not.

22. And it came to pass, when the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a golden ring weighing half a shekel, and two bracelets for her hands weighing ten shekels of gold,

23. and said, Whose daughter are you? Tell me, please, is there room in your fathers house for us to lodge?

24. And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel, Milcahs son, whom she bore to Nahor.

25. Moreover she said to him, We have both straw and feed enough, and room to lodge.

26. And the man bowed down and prostrated himself before Jehovah.

27. And he said, Blessed be Jehovah the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken His goodness and His truth toward my master. As for me, being on the way, Jehovah has led me to the house of my masters brethren.

28. And the girl ran and told these things in the house of her mother.

29. And Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban, and Laban ran out to the man by the well.

30. And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sisters hands, and when he heard the words of his sister Rebekah, saying, Thus the man spoke to me, that he went to the man. And there he stood by the camels at the well.

31. And he said, Come in, O blessed of Jehovah! Why do you stand outside? I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels.

32. And the man came into the house. And he unloaded the camels, and provided straw and feed for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.

33. And food was set before him to eat, but he said, I will not eat until I have spoken my business. And he said, Speak.

34. And he said, I am Abrahams servant.

35. Jehovah has blessed my master greatly, and he has become great; and He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male and female servants, and camels and donkeys.

36. And Sarah my masters wife bore a son to my master when she was old; and to him he has given all that he has.

37. And my master made me swear, saying, You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell;

38. but you shall go to my fathers house and to my family, and take a wife for my son.

39. And I said to my master, Perhaps the woman will not follow me.

40. And he said to me, Jehovah, before whom I walk, will send His Angel with you and prosper your way; and you shall take a wife for my son from my family and from my fathers house.

41. Then you shall be free from this oath when you come to my family; and if they will not give her to you, then you will be released from my oath.

42. And this day I came to the well and said, O Jehovah the God of my master Abraham, if You will now prosper the way in which I go,

43. behold, I am standing by the well of water; and it shall come to pass that when the virgin comes out to draw water, and I say to her, Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,

44. and she says to me, Drink, and I will draw for your camels also; let her be the woman whom Jehovah has appointed for my masters son.

45. And before I had finished speaking in my heart, there was Rebekah, coming out with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the well and drew water. And I said to her, Please let me drink.

46. And she made haste and let her pitcher down from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give your camels water also. So I drank, and she gave the camels water also.

47. Then I asked her, and said, Whose daughter are you? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahors son, whom Milcah bore to him. And I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her hands.

48. And I bowed and prostrated myself before Jehovah, and blessed Jehovah the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the way of truth to take the daughter of my masters brother for his son.

49. And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. And if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.

50. Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing has come forth from Jehovah; we cannot speak to you either bad or good.

51. Behold, Rebekah is before you; take her and go, and let her be your masters sons wife, as Jehovah has spoken.

52. And it came to pass, when Abrahams servant heard their words, that he prostrated himself to the earth before Jehovah.

53. And the servant brought out articles of silver, articles of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother.

54. And he and the men who were with him ate and drank and stayed the night. And they arose in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master.

55. And her brother and her mother said, Let the girl stay with us perhaps ten days; after that she may go.

56. And he said to them, Do not delay me, since Jehovah has prospered my way; send me away so that I may go to my master.

57. So they said, We will call the girl and ask at her mouth.

58. And they called Rebekah and said to her, Will you go with this man? And she said, I will go.

59. And they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse, and Abrahams servant and his men.

60. And they blessed Rebekah and said to her: Our sister, may you become the mother of thousands of ten thousands; and may your seed possess the gates of those who hate them.

61. And Rebekah and her maids arose, and they rode on the camels and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and departed.

62. And Isaac came from the gates of Beer Lahai Roi, for he dwelt in the land toward the south.

63. And Isaac went out to meditate in the field in the evening; and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, the camels were coming.

64. And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac she dismounted from her camel;

65. for she had said to the servant, Who is this man walking in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master. Therefore she took a veil and covered herself.

66. And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.

67. And Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah; and he took Rebekah and she became his wife, and he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after his mothers death.

## Genesis 25

1. Then Abraham again took a wife, and her name was Keturah.

2. And she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.

3. Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.

4. And the sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the sons of Keturah.

5. And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.

6. But Abraham gave gifts to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had; and while he was still living he sent them eastward, away from Isaac his son, to the lands to the east.

7. These are the days of the years of Abrahams life which he lived: one hundred and seventy-five years.

8. Then Abraham expired and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his people.

9. And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite,

10. the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife.

11. And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac dwelt at Beer Lahai Roi.

12. Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abrahams son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarahs maidservant, bore to Abraham.

13. And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: The firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,

14. Mishma, Dumah, Massa,

15. Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.

16. These were the sons of Ishmael and these were their names, by their villages and their encampments, twelve chiefs according to their nations.

17. And these were the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred and thirty-seven years; and he expired and died, and was gathered to his people.

18. They settled from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt as you go toward Assyria. He settled in the presence of all his brethren.

19. And these are the generations of Isaac, Abrahams son: Abraham begot Isaac.

20. And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan, the sister of Laban the Aramean, as wife.

21. And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren; and Jehovah was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.

22. But the sons struggled together within her; and she said, If all is right, why am I like this? So she went to inquire of Jehovah.

23. And Jehovah said to her: Two nations are in your womb, two peoples shall be separated from your body; one people shall be stronger than the other, and the older shall serve the younger.

24. So when her days were fulfilled for her to give birth, behold, there were twins in her womb.

25. And the first came out red. He was like a hairy garment all over; and they called his name Esau.

26. Afterward his brother came out, and his hand took hold of Esaus heel; and his name was called Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.

27. So the boys grew: And Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.

28. And Isaac loved Esau because he had a taste for game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.

29. Now Jacob boiled stew; and Esau came in from the field, and he was exhausted.

30. And Esau said to Jacob, Please let me gulp down some of that red, red stew, for I am faint. Therefore his name was called Edom.

31. And Jacob said, Sell me your birthright today.

32. And Esau said, Behold, I am about to die; so what is this birthright to me?

33. And Jacob said, Swear to me this day. So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob.

34. And Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils; and he ate and drank, arose, and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.

## Genesis 26

1. And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.

2. And Jehovah appeared to him and said: Do not go down into Egypt; dwell in the land of which I shall tell you.

3. Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and bless you; for to you and your seed I give all these lands. And I will perform the oath which I swore unto Abraham your father.

4. And I will make your seed multiply as the stars of the heavens; I will give to your seed all these lands; and in your Seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed;

5. because Abraham has obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.

6. And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.

7. And the men of the place asked about his wife. And he said, She is my sister; for he was afraid to say, She is my wife, thinking, Lest the men of the place kill me on account of Rebekah, because she was of a pleasant appearance.

8. And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked through a window and saw, and behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.

9. And Abimelech summoned Isaac and said, Behold, surely she is your wife; so why have you said, She is my sister? And Isaac said to him, Because I thought, Lest I die on account of her.

10. And Abimelech said, What is this you have done to us? One of the people might soon have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.

11. And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He who touches this man or his wife shall die the death.

12. Then Isaac sowed in that land, and got in the same year a hundredfold; and Jehovah blessed him.

13. The man became great, and continued on growing in greatness until he became exceedingly great;

14. for he had possessions of flocks and possessions of herds and a great number of servants. And the Philistines envied him.

15. Now the Philistines had stopped up all the wells which his fathers servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, and they had filled them with dirt.

16. And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go away from us, for you have become much mightier than we.

17. So Isaac departed from there and pitched his tent in the Valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.

18. And Isaac re-dug the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham. And he called them by the names which his father had called them.

19. Isaacs servants also dug in the valley, and found a well of running water there.

20. But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaacs herdsmen, saying, The water is ours. So he called the name of the well Esek, because they had contended with him.

21. And they dug another well, and they strove over that one also. So he called its name Sitnah.

22. And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he called its name Rehoboth, because he said, For now Jehovah has made a large place for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.

23. And he went up from there to Beer-sheba.

24. And Jehovah appeared to him the same night and said, I am the God of your father Abraham; do not fear, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply your seed for My servant Abrahams sake.

25. So he built an altar there and called upon the name of Jehovah. And he pitched his tent there; and there Isaacs servants dug a well.

26. And Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath, one of his friends, and Phicol the commander of his army.

27. And Isaac said to them, Why have you come to me, since you hate me and have sent me away from you?

28. And they said, We have certainly seen that Jehovah is with you. So we said, Let there now be an oath between us, between you and us; and let us make a covenant with you,

29. that you will do us no evil, since we have not touched you, and since we have done nothing to you but good and have sent you away in peace; you being now the blessed of Jehovah.

30. And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.

31. And they arose early in the morning and swore an oath with one another; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.

32. And it came to pass on the same day that Isaacs servants came and told him about the well which they had dug, and said to him, We have found water.

33. And he called it Shebah. Therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.

34. And Esau was forty years old when he took as wives Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.

35. And they were a grief of spirit to Isaac and Rebekah.

## Genesis 27

1. And it came to pass, when Isaac was old and his eyes were so dim that he could not see, that he summoned Esau his older son and said to him, My son. And he answered him, Here am I.

2. And he said, Behold now, I am old. I do not know the day of my death.

3. Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me.

4. And make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, that my soul may bless you before I die.

5. And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt game and to bring it.

6. And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,

7. Bring me game and make savory food for me, that I may eat it and bless you in the presence of Jehovah before my death.

8. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to what I command you.

9. Go now to the flock and bring me from there two choice kids of the goats, and I will make savory food from them for your father, such as he loves.

10. And you shall take it to your father, that he may eat it, and that he may bless you before his death.

11. And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.

12. Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be a deceiver to him; and I shall bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing.

13. And his mother said to him, Let your curse be upon me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, get them for me.

14. And he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and his mother made savory food, such as his father loved.

15. And Rebekah took the good clothes of her elder son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son.

16. And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.

17. And she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.

18. And he went in to his father and said, My father. And he said, Here am I. Who are you, my son?

19. And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau your firstborn; I have done just as you have spoken to me; please arise, sit and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.

20. But Isaac said to his son, How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah your God brought it to me.

21. And Isaac said to Jacob, Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are my very son Esau or not.

22. And Jacob went near to Isaac his father, and he felt him and said, The voice is Jacobs voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.

23. And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esaus hands; so he blessed him.

24. And he said, Are you really my son Esau? And he said, I am.

25. And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my sons game, so that my soul may bless you. So he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.

26. And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now and kiss me, my son.

27. And he came near and kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him and said: Surely, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field which Jehovah has blessed.

28. Therefore, God give you of the dew of the heavens, of the fatness of the earth, and abundance of grain and wine.

29. Let nations serve you, and people bow down to you. Be lord over your brethren, and let your mothers sons bow down to you. Cursed is everyone who curses you, and blessed be those who bless you!

30. And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.

31. And he also had made savory food, and brought it to his father, and said to his father, Let my father arise and eat of his sons game, that your soul may bless me.

32. And his father Isaac said to him, Who are you? So he said, I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.

33. And Isaac trembled with a very great trembling, and said, Who? Where is the one who hunted game and brought it to me? I ate all of it before you came, and I have blessed him; and moreover, he shall be blessed.

34. And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me; me also, O my father!

35. And he said, Your brother came with deceit and has taken away your blessing.

36. And Esau said, Is he not rightly called by the name Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright, and now behold, he has taken away my blessing! And he said, Have you not reserved a blessing for me?

37. Then Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brethren I have given to him as servants; with grain and wine I have sustained him. What shall I do now for you, my son?

38. And Esau said to his father, Have you only one blessing, my father? Bless me; me also, O my father! And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.

39. And Isaac his father answered and said to him: Behold, your dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of the heavens from above.

40. By your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother; and it shall come to pass, when you become restless, that you shall break his yoke from your neck.

41. And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then I will kill my brother Jacob.

42. And the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. So she sent and summoned Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself concerning you by intending to kill you.

43. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice: arise, flee to my brother Laban, to Haran.

44. And stay with him some days, until your brothers fury turns away,

45. until your brothers anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him; then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I be bereaved also of you both in one day?

46. And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, like these daughters of the land, what kind of life is that to me?

## Genesis 28

1. And Isaac summoned Jacob and blessed him, and charged him, and said to him: You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.

2. Arise, go to Paddan, to the house of Bethuel your mothers father; and take yourself a wife from there of the daughters of Laban your mothers brother.

3. May God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful and multiply you, that you may become an assembly of peoples;

4. and give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and your seed with you, that you may inherit the land in which you are a sojourner, which God has given to Abraham.

5. And Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddan, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.

6. And when Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan to take himself a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan,

7. and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Paddan;

8. and Esau also saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the eyes of his father Isaac;

9. that Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abrahams son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife along with the wives he had.

10. And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba and went toward Haran.

11. And he came to a certain place and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. And he took one of the stones of that place and put it at his head, and he lay down in that place to sleep.

12. And he dreamed, and behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, and its top reached to the heavens; and behold the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.

13. And behold, Jehovah stood above it and said: I am Jehovah the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you are lying I give to you and your seed.

14. And your seed shall be as the dust of the earth; you shall spread abroad to the west and the east, to the north and the south; and in you and in your Seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed.

15. Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I am not forsaking you until I have done what I have spoken to you.

16. And Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, Surely Jehovah is in this place, and I did not realize it.

17. And he was afraid and said, How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of Heaven!

18. And Jacob arose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put at his head, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on top of it.

19. And he called the name of that place Bethel; but the name of that city had formerly been Luz.

20. And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and keep me in this way that I am going, and give me bread to eat and clothing to put on,

21. so that I return to my fathers house in peace, then Jehovah shall be my God.

22. And this stone which I have set as a pillar shall be Gods house, and of all that You give me I will tithe to give a tithe to You.

## Genesis 29

1. So Jacob lifted his feet and came into the land of the sons of the East.

2. And he looked, and behold a well in the field; and behold, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks. And a large stone was on the wells mouth.

3. And all the flocks would be gathered there; and they would roll the stone from the wells mouth, water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place on the wells mouth.

4. And Jacob said to them, My brethren, where are you from? And they said, We are from Haran.

5. And he said to them, Do you know Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.

6. And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, He is well. And behold, his daughter Rachel is coming with the sheep.

7. And he said, Behold, it is still high day; it is not the time for cattle to be gathered together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.

8. But they said, We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and they have rolled the stone from the wells mouth; then we water the sheep.

9. And while he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her fathers sheep, for she was tending them.

10. And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mothers brother, and the sheep of Laban his mothers brother, that Jacob went near and rolled the stone from the wells mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mothers brother.

11. And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept.

12. And Jacob told Rachel that he was her fathers relative and that he was Rebekahs son. So she ran and told her father.

13. And it came to pass, when Laban heard the report about Jacob his sisters son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. So he told Laban all these things.

14. And Laban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh. And he stayed with him a month of days.

15. And Laban said to Jacob, Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?

16. Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.

17. Leahs eyes were delicate, but Rachel had a beautiful figure and a beautiful appearance.

18. And Jacob loved Rachel; so he said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.

19. And Laban said, It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.

20. So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they were only a day in his eyes because of the love he had for her.

21. And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my days have been fulfilled.

22. And Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast.

23. And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him; and he went in to her.

24. And Laban gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah as a maidservant.

25. And it came to pass in the morning, that behold, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, What is this you have done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I served you? Why then have you deceived me?

26. And Laban said, It is not done so in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.

27. Fulfill her week, and we will give you this one also for the service which you will serve with me yet another seven years.

28. And Jacob did so and fulfilled her week. So he gave him his daughter Rachel as wife also.

29. And Laban gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as a maidservant.

30. And Jacob also went in to Rachel, and he also loved Rachel more than Leah. And he served with him yet another seven years.

31. When Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, He opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.

32. And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben; for she said, Jehovah has surely looked upon my affliction. Now therefore, my husband will love me.

33. And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, Because Jehovah has heard that I am hated, He has therefore given me this one also. And she called his name Simeon.

34. And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore his name was called Levi.

35. And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, Now I will praise Jehovah. Therefore she called his name Judah. Then she stopped giving birth.

## Genesis 30

1. Now when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel was jealous of her sister, and said to Jacob, Give me sons, or if not I shall die!

2. And Jacobs anger burned against Rachel, and he said, Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?

3. And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah; go in to her, and she shall give birth on my knees, that I also may be built up by her.

4. And she gave him Bilhah her maid as wife, and Jacob went in to her.

5. And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.

6. And Rachel said, God has judged my case, and has also heard my voice and given me a son. Therefore she called his name Dan.

7. And Rachels maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.

8. And Rachel said, With great wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed. So she called his name Naphtali.

9. And when Leah saw that she had stopped giving birth, she took Zilpah her maid and gave her to Jacob as wife.

10. And Leahs maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son.

11. And Leah said, Good fortune has come! So she called his name Gad.

12. And Leahs maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.

13. And Leah said, I am happy, for the daughters shall call me blessed. So she called his name Asher.

14. And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. And Rachel said to Leah, Please give me some of your sons mandrakes.

15. And she said to her, Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my sons mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your sons mandrakes.

16. When Jacob came out of the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, You must come in to me, for hiring I have hired you with my sons mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.

17. And God gave heed to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.

18. And Leah said, God has given me my wages, because I have given my maid to my husband. So she called his name Issachar.

19. And Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son.

20. And Leah said, God has endowed me with a good endowment; this time my husband will dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons. So she called his name Zebulun.

21. And afterward she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah.

22. And God remembered Rachel, and God gave heed to her and opened her womb.

23. And she conceived and bore a son, and said, God has taken away my reproach.

24. So she called his name Joseph, and said, Jehovah shall add to me another son.

25. And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place and to my own land.

26. Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service with which I have served you.

27. And Laban said to him, Please stay, if I have found favor in your eyes, for I have observed the signs that Jehovah has blessed me because of you.

28. And he said, Specify your wages to me, and I will give it.

29. So Jacob said to him, You know how I have served you and how your livestock is with me.

30. For what you had before I came was little, and it has increased into a multitude; Jehovah has blessed you since I stepped foot here. And now, when shall I also provide for my own house?

31. So he said, What shall I give you? And Jacob said, You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will turn back to feed and keep your flocks:

32. Let me pass through all your flock today, removing from there all the speckled and spotted sheep, and all the brown ones among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and these shall be my wages.

33. So my righteousness shall testify for me in time to come, when the subject of my wages comes before you: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the lambs, will be considered stolen, if it is with me.

34. And Laban said, Oh, that it were according to your word!

35. So he removed that day the male goats that were speckled and spotted, all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had some white in it, and all the brown ones among the lambs, and gave them into the hand of his sons.

36. And he put three days journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Labans flocks.

37. And Jacob took for himself rods of green poplar and of the almond and plane trees, peeled white strips in them, and laid bare the white which was in the rods.

38. And the rods which he had peeled, he set before the flocks in the troughs, in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink, so that they should come into heat when they came to drink.

39. And the flocks mated before the rods, and the flocks gave birth to streaked, speckled, and spotted.

40. And Jacob separated the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the streaked and all the brown in the flock of Laban; but he put his own flocks by themselves and did not put them with Labans flock.

41. And it came to pass, whenever the stronger livestock were in heat, that Jacob placed the rods before the eyes of the livestock in the troughs, that they might mate among the rods.

42. And when the flocks were feeble, he did not put them in; so the feebler were Labans and the stronger Jacobs.

43. And the man increased exceedingly greatly, and had many cattle, female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.

## Genesis 31

1. Now Jacob heard the words of Labans sons, saying, Jacob has taken away all that was our fathers, and from what was our fathers he has acquired all this wealth.

2. And Jacob saw the countenance of Laban, and behold, it was not toward him as before.

3. And Jehovah said to Jacob, Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you.

4. So Jacob sent and summoned Rachel and Leah to the field, to his flock,

5. and said to them, I see your fathers countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.

6. And you know that with all my strength I have served your father.

7. Yet your father has deceived me and changed my wages ten times, but God has not allowed him to do evil to me.

8. If he said thus: The speckled shall be your wages, then all the flocks bore speckled. And if he said thus: The streaked shall be your wages, then all the flocks bore streaked.

9. So God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me.

10. And it happened, at the time when the flocks were in heat, that I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams which mounted the flocks were streaked, speckled, and spotted.

11. And the Angel of God spoke to me in a dream, saying, Jacob. And I said, Here am I.

12. And He said, Lift up your eyes now and see, all the rams which mount the flocks are streaked, speckled, and spotted; for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.

13. I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar and where you vowed a vow to Me. Now arise, get out of this land, and return to the land of your kindred.

14. And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our fathers house?

15. Are we not considered foreigners by him? For he has sold us, and also devoured and consumed our money.

16. For all these riches which God has taken from our father are ours and our sons. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do it.

17. Then Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels.

18. And he drove away all his livestock and all his possessions which he had gained, his acquired livestock which he had gained in Paddan, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.

19. And Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel had stolen the household idols that were her fathers.

20. And Jacob stole away, unknown to Laban the Aramean, in that he did not tell him that he was fleeing.

21. So he fled with all that he had. He arose and crossed the river, and set his face toward the mountains of Gilead.

22. And Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled.

23. And he took his brethren with him and pursued him for seven days journey, and he overtook him in the mountains of Gilead.

24. And God come to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night, and said to him, Beware that you not speak to Jacob from good to evil.

25. So Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountains, and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mountains of Gilead.

26. And Laban said to Jacob: What have you done, that you have stolen away unknown to me, and led away my daughters like captives of the sword?

27. Why did you flee away secretly, and steal away from me, and not tell me; for I might have sent you away with joy and songs, with timbrel and harp?

28. And you did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters. Now you have done foolishly in so doing.

29. It is in the power of my hand to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, Beware that you not speak to Jacob from good to evil.

30. And now you have proceeded to depart because you have longed for your fathers house. But why have you stolen my gods?

31. And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid; for I said, Lest you would take your daughters from me by force.

32. With whomever you find your gods, do not let him live. In the presence of our brethren, identify what I have of yours and take it with you. For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.

33. And Laban went into Jacobs tent, into Leahs tent, and into the two maidservants tents, but he did not find them. Then he went out of Leahs tent and entered Rachels tent.

34. Now Rachel had taken the household idols, put them in the camels saddle, and sat on them. And Laban groped all about the tent but did not find them.

35. And she said to her father, Let it not burn in the eyes of my lord that I cannot rise before you, for the manner of women is with me. And he searched but did not find the household idols.

36. And Jacob was furious and complained to Laban, and Jacob answered and said to Laban: What is my transgression? What is my sin, that you have so hotly pursued me?

37. Although you have searched all my things, what of your household articles have you found? Set it here before my brethren and your brethren, that they may judge between us both!

38. These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried their young, and I have not eaten the rams of your flock.

39. That which was torn by beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it. You required it from my hand, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.

40. There I was: In the day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.

41. Thus I have been in your house twenty years; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.

42. Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands, and rebuked you last night.

43. And Laban answered and said to Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks; all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne?

44. Now therefore, come, let us make a covenant, you and me, and let it be a witness between you and me.

45. So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a monument.

46. And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones. And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there on the heap.

47. Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.

48. And Laban said, This heap is a witness between you and me this day. Therefore its name was called Galeed;

49. also, Mizpah; because he said, May Jehovah watch between you and me when we are hidden (being absent) one from another.

50. If you afflict my daughters, or if you take other wives besides my daughters, although no man is with us; consider that God is witness between you and me.

51. And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap and this pillar, which I have cast between me and you:

52. This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a testimony, that I will not pass beyond this heap to you, and you will not pass beyond this heap and this pillar to me, for evil.

53. The God of Abraham, the God of Nahor, and the God of their father judge between us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.

54. And Jacob slaughtered a sacrifice on the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread. And they ate bread and stayed all night on the mountain.

55. And early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his sons and daughters and blessed them. And Laban departed and returned to his place.

## Genesis 32

1. So Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

2. And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is the camp of God. And he called the name of that place Mahanaim.

3. And Jacob sent messengers before his face to Esau his brother in the land of Seir, the land of Edom.

4. And he commanded them, saying, Speak thus to my lord Esau, Thus your servant Jacob says: I have sojourned with Laban and stayed there until now.

5. And I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, and male and female servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.

6. And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother Esau, and he also is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.

7. And Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two companies.

8. For he thought, If Esau comes to the one company and strikes it, then the other company which is left shall escape.

9. And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, Jehovah who said to me, Return to your land and to your kindred, and I will deal well with you:

10. I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the faithfulness which You have done for Your servant; for I crossed over this Jordan with my staff, and now I have become two companies.

11. Rescue me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and strike me, and the mothers to the children.

12. For You said, I will do good to deal well with you, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.

13. And he lodged there that night, and took what came to his hand as a present for Esau his brother:

14. two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,

15. thirty milk camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals.

16. And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, Pass over before me, and put some space from drove to drove.

17. And he commanded the first one, saying, When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, saying, To whom do you belong, and where are you going? Whose are these before you?

18. then you shall say, They are your servant Jacobs. It is a present sent to my lord Esau; and behold, he also is behind us.

19. And he commanded the second, the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, You shall speak these words to Esau when you find him;

20. and also say, Behold, your servant Jacob is behind us. For he thought, I will propitiate before his face with the present that goes before me, and afterward when I shall see his face, perhaps he will forgive me.

21. So the present passed over before him, but he himself remained that night in the camp.

22. And he arose that night and took his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of Jabbok.

23. He took them, sent them over the brook, and sent over what he had.

24. And Jacob was left alone; and a Man wrestled with him until the dawn began to rise.

25. And when He saw that He did not prevail against him, He touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacobs hip was out of joint as He wrestled with him.

26. And He said, Let Me go, for the dawn has risen. But he said, I will not let You go unless You bless me!

27. And He said to him, What is your name? And he said, Jacob.

28. And He said, Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have persevered with God and with men, and have prevailed.

29. And Jacob asked, saying, Please tell me Your name. And He said, Why is it that you ask about My name? And He blessed him there.

30. And Jacob called the name of the place Penuel: For I have seen God face to face, and my soul is delivered.

31. Just as he crossed over Penuel the sun rose over him, and he was limping on his thigh.

32. Therefore to this day the children of Israel do not eat the muscle tendon which is on the hip socket, because He touched the socket of Jacobs hip on the muscle tendon.

## Genesis 33

1. And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and with him were four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants.

2. And he put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph last.

3. And he crossed over in front of them and prostrated himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.

4. And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.

5. And he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and children, and said, Who are these with you? And he said, The children whom God has graciously given your servant.

6. Then the maidservants came near, they and their children, and bowed down.

7. And Leah also came near with her children, and they bowed down. Afterward Joseph and Rachel came near, and they bowed down.

8. And Esau said, What do you mean by all this company which I met? And he said, To find favor in the eyes of my lord.

9. And Esau said, I have abundance, my brother; keep what you have to yourself.

10. And Jacob said, No, please, if I have now found favor in your eyes, then receive my present from my hand, inasmuch as I have seen your face as though I had seen the face of God, and you were pleased with me.

11. Please, take my blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have everything I need. So he urged him, and he took it.

12. And Esau said, Let us take our journey; let us go, and I will go before you.

13. But Jacob said to him, My lord knows that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds which are nursing are with me. And if the men should drive them hard one day, all the flock will die.

14. Please let my lord go on ahead before his servant. I will lead on gently according to the pace of the livestock that go before me, and the feet of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.

15. And Esau said, Now let me leave with you some of the people who are with me. But he said, What need is there? Let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.

16. So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.

17. And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, built himself a house, and made booths for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.

18. And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan; and he pitched his tent before the city.

19. And he bought the parcel of land where he had pitched his tent, from the hand of the sons of Hamor, Shechems father, for one hundred pieces of money.

20. And he set up an altar there, and called it, El Elohe Israel.

## Genesis 34

1. Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.

2. And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, chief of the land, saw her, he took her and lay with her, and humbled her.

3. And his soul clung to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke to the heart of the girl.

4. And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Get this girl for me as a wife.

5. And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter. Now his sons were with his livestock in the field; so Jacob held his peace until they came.

6. And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him.

7. And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it; and the men were grieved and extremely furious, because he had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by lying with Jacobs daughter, a thing which ought not to be done.

8. And Hamor spoke with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife.

9. And make marriages with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to yourselves.

10. And you shall dwell with us, and the land is before you. Dwell and trade in it, and acquire possessions in it.

11. And Shechem said to her father and her brothers, Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give.

12. Ask me ever so much dowry and gift, and I will give according to what you say to me; but give me the girl as a wife.

13. And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father, and spoke deceitfully, because he had defiled Dinah their sister;

14. and they said to them: We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised, for that would be a reproach to us.

15. But on this condition we will consent to you: If you will become as we are, if every male of you is circumcised,

16. then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us; and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.

17. But if you will not heed us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and be gone.

18. And their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamors son.

19. And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacobs daughter. He was more honorable than all the house of his father.

20. And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and spoke with the men of their city, saying:

21. These men are peaceable with us. Therefore let them dwell in the land and trade in it. For indeed the land is wide of hands before them. Let us take their daughters to us as wives, and let us give our daughters to them.

22. Only on this condition will the men consent to dwell with us, to be one people: if every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised.

23. Shall not their livestock, their property, and every animal of theirs be ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.

24. And all those going out of the gate of his city heeded Hamor and Shechem his son; every male was circumcised, all those going out of the gate of his city.

25. And it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinahs brothers, each took his sword and came upon the city in its security and killed every male.

26. And they killed Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and fetched Dinah from Shechems house, and went out.

27. The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.

28. They took their sheep, their oxen, and their donkeys, what was in the city and what was in the field.

29. All their wealth, all their little ones and their wives they took captive; and they plundered even all that was in the houses.

30. And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have troubled me by making me odious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and since I am few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and kill me. I shall be destroyed, my house and I.

31. And they said, Should he treat our sister like a harlot?

## Genesis 35

1. And God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there; and make an altar there to the Mighty God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother.

2. And Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, and change your garments.

3. Let us arise and go up to Bethel; and I will make an altar there to the Mighty God, who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me in the way which I have gone.

4. So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the terebinth tree which was by Shechem.

5. And they journeyed, and the terror of God was upon the cities all around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.

6. So Jacob came to Luz (which is Bethel), in the land of Canaan, he and all the people with him.

7. And he built an altar there and called the place El Bethel, because there God had revealed Himself to him when he fled from the face of his brother.

8. Now Deborah, Rebekahs nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak tree. So the name of it was called Allon Bachuth.

9. And God appeared to Jacob again, when he came out of Paddan, and blessed him.

10. And God said to him, Your name is Jacob; your name shall not be called Jacob anymore, but Israel shall be your name. And He called his name Israel.

11. God also said to him: I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall proceed from you, and kings shall come forth from your loins.

12. The land which I gave Abraham and Isaac I give to you; and to your seed after you I give this land.

13. And God ascended from him in the place where He had spoken with him.

14. And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He had spoken with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured a drink offering on it, and he poured oil on it.

15. And Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him, Bethel.

16. And they journeyed from Bethel. And when there was still some ground to cover to arrive at Ephrath, Rachel was giving birth, and she had hard labor.

17. And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, Do not fear; you shall have this son also.

18. And so it was, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-Oni; but his father called him Benjamin.

19. And Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (which is Bethlehem).

20. And Jacob set a pillar on her grave, which is the pillar of Rachels grave to this day.

21. And Israel journeyed and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder.

22. And it happened, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his fathers concubine; and Israel heard about it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:

23. the sons of Leah were Reuben, Jacobs firstborn, and Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun;

24. the sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin;

25. the sons of Bilhah, Rachels maidservant, were Dan and Naphtali;

26. and the sons of Zilpah, Leahs maidservant, were Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan.

27. And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, to the city of Arba (which is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.

28. And the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years.

29. And Isaac expired and died, and was gathered to his people, being old and fulfilled in days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.

## Genesis 36

1. Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.

2. Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite; Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;

3. and Basemath, Ishmaels daughter, sister of Nebajoth.

4. Now Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and Basemath bore Reuel.

5. And Aholibamah bore Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. These were the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.

6. And Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the souls of his house, his cattle and all his animals, and all his possessions which he had gained in the land of Canaan, and went to a land away from the presence of his brother Jacob.

7. For their possessions were too great for them to dwell together, and the land where they were sojourners could not support them because of their livestock.

8. So Esau dwelt in Mount Seir. Esau is Edom.

9. And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in Mount Seir.

10. These were the names of Esaus sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, and Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau.

11. And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.

12. And Timna was a concubine to Eliphaz, Esaus son, and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These were the sons of Adah, Esaus wife.

13. These were the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Basemath, Esaus wife.

14. These were the sons of Aholibamah, Esaus wife, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon. And she bore to Esau: Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah.

15. These were the chiefs of the sons of Esau: The sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn son of Esau, were Chief Teman, Chief Omar, Chief Zepho, Chief Kenaz,

16. Chief Korah, Chief Gatam, and Chief Amalek. These were the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom. These were the sons of Adah.

17. These were the sons of Reuel, Esaus son: Chief Nahath, Chief Zerah, Chief Shammah, and Chief Mizzah. These were the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom. These were the sons of Basemath, Esaus wife.

18. And these were the sons of Aholibamah, Esaus wife: Chief Jeush, Chief Jaalam, and Chief Korah. These were the chiefs from Aholibamah, Esaus wife, the daughter of Anah.

19. These were the sons of Esau, who is Edom; and these were their chiefs.

20. These were the sons of Seir the Horite who dwelt in the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,

21. Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These were the chiefs of the Horites, the sons of Seir, in the land of Edom.

22. And the sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam. Lotans sister was Timna.

23. These were the sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.

24. These were the sons of Zibeon: both Ajah and Anah. This was the Anah who found the water in the wilderness as he pastured the donkeys of his father Zibeon.

25. These were the children of Anah: Dishon and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.

26. These were the sons of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.

27. These were the sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.

28. These were the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran.

29. These were the chiefs of the Horites: Chief Lotan, Chief Shobal, Chief Zibeon, Chief Anah,

30. Chief Dishon, Chief Ezer, and Chief Dishan. These were the chiefs of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir.

31. Now these were the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the children of Israel:

32. Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah.

33. And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his place.

34. And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his place.

35. And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who struck Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his place; and the name of his city was Avith.

36. And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his place.

37. And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the River reigned in his place.

38. And Saul died, and Baal-Hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his place.

39. And Baal-Hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his place; and the name of his city was Pau; his wifes name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.

40. And these were the names of the chiefs of Esau, according to their families and their places, by their names: Chief Timnah, Chief Alvah, Chief Jetheth,

41. Chief Aholibamah, Chief Elah, Chief Pinon,

42. Chief Kenaz, Chief Teman, Chief Mibzar,

43. Chief Magdiel, and Chief Iram. These were the chiefs of Edom, according to their dwelling places in the land of their possession. Esau was the father of the Edomites.

## Genesis 37

1. Now Jacob dwelt in the land where his father was a sojourner, in the land of Canaan.

2. These are the generations of Jacob: Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. And the lad was with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his fathers wives; and Joseph brought an evil report of them to his father.

3. Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a tunic reaching to the soles of his feet.

4. But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peaceably to him.

5. And Joseph had a dream, and he told it to his brothers; and they hated him even more.

6. And he said to them, Please hear this dream which I have dreamed:

7. For behold, we were binding sheaves in the field. Then behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves stood all around and bowed down to my sheaf.

8. And his brothers said to him, Shall you indeed become king over us? Or shall you indeed rule over us? So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.

9. Then he dreamed yet another dream and told it to his brothers, and said, Behold, I have dreamed another dream: and behold, the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars bowed down to me.

10. And he told it to his father and his brothers; and his father rebuked him and said to him, What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall it come to pass that your mother and I and your brothers indeed come to prostrate ourselves to the earth before you?

11. And his brothers were jealous of him; but his father treasured up these words.

12. And his brothers went to feed their fathers flock in Shechem.

13. And Israel said to Joseph, Are not your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, I will send you to them. And he said to him, Here I am.

14. And he said to him, Please go and see if it is well with your brothers and well with the flocks, and bring back word to me. So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.

15. And a certain man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field. And the man asked him, saying, What are you seeking?

16. And he said, I am seeking my brothers. Please tell me where they are feeding their flocks.

17. And the man said, They have departed from here, for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan.

18. Now when they saw him from a distance, even before he came near them, they conspired against him to kill him.

19. And they said to one another, Behold, this master of dreams is coming!

20. Come now therefore, let us kill him and cast him into a pit; and we will say, Some evil beast has devoured him. And we shall see what will become of his dreams!

21. But Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands, and said, Let us not smite his soul.

22. And Reuben said to them, Do not shed blood, but cast him into this pit which is in the wilderness, and do not lay a hand on him; that he might rescue him out of their hands, and bring him back to his father.

23. So it came to pass, when Joseph had come to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic reaching to the soles of his feet.

24. And they took him and cast him into a pit. And the pit was empty; there was no water in it.

25. And they sat down to eat food. And they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites, coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices, balm, and myrrh, going and bringing them down to Egypt.

26. And Judah said to his brothers, What profit is there if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?

27. Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brothers agreed.

28. Then some Midianite traders passed by; and the brothers pulled Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.

29. And Reuben returned to the pit, and behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he tore his clothes.

30. And he returned to his brothers and said, The lad is no more; and I, where shall I go?

31. And they took Josephs tunic, killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the tunic in the blood.

32. And they sent the tunic reaching to the soles of the feet, and they brought it to their father and said, We have found this. Do you recognize whether it is your sons tunic or not?

33. And he recognized it and said, It is my sons tunic. An evil beast has devoured him. Joseph has been rent and torn to pieces.

34. And Jacob tore his clothes, put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.

35. And all his sons and all his daughters arose to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted, and he said, I will go down into Sheol mourning for my son. Thus his father wept for him.

36. Now the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard.

## Genesis 38

1. It came to pass at that time that Judah departed from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite whose name was Hirah.

2. And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua, and he took her and went in to her.

3. And she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er.

4. She conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.

5. And she did so again and bore a son, and called his name Shelah. He was at Chezib when she bore him.

6. Then Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.

7. But Er, Judahs firstborn, was evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and Jehovah killed him.

8. And Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brothers wife and marry her, and raise up seed to your brother.

9. But Onan knew that the heir would not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in to his brothers wife, that he spoiled it on the ground, so as not to give seed to his brother.

10. And the thing which he did made the eye of Jehovah quiver; therefore He killed him also.

11. Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in your fathers house till my son Shelah is grown. For he thought, Lest he also die like his brothers. And Tamar went and dwelt in her fathers house.

12. Now in the process of time the daughter of Shua, Judahs wife, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.

13. And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.

14. And she took off her widows garments, covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place which was on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him as a wife.

15. When Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot, because she had veiled her face.

16. And he turned aside to her by the way, and said, Please let me come in to you; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. So she said, What will you give me, that you may come in to me?

17. And he said, I will send a young goat from the flock. And she said, Will you give me a pledge till you send it?

18. And he said, What pledge shall I give you? So she said, Your signet ring and cord, and your staff that is in your hand. And he gave them to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him.

19. So she arose and went away, and laid aside her veil and put on the garments of her widowhood.

20. And Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the womans hand, but he did not find her.

21. Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot who was openly by the wayside? And they said, There was no harlot here.

22. So he returned to Judah and said, I have not found her. Also, the men of the place said there was no harlot there.

23. And Judah said, Let her take them for herself, that we not be held in contempt; for I sent this young goat and you have not found her.

24. And it came to pass, after about three months, that Judah was told, saying, Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot; furthermore she is with child by prostitution. So Judah said, Bring her out and let her be burned!

25. When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man to whom these belong, I am with child. And she said, Please acknowledge whose these are; the signet ring and cord, and staff.

26. And Judah acknowledged them and said, She has been more righteous than I, because I did not give her to Shelah my son. And he never knew her again.

27. And it came to pass, at the time for giving birth, that behold, twins were in her womb.

28. And so it was, when she was giving birth, that the one put out his hand; and the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his hand, saying, This one came out first.

29. And it happened, as he drew back his hand, that his brother came forth; and she said, How have you broken through this breach for yourself? Therefore his name was called Perez.

30. And afterward out came his brother who had the scarlet thread on his hand. And his name was called Zerah.

## Genesis 39

1. Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. And Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian man, bought him from the hands of the Ishmaelites who had taken him down there.

2. And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.

3. And his master saw that Jehovah was with him and that Jehovah made all he did to prosper in his hand.

4. And Joseph found favor in his eyes, and served him. And he appointed him over his house, and all that he had he entrusted to his hand.

5. And it came to pass, from the time that he had appointed him over his house and all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptians house for Josephs sake; and the blessing of Jehovah was upon all that he had in the house and in the field.

6. Thus he left all that he had in Josephs hand, and he did not know what he had except for the bread which he ate. Now Joseph was handsome and good looking.

7. And it came to pass after these things that his masters wife cast her eyes upon Joseph, and she said, Lie with me.

8. But he refused and said to his masters wife, Behold, my master does not know what is with me in the house, and he has entrusted all that he has into my hand.

9. There is no one greater in this house than I, nor has he kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great evil, and sin against God?

10. And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day after day, that he did not give heed to her, to lie with her or to be with her.

11. And it happened about this time, when Joseph went into the house to do his work, and none of the men of the house were inside,

12. that she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me. But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and went outside.

13. And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside,

14. that she summoned the men of her house and spoke to them, saying, Behold, he has brought in to us a Hebrew man to make sport of us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice.

15. And it happened, when he heard that I lifted my voice and cried out, that he left his garment with me, and fled and went outside.

16. So she kept his garment with her until his master came into the house.

17. And she spoke to him with words like these, saying, The Hebrew servant whom you brought to us came in to me to make sport of me;

18. and it happened, as I lifted my voice and cried out, that he left his garment with me and fled outside.

19. And it came to pass, when his master heard the words which his wife spoke to him, saying, Your servant did to me after this manner, that his anger burned.

20. And Josephs master took him and put him into the prison house, the place where the kings prisoners were confined. And he was there in the prison house.

21. But Jehovah was with Joseph and extended mercy to him, and He gave him favor in the eyes of the warden of the prison house.

22. And the warden of the prison house entrusted into Josephs hand all the prisoners who were in the prison house; whatever they did there, it was his doing.

23. The warden of the prison house did not oversee anything that was under his hand, because Jehovah was with him; and whatever he did, Jehovah made it prosper.

## Genesis 40

1. And it came to pass after these things that the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt committed offense against their lord, the king of Egypt.

2. And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.

3. And he put them into custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison house, the place where Joseph was confined.

4. And the captain of the guard assigned Joseph to them, and he served them; so they were in custody for a time.

5. And the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, had a dream, both of them, each mans dream in one night and each mans dream with its own interpretation.

6. And Joseph came in to them in the morning and looked at them, and behold they appeared to be troubled.

7. So he asked Pharaohs officers who were with him in the custody of his lords house, saying, Why are your faces sad today?

8. And they said to him, We each have had a dream, and there is no interpreter. So Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell them to me, please.

9. And the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, Behold, in my dream a vine was before me,

10. and in the vine were three branches; it was as though it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes.

11. And Pharaohs cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaohs cup, and put the cup into Pharaohs hand.

12. And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation: The three branches are three days.

13. Yet within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your place, and you shall put Pharaohs cup into his hand according to the former custom, when you were his cupbearer.

14. But remember me when it is well with you, and please show kindness to me; make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.

15. For truly I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews; and also I have done nothing here that they should have put me into the dungeon.

16. When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also in my dream saw three baskets of white bread on my head.

17. And in the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head.

18. And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation: The three baskets are three days.

19. Yet within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head from you and hang you on a tree; and the birds shall eat your flesh from off you.

20. And it came to pass on the third day, which was Pharaohs birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and of the chief baker among his servants.

21. And he restored the chief cupbearer to his cupbearing again, and he put the cup into Pharaohs hand.

22. But he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.

23. Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.

## Genesis 41

1. Then it came to pass, at the end of two years of days, that Pharaoh was dreaming: And behold, he was standing by the river.

2. And behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, fine looking and fat of flesh; and they fed in the marshes.

3. And behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, bad looking and thin of flesh, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the river.

4. And the bad looking and thin-fleshed cows ate up the seven fine looking and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.

5. And he went to sleep and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, plump and good.

6. And behold, seven thin heads, scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them.

7. And the seven thin heads devoured the seven plump and full heads. And Pharaoh awoke, and lo, it was a dream.

8. And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and summoned all the astrologers of Egypt and all its wise men. And Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them for Pharaoh.

9. Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying: I remember my offenses this day.

10. When Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me into custody in the house of the captain of the guard, both me and the chief baker,

11. we each dreamed a dream in one night, he and I. Each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his dream.

12. And there was a Hebrew lad with us there, a servant of the captain of the guard. And we told him, and he interpreted our dreams for us; to each man he interpreted according to his dream.

13. And it came to pass, just as he interpreted for us, so it happened. He restored me to my office, and he hanged him.

14. Then Pharaoh sent and summoned Joseph, and they rushed him out of the dungeon; and he shaved, changed his clothing, and came in to Pharaoh.

15. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that you can understand a dream, to interpret it.

16. And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is someone besides me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

17. And Pharaoh said to Joseph: Behold, in my dream I stood on the bank of the river.

18. And behold, seven cows came up out of the river, fat of flesh and fine looking; and they fed in the marshes.

19. And behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very bad looking and thin of flesh, such badness as I have never seen in all the land of Egypt.

20. And the thin and bad cows ate up the first seven fat cows.

21. And when they had entered their stomachs, it would not have been known that they had entered their stomachs, for they looked just as bad as at the beginning. So I awoke.

22. Also I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good.

23. And behold, seven heads, withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them.

24. And the thin heads devoured the seven good heads. And I told this to the astrologers, but no one could explain it to me.

25. And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dreams of Pharaoh are one; God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do:

26. The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads are seven years; the dreams are one.

27. And the seven thin and bad cows which came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty heads scorched by the east wind are seven years of famine.

28. This is the word which I have spoken to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do.

29. Behold, seven years of great plenty are coming throughout all the land of Egypt;

30. and after them seven years of famine will arise, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine will deplete the land.

31. And the plenty will not be perceived in the land because of the famine following after, for it will be very severe.

32. And the dream was repeated unto Pharaoh twice because the thing is determined by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.

33. Now therefore, let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.

34. Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint deputies over the land, to collect one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven years of plenty.

35. And let them gather all the food of those good years that are coming, and store up grain for food in the cities under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them guard it.

36. And that food shall be as a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of Egypt, that the land may not perish during the famine.

37. And the word was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants.

38. And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?

39. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Inasmuch as God has made all this known to you, there is no one as discerning and wise as you.

40. You shall be over my house, and all my people shall be ruled according to your word; only in regard to the throne will I be greater than you.

41. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.

42. And Pharaoh took his signet ring off his hand and put it on Josephs hand; and he clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck.

43. And he made him ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried out before him, Bow the knee! So he set him over all the land of Egypt.

44. And Pharaoh also said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without you no man may lift his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.

45. And Pharaoh called Josephs name Zaphnath-Paaneah. And he gave him as a wife Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On. So Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.

46. Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.

47. And in the seven years of plenty the land brought forth by handfuls.

48. And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities; he laid up in every city the food of the fields which surrounded them.

49. And Joseph gathered very much grain, as the sand of the sea, until he stopped counting, for it was without number.

50. And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On, bore to him.

51. And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God has made me forget all my toil and all my fathers house.

52. And the name of the second he called Ephraim: For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

53. And the seven years of plenty which were in the land of Egypt ended,

54. and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. And the famine was in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.

55. And when all the land of Egypt was hungry, the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread. And Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; whatever he says to you, do.

56. And the famine was over all the face of the earth, and Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians. And the famine became severe in the land of Egypt.

57. And all earth came to Joseph in Egypt to buy, because the famine was severe in all the earth.

## Genesis 42

1. Now when Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, Why are you looking at each other?

2. And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down to that place and buy for us from there, that we may live and not die.

3. And Josephs ten brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt.

4. But Jacob did not send Josephs brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he thought, Lest he encounter some harm.

5. And the sons of Israel went to buy grain among those who journeyed, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

6. And Joseph was lord over the land; and it was he who sold to all the people of the land. And Josephs brothers came and bowed down before him, their faces to the earth.

7. And Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he acted as a stranger to them and spoke harshly to them, and he said to them, Where have you come from? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.

8. And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.

9. And Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed about them, and said to them, You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land!

10. And they said to him, No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food.

11. We are all sons of one man; we are honest; your servants are not spies.

12. And he said to them, No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land.

13. And they said, Your servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and lo, the youngest is with our father today, and one is not.

14. And Joseph said to them, It is as I have spoken to you, saying, You are spies!

15. In this manner you shall be tested: By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.

16. Send one of you, and let him bring your brother; and you shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proven to see whether there is any truth in you; or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies!

17. So he put them all together in prison three days.

18. And Joseph said to them the third day, Do this and live, for I fear God:

19. If you are honest, let one of your brothers be confined to your prison house; but you, go and carry grain for the famine of your houses.

20. And bring your youngest brother to me; so your words will be verified, and you shall not die. And they did so.

21. And they said to one another, We are truly guilty concerning our brother, for we saw the anguish of his soul when he pleaded with us, and we would not listen; therefore this distress has come upon us.

22. And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Do not sin against the boy; and you would not listen? Therefore behold, his blood is now required of us.

23. But they did not know that Joseph understood them, for he spoke to them through an interpreter.

24. And he turned himself away from them and wept, and returned to them again, and talked with them. And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.

25. And Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with grain, to restore every mans money to his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. Thus he did for them.

26. And they loaded their donkeys with the grain and departed from there.

27. And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey feed at the lodging, he saw his money; and behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.

28. And he said to his brothers, My money has been restored, and lo, it is in my sack! And their hearts failed them and they were afraid, saying to one another, What is this that God has done to us?

29. And they went to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan and told him all that had befallen them, saying:

30. The man who is lord of the land spoke harshly to us, and took us for spies in the land.

31. And we said to him, We are honest; we are not spies.

32. We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is with our father this day in the land of Canaan.

33. And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, By this I will know that you are honest: Leave one of your brothers here with me, take food for the famine of your houses, and go.

34. And bring your youngest brother to me; so I shall know that you are not spies, but that you are honest. I will give your brother to you, and you may trade in the land.

35. And it happened as they emptied their sacks, that behold, each mans bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.

36. And Jacob their father said to them, You have bereaved me: Joseph is not, Simeon is not, and you would take Benjamin. All these things are against me.

37. And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you; put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you.

38. But he said, My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he is left alone. If any harm should befall him along the way in which you go, then you would bring down my gray hair in sorrow to Sheol.

## Genesis 43

1. Now the famine was severe in the land.

2. And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought from Egypt, that their father said to them, Go back, buy us a little food.

3. And Judah spoke to him, saying, The man solemnly charged us, saying, You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.

4. If you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy food for you.

5. But if you will not send him, we will not go down; for the man said to us, You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.

6. And Israel said, Why did you deal so wickedly with me as to tell the man whether you had yet another brother?

7. And they said, The man sought to ask us about ourselves and our kindred, saying, Is your father still alive? Have you another brother? And we told him these words with our mouths. Could we possibly have known that he would say, Bring your brother down?

8. And Judah said to Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you and also our little ones.

9. I myself will be surety for him; from my hand you shall require him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then I shall bear the guilt forever.

10. For if we had not delayed, surely by now we would have returned this second time.

11. And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so, then do this: Take some of the best fruits of the land in your vessels and carry down a present for the man; a little balm and a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts and almonds.

12. Take double money in your hand, and take back in your hand the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks; perhaps it was an oversight.

13. Take your brother also, and arise, go back to the man.

14. And may God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved, I am bereaved!

15. So the men took this present and Benjamin, and they took double money in their hand, and arose and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.

16. And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, Take these men to my house, and slaughter an animal and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.

17. And the man did as Joseph commanded, and the man brought the men into Josephs house.

18. And the men were afraid because they were brought into Josephs house; and they said, It is because of the money, which was returned in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may roll against us and fall upon us, to take us as slaves with our donkeys.

19. And they came near to the steward of Josephs house and spoke with him at the entrance of the house,

20. and said, O sir, we indeed came down the first time to buy food;

21. but it happened, when we came to the lodging place, that we opened our sacks, and behold, each mans money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; so we have brought it back in our hand.

22. And we have brought down other money in our hands to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.

23. And he said, Peace to you, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money. And he brought Simeon out to them.

24. So the man brought the men into Josephs house and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys feed.

25. And they made the present ready for Josephs coming at noon, for they heard that they would eat bread there.

26. And when Joseph came into the house, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and prostrated before him to the earth.

27. And he asked after their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?

28. And they answered, Your servant our father is in good health; he is still alive. And they bowed down and prostrated themselves.

29. And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mothers son, and said, Is this your younger brother of whom you spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to you, my son.

30. Now his compassions yearned for his brother; so Joseph made haste and sought somewhere to weep. And he went into his chamber and wept there.

31. And he washed his face and came out; and he restrained himself, and said, Serve the food.

32. And they set him a place by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves; because the Egyptians could not eat food with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.

33. And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth; and the men were astonished at one another.

34. And he took portions to them from before him, but Benjamins portion was five hands greater than any of theirs. So they drank and were drunken with him.

## Genesis 44

1. And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the mens sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each mans money in the mouth of his sack.

2. And put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and his grain money. So he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.

3. As soon as the morning had dawned, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.

4. And when they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, Arise and pursue the men; and when you have overtaken them, say to them, Why have you repaid evil for good?

5. Is not this the one from which my lord drinks, and with which he indeed practices divination? You have done evil in so doing.

6. So he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words.

7. And they said to him, Why does my lord say these words? Far be it from us that your servants should do such a thing.

8. Behold, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lords house?

9. With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lords slaves.

10. And he said, Now also let it be according to your words; he with whom it is found shall be my slave, and you shall be innocent.

11. And each man hastened to let down his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack.

12. And he searched. He began with the oldest and finished with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamins sack.

13. Then they tore their clothes, and each man loaded his donkey and returned to the city.

14. And Judah and his brothers came to Josephs house, and he was still there; and they prostrated before him on the ground.

15. And Joseph said to them, What deed is this you have done? Did you not know that such a man as I can certainly practice divination?

16. And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how shall we justify ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants; behold, we are my lords slaves, both we and he also with whom the cup was found.

17. And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so; the man in whose hand the cup was found, he shall be my slave. And as for you, go up in peace to your father.

18. Then Judah came near to him and said: O my lord, please let your servant speak a word in the ears of my lord, and do not let your anger burn against your servant; for you are even as Pharaoh.

19. My lord asked his servants, saying, Have you a father or a brother?

20. And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, who is young; his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.

21. And you said to your servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon him.

22. And we said to my lord, The lad cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.

23. But you said to your servants, Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall see my face no more.

24. And it came to pass, when we went up to your servant my father, that we told him the words of my lord.

25. And our father said, Go back and buy us a little food.

26. And we said, We cannot go down; if our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down; for we may not see the mans face unless our youngest brother is with us.

27. And your servant my father said to us, You know that my wife bore me two sons;

28. and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn to pieces; and I have not seen him since.

29. And if you take this one also from before me, and harm befalls him, you shall bring down my gray hair with sorrow to Sheol.

30. Now therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad is not with us, since his soul is bound up in the lads soul,

31. it shall come to pass, when he sees that the lad is not with us, that he will die. So your servants will bring down the gray hair of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.

32. For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the guilt before my father for all time.

33. Now therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the lad as a slave to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brothers.

34. For how shall I go up to my father if the lad is not with me, lest perhaps I see the evil that would come upon my father?

## Genesis 45

1. Then Joseph could not restrain himself before all those who stood by him, and he cried out, Make everyone go out from me! So no one stood with him while Joseph made himself known to his brothers.

2. And he wept aloud, and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard it.

3. And Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph; is my father still alive? But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence.

4. And Joseph said to his brothers, Please come near to me. So they came near. And he said: I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.

5. But now, do not therefore be grieved or angry in your eyes because you sold me here; for God has sent me before you to preserve life.

6. For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are yet five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvesting.

7. And God sent me before you to preserve you as a remnant in the earth, and to keep you alive by a great deliverance.

8. So now it was not you who sent me here, but God; and He has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.

9. Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him, Thus says your son Joseph: God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not delay.

10. And you shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near to me, you and your children, your childrens children, your flocks and your herds, and all that you have.

11. And I will nourish you there, so that you and your house, and all that you have, not come to poverty; for there are yet five years of famine.

12. And behold, your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it is my mouth that is speaking to you.

13. And you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen; and you shall hurry and bring my father down here.

14. And he fell on the neck of his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck.

15. Moreover he kissed all his brothers and wept over them, and after that his brothers talked with him.

16. And the report of it was heard in Pharaohs house, saying, Josephs brothers have come. And it was well pleasing in the eyes of Pharaoh and his servants.

17. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to your brothers, Do this: Load your animals and depart; go to the land of Canaan.

18. And bring your father and your households and come to me; I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.

19. Now you are commanded; do this: Take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and your wives; bring your father and come.

20. Also do not be concerned about your goods, for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.

21. And the sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the mouth of Pharaoh, and he gave them provisions for the journey.

22. He gave to all of them, to each man, changes of garments; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of garments.

23. And he sent to his father these things: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and food for his father for the journey.

24. So he sent his brothers away, and they departed; and he said to them, See that you do not become perturbed along the way.

25. And they went up out of Egypt, and came to the land of Canaan to Jacob their father.

26. And they told him, saying, Joseph is still alive, and he is ruling over all the land of Egypt. And his heart became numb, for he did not believe them.

27. But when they told him all the words which Joseph had spoken to them, and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived.

28. And Israel said, It is enough! Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.

## Genesis 46

1. So Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba. And he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.

2. And God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and called out, Jacob! Jacob! And he said, Here am I.

3. And He said, I am the Mighty God, the God of your fathers. Do not fear to go down to Egypt, for I will make of you a great nation there.

4. I will go down with you into Egypt, and I will arise to bring you back. And Joseph shall put his hand on your eyes.

5. And Jacob arose from Beer-sheba; and the sons of Israel carried their father Jacob, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.

6. So they took their livestock and their possessions which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob and all his seed with him.

7. His sons and his sons sons, his daughters and his sons daughters, and all his seed he brought with him into Egypt.

8. And these were the names of the sons of Israel who went into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben was Jacobs firstborn.

9. The sons of Reuben were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.

10. The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman.

11. The sons of Levi were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

12. The sons of Judah were Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan). The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.

13. The sons of Issachar were Tola, Puvah, Job, and Shimron.

14. The sons of Zebulun were Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.

15. These were the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan, with his daughter Dinah. All the souls, his sons and his daughters: thirty-three.

16. The sons of Gad were Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.

17. The sons of Asher were Jimnah, Ishuah, Isui, Beriah, and Serah, their sister. And the sons of Beriah were Heber and Malchiel.

18. These were the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and these she bore to Jacob: sixteen souls.

19. The sons of Rachel, Jacobs wife, were Joseph and Benjamin.

20. And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On, bore to him.

21. The sons of Benjamin were Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.

22. These were the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: fourteen souls in all.

23. The son of Dan was Hushim.

24. The sons of Naphtali were Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.

25. These were the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and she bore these to Jacob: seven souls in all.

26. All the souls who went with Jacob to Egypt, who came forth from his loins, besides Jacobs sons wives, were sixty-six souls in all.

27. And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt were two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob who went into Egypt were seventy.

28. And he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to give directions before him to Goshen. And they came into the land of Goshen.

29. And Joseph prepared his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father Israel; and he presented himself to him, and fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while.

30. And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen your face, because you are still alive.

31. And Joseph said to his brothers and to his fathers house, I will go up and report to Pharaoh, and say to him, My brothers and those of my fathers house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.

32. And the men tend cattle, for they are men of livestock; and they have brought their flocks, their herds, and all that they have.

33. So it shall be, when Pharaoh summons you and says, What is your occupation?

34. that you shall say, Your servants have been men of livestock from our youth even until now, both we and also our fathers; that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.

## Genesis 47

1. And Joseph came and reported to Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brothers, their flocks and their herds and all that they possess, have come from the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen.

2. And he took five men from among his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh.

3. And Pharaoh said to his brothers, What is your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Your servants are shepherds, both we and also our fathers.

4. And they said to Pharaoh, We have come to sojourn in the land, because your servants have no pasture for their flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.

5. And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Your father and your brothers have come to you.

6. The land of Egypt is before you. Have your father and brothers dwell in the best of the land; let them dwell in the land of Goshen. And if you know any men with ability among them, make them chief herdsmen over my livestock.

7. And Joseph brought in his father Jacob and presented him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

8. And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How many are the days of the years of your life?

9. And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.

10. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.

11. And Joseph situated his father and his brothers, and gave them property in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.

12. And Joseph sustained his father, his brothers, and all his fathers house with food, according to the mouths of the children.

13. And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine.

14. And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaohs house.

15. And when the money failed in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, Give us bread, for why should we die in your presence? For the money has failed.

16. And Joseph said, Give your livestock, and I will give you bread for your livestock, if the money has failed.

17. So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, the flocks, the cattle of the herds, and for the donkeys. Thus he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock that year.

18. When that year had ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, We will not hide from my lord that our money is gone; my lord also has our cattle and livestock. Nothing remains before my lord but our bodies and our lands.

19. Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants of Pharaoh; give us seed, that we may live and not die, that the land not be desolate.

20. And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for every man of the Egyptians sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. So the land became Pharaohs.

21. And as for the people, he moved them into the cities, from one end of the borders of Egypt to the other end.

22. Only the land of the priests he did not buy; for the priests had portions prescribed to them by Pharaoh, and they ate their portions which Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their lands.

23. Then Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you and your land this day for Pharaoh. Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.

24. And it shall come to pass in the harvest that you shall give one-fifth to Pharaoh; and four-fifths shall be your own, as seed for the field and for your food, for those of your houses and as food for your little ones.

25. And they said, You have saved our lives; let us find favor in the eyes of my lord, and we will be Pharaohs servants.

26. And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have one-fifth, except for the land of the priests only, which did not become Pharaohs.

27. And Israel remained in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they settled on property they owned there and grew and multiplied exceedingly.

28. And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacobs life was one hundred and forty-seven years.

29. And the time drew near for Israel to die. And he called his son Joseph and said to him, Now if I have found favor in your eyes, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please do not bury me in Egypt,

30. but let me lie with my fathers. You shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place. And he said, I will do as you have said.

31. And he said, Swear to me. And he swore to him. And Israel prostrated himself on the head of the bed.

## Genesis 48

1. Now it came to pass after these things that Joseph was told, Behold, your father is sick; and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.

2. And Jacob was told, they said, Behold, your son Joseph is coming to you. And Israel strengthened himself and sat up on the bed.

3. And Jacob said to Joseph: God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me,

4. and said to me, Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a multitude of people, and give this land to your seed after you as an enduring possession.

5. And now your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.

6. Your offspring whom you beget after them shall be yours; they shall be called according to the name of their brothers in their inheritance.

7. But as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was but a little distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (which is Bethlehem).

8. And Israel saw Josephs sons, and said, Who are these?

9. And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me in this place. And he said, Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.

10. Now the eyes of Israel had become dull with age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near him, and he kissed them and embraced them.

11. And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see your face; but lo, God has also shown me your seed.

12. And Joseph brought them from beside his knees, and he prostrated with his face to the earth.

13. And Joseph took them both, Ephraim with his right hand toward Israels left hand, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israels right hand, and brought them to him.

14. And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on Ephraims head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manassehs head, crossing his hands; for Manasseh was the firstborn.

15. And he blessed Joseph, and said: God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has fed me since I was born to this day,

16. the Angel who redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; let my name be called upon them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.

17. Now when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it caused his eye to quiver; so he took hold of his fathers hand to remove it from Ephraims head onto Manassehs head.

18. And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.

19. But his father refused and said, I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.

20. And he blessed them that day, saying, In you Israel shall bless, saying, May God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh! And thus he set Ephraim before Manasseh.

21. Then Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you and bring you back to the land of your fathers.

22. Moreover I have extended your shoulder above your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and my bow.

## Genesis 49

1. And Jacob summoned his sons and said, Gather around, that I may tell you what shall befall you in the last days:

2. Gather around and hear, you sons of Jacob, and listen to Israel your father.

3. Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power.

4. Like bubbling water, you shall not excel, because you went up to your fathers bed; then you defiled it; he went up to my couch.

5. Simeon and Levi are brothers; implements of violence are their weapons.

6. Let not my soul enter their council; let not my honor be united to their assembly; for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they have hamstrung an ox.

7. Cursed is their anger, for it is fierce; and their wrath, for it is cruel! I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel.

8. Judah, you are he whom your brothers shall praise; your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; your fathers children shall bow down before you.

9. Judah is a lions whelp; from the prey, my son, you have gone up. He bows down, he crouches like a lion; and as a lioness, who shall rouse him?

10. The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a Lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh comes; and to Him shall be the cleansing of the peoples.

11. Binding His donkey to the vine, and His donkeys colt to the choice vine, He has washed His garments in wine, and His clothes in the blood of grapes;

12. His eyes flashing with wine, and His teeth white with milk.

13. Zebulun shall dwell by the seashore; he shall become a haven for ships, bordering Sidon.

14. Issachar is a strong donkey, lying down between two burdens.

15. He saw that the resting place was good, and that the land was pleasant. He bowed his shoulder to bear a burden, and became a servant to forced labor.

16. Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel.

17. Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder by the path, that bites the horses heels so that its rider shall fall backward.

18. I have waited for your salvation, O Jehovah.

19. Gad, a troop shall attack him, but he shall attack their heel.

20. Bread from Asher shall be rich, and he shall produce kings delicacies.

21. Naphtali is a deer let loose; he utters beautiful words.

22. Joseph is a fruitful bough, a fruitful bough by a spring; his branches have run over the wall.

23. The archers have bitterly grieved him, shot at him and carried animosity against him.

24. But his bow remained steadfast, and the arms of his hands were made nimble by the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob; from the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel,

25. by the Mighty God of your father who will help you, and by the Almighty who will bless you with blessings of the heavens above, blessings of the deep that lies beneath, blessings of the breasts and of the womb.

26. The blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of my ancestors, to the bounds of the enduring hills. They shall be upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the head of him who was separate from his brothers.

27. Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall distribute the spoils.

28. All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father spoke to them. And he blessed them; he blessed each one according to his own blessing.

29. And he charged them and said to them: I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,

30. in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite as a possession for a burial place.

31. There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife, there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah.

32. The field and the cave that is there were purchased from the sons of Heth.

33. And when Jacob had finished commanding his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed and expired, and was gathered to his people.

## Genesis 50

1. And Joseph fell on his fathers face, and wept over him, and kissed him.

2. And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel.

3. Forty days were fulfilled for him, for such are the days fulfilled for those who are embalmed; and the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.

4. And when the days of his weeping were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,

5. My father made me swear, saying, Behold, I am dying; in my grave which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you shall bury me. Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and return.

6. And Pharaoh said, Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear.

7. And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,

8. as well as all the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his fathers house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen.

9. And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen, and it was a very great company.

10. And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is on the other side of Jordan, and they mourned there with great and heavy lamentation. He observed seven days of mourning for his father.

11. And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, This is a great mourning of the Egyptians. Therefore its name was called Abel Mizraim, which is on the other side of Jordan.

12. So his sons did for him just as he had commanded them.

13. For his sons carried him to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as property for a burial place.

14. And after he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers and all who went up with him to bury his father.

15. And when Josephs brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, Perhaps Joseph will hold a grudge against us, and return and repay us for all the evil which we did unto him.

16. So they sent a messenger to Joseph, saying, Before your father died he commanded, saying,

17. Thus you shall say to Joseph: I beg you, please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin; for they did evil to you. Now, please, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.

18. And his brothers also went and prostrated before his face, and they said, Behold, we are your slaves.

19. And Joseph said to them, Do not be afraid, for am I in the place of God?

20. As for you, you had devised evil against me; but God had planned it for good, in order to bring it about as it is this day, to save many people alive.

21. Now therefore, do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your little ones. And he comforted them and spoke to their hearts.

22. And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his fathers house. And Joseph lived one hundred and ten years.

23. And Joseph saw Ephraims children to the third generation. Also the children of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born upon Josephs knees.

24. And Joseph said to his brethren, I am dying; but God will attend to visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land of which He swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

25. And Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, God will attend to visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.

26. So Joseph died, being one hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
