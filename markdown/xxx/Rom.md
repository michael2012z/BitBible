## Romans 1

1. Paul, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, called an apostle, separated to the gospel of God

2. which He promised before through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures,

3. concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh,

4. and defined as the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead.

5. Through Him we have received grace and apostleship unto obedience of faith among all nations for His name,

6. among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ;

7. to all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

8. First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout all the world.

9. For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers,

10. making request if, by any means now at last, I may prosper by the will of God to come to you.

11. For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, so that you may be strengthened;

12. that is, that I may be encouraged together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.

13. Now I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, that I often planned to come to you (but was prevented until now), that I might have some fruit among you also, just as among the other Gentiles.

14. I am a debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise.

15. So, as much as is in me, I am ready to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome also.

16. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who is believing, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

17. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; even as it is written, The just shall live by faith.

18. For the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,

19. because what may be known of God is clearly recognized by them, for God has revealed it to them.

20. For ever since the creation of the world the unseen things of Him are clearly perceived, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse,

21. because, although they know God, they do not glorify Him as God, nor are thankful, but become vain in their reasonings, and their stupid hearts are darkened.

22. Professing to be wise, they become foolish,

23. and change the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man, and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things.

24. Therefore God also gives them up to uncleanness, in the lusts of their hearts, to dishonor their bodies among themselves,

25. who change the truth of God into the lie, and fear and serve the created things more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.

26. For this reason God gives them up to vile passions. For even their women change the natural use for what is contrary to nature.

27. Likewise also the men, abandoning the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another, men with men performing what is shameful, and receiving the retribution within themselves, the penalty which is fitting for their error.

28. And even as they do not like to have God in their full true knowledge, God gives them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;

29. being filled with every unrighteousness, sexual perversion, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, depravity; whisperers,

30. defamers, haters of God, insolent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,

31. without understanding, untrustworthy, without natural affection, unforgiving, unmerciful;

32. who, knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are deserving of death, not only do them, but also approve of those who practice them.

## Romans 2

1. Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judges, for in whatever you judge another you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things.

2. But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those who practice such things.

3. And do you think this, O man, you who judges those practicing such things, and doing the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?

4. Or do you despise the riches of His kindness, forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?

5. But according to your hardness and impenitent heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,

6. who will render to each one according to his works:

7. eternal life to those who steadfastly doing good, seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility;

8. but to those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness; anger and wrath,

9. trouble and anguish, on every soul of man who produces evil, of the Jew first and also of the Greek;

10. but glory, honor, and peace to everyone who works what is good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

11. For there is no partiality with God.

12. For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law, and as many as have sinned within the Law will be judged through the Law

13. (for not the hearers of the Law are just before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified;

14. for when Gentiles, who do not have the Law, by nature do the things in the Law, these, although not having the Law, are a law to themselves,

15. who show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts meanwhile accusing or else excusing themselves)

16. in the day when God will judge the secrets of men through Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.

17. Behold, you are called a Jew, and rest on the Law, and make your boast in God,

18. and know His will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the Law,

19. and are confident that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,

20. an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having the form of knowledge and truth in the Law.

21. You, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that a man should not steal, do you steal?

22. You who say, Do not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?

23. You who make your boast in the Law, do you dishonor God through transgressing the Law?

24. For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.

25. For circumcision is indeed profitable if you keep the Law; but if you are a transgressor of the Law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.

26. Therefore, if an uncircumcised man keeps the righteousness of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be counted as circumcision?

27. And will not the naturally uncircumcised, if he fulfills the Law, judge you who, though having the writings and circumcision, are a transgressor of the Law?

28. For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh;

29. but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, in the Spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not from men but from God.

## Romans 3

1. What, then, is the superiority of the Jew, or what is the profit of circumcision?

2. Much in every way: chiefly because they were entrusted with the Words of God.

3. For what if some did not believe? Will their unbelief nullify the faithfulness of God?

4. Let it not be! Indeed, let God be true but every man a liar. As it is written: That You may be found just in Your words, and may win the case when You are judged.

5. But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust who lays on wrath? (I speak as a man.)

6. Let it not be! Otherwise, how will God judge the world?

7. For if in my lie, the truth of God has abounded to His glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?

8. And why not say (as we are slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil that good may come? Their condemnation is just.

9. What then? Do we surpass them? Not at all. For we have previously charged both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin.

10. As it is written: There is none righteous, no, not one;

11. there is none who understands; there is none who seeks after God.

12. They have all turned aside; they have together become unprofitable; there is none who does good, no, not one.

13. Their throat is an open tomb; with their tongues they have practiced deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips;

14. whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.

15. Their feet are swift to shed blood;

16. destruction and misery are in their ways;

17. and the way of peace they have not known.

18. There is no fear of God before their eyes.

19. Now we know that whatever the Law says, it says to those who are under the Law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.

20. Therefore by the deeds of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for through the Law is the full true knowledge of sin.

21. But now the righteousness of God apart from the Law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,

22. even the righteousness of God, through the faith of Jesus Christ, to all and upon all who believe. For there is no difference;

23. for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,

24. being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,

25. whom God set forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood, to give evidence of His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed,

26. to prove at the present time His righteousness, that He might be just and the justifier of the one who is of the faith of Jesus.

27. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but through the law of faith.

28. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the Law.

29. Or is He the God of the Jews only? Is He not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also,

30. since there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.

31. Do we then annul the Law through faith? Let it not be! No rather, we establish the Law.

## Romans 4

1. What then shall we say that Abraham our father has found according to the flesh?

2. For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.

3. For what does the Scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.

4. Now to him who works, the wages are not counted according to grace but according to debt.

5. But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted unto righteousness,

6. just as David also describes the blessedness of the man to whom God accounts righteousness apart from works:

7. Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;

8. blessed is the man to whom the Lord shall not account sin.

9. Does this blessedness then come upon the circumcised only, or upon the uncircumcised also? For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness.

10. How then was it accounted? While he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.

11. And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while still uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all those believing through uncircumcision, that righteousness might be accounted to them also;

12. and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham while still uncircumcised.

13. For the promise that he would be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith.

14. For if those who are of the Law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise has been annulled,

15. because the Law brings about wrath; for where there is no law, neither is there transgression.

16. Therefore it is of faith that it might be according to grace, so that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not only to those who are of the Law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all

17. (as it is written, I have made you a father of many nations) in the presence of Him whom he believed; God, who makes the dead alive and calls those things which do not exist as though they did;

18. who, against hope, believed in hope, so that he might become the father of many nations, according to what was spoken, So shall your seed be.

19. And not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body, already dead (since he was about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarahs womb;

20. he did not hesitate at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God,

21. and being fully assured that what He had promised He is also able to perform.

22. And therefore it was accounted to him for righteousness.

23. Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was accounted to him,

24. but also for us, to whom it shall be accounted, believing in Him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead,

25. who was delivered up because of our trespasses, and was raised for our justification.

## Romans 5

1. Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,

2. through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice on the hope of the glory of God.

3. And not only that, but we also exult in afflictions, knowing that affliction produces perseverance;

4. and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope.

5. And hope does not make ashamed, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.

6. For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.

7. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man some would even be bold enough to die.

8. But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

9. Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.

10. For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.

11. And not only that, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.

12. Therefore, just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to every person, because everyone sinned.

13. For until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not accounted when there is no law.

14. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned according to the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come.

15. But the free gift is not like the offense. For if by the one mans offense many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many.

16. And the gift is not like it was through the one who sinned. For the judgment from one offense was unto condemnation, but the free gift from many offenses is unto justification.

17. For if by the one mans offense death reigned through the one, much more those who are receiving abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.

18. Therefore, as through one mans offense judgment was to every person unto condemnation, even so through one Mans righteous act the free gift is to every person unto justification of life.

19. For as through one mans disobedience many were declared sinners, so also through one Mans obedience many will be declared righteous.

20. Moreover the Law entered that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more,

21. so that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

## Romans 6

1. What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?

2. Let it not be! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?

3. Or do you not know that as many of us as were immersed into Christ Jesus were immersed into His death?

4. Therefore we were buried with Him through immersion into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.

5. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in resurrection,

6. knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be nullified, that we should no longer serve sin.

7. For he who has died has been justified from sin.

8. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,

9. knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him.

10. For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives unto God.

11. Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

12. Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.

13. And do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.

14. For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under Law but under grace.

15. What then? Shall we sin because we are not under Law but under grace? Let it not be!

16. Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, you are that ones slaves whom you obey, whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?

17. But God be thanked that though you were slaves of sin, yet you obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you.

18. And having been set free from sin, you became slaves to righteousness.

19. I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness, and to iniquity unto iniquity, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification.

20. For when you were slaves to sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.

21. What fruit did you have then in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.

22. But now having been set free from sin, and having become slaves to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end, eternal life.

23. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

## Romans 7

1. Or do you not know, brethren (for I speak to those who know the Law), that the Law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?

2. For the woman who has a husband is bound by the Law to her husband as long as he lives. But if the husband dies, she is released from the law of her husband.

3. So then if, while her husband lives, she becomes another mans, she will be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law, so that she is no adulteress, though she becomes another mans.

4. Therefore, my brethren, you also have become dead to the Law through the body of Christ, that you may become Anothers; to Him who was raised from the dead, that we should bear fruit unto God.

5. For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sin which were through the Law were at work in our members to bear fruit unto death.

6. But now we have been loosed from the Law, having died to that in which we were held, so that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter.

7. What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? Let it not be! On the contrary, I would not have understood sin except through the Law. For I would not have known lust unless the Law had said, You shall not covet.

8. But sin, taking occasion through the commandment, produced in me every lust. For apart from the Law sin is dead.

9. I was alive once apart from the Law, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died.

10. And the commandment, which was unto life, I found to be unto death.

11. For sin, taking occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.

12. Therefore the Law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.

13. Has then that which is good become death to me? Let it not be! But sin, that it might appear to be sin, was producing death in me through what is good, so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful.

14. For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin.

15. For what I am doing, I do not understand. For what I do not wish to do, that I do; moreover, what I hate, that I do.

16. If, then, I do what I do not wish to do, I agree with the Law that it is good.

17. But now, it is no longer I doing it, but sin that dwells in me.

18. For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for to desire is present with me, but how to perform what is good I do not find.

19. For the good that I wish to do, I do not do; but the evil I do not wish to do, that I practice.

20. Now if I do what I do not wish to do, it is no longer I doing it, but sin that dwells in me.

21. I find then a law, that evil is present with me, the one desiring to do good.

22. For I delight in the Law of God according to the inward man.

23. But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.

24. O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?

25. I thank God; through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with the mind I myself serve the Law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.

## Romans 8

1. There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.

2. For the Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death.

3. For what the Law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh; and on account of sin, He condemned sin in the flesh,

4. that the righteous requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.

5. For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.

6. For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.

7. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the Law of God, nor indeed can be.

8. So then, those who are in the flesh are not able to please God.

9. But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.

10. And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.

11. But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also make your mortal bodies alive through His Spirit who dwells in you.

12. Therefore, brethren, we are debtors; not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.

13. For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.

14. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.

15. For you did not receive a spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, Abba, Father.

16. The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,

17. and if children, then heirs; heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together.

18. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed unto us.

19. For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God.

20. For the creation was subjected to vanity, not willingly, but through Him who subjected it in hope;

21. because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.

22. For we know that the whole creation groans and travails together until now.

23. Not only that, but we also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body.

24. For we were saved by hope, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees?

25. But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with perseverance.

26. Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.

27. Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to God.

28. And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.

29. For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren.

30. Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.

31. What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?

32. He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?

33. Who shall bring a charge against Gods elect? It is God who justifies.

34. Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, but rather is also raised, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.

35. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall affliction, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?

36. As it is written: For Your sake we are killed all day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

37. Yet in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loves us.

38. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers nor powers, nor things present nor things to come,

39. nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

## Romans 9

1. I tell the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience also bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit,

2. that I have great sorrow and continual grief in my heart.

3. For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ on behalf of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh,

4. who are Israelites, to whom pertain the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the Law, the service of God, and the promises;

5. of whom are the fathers and from whom, according to the flesh, is Christ, being God over all, blessed forever. Amen.

6. Moreover, it is not as though the Word of God has fallen away. For not all those of Israel are Israel,

7. nor are they all children because they are the seed of Abraham; but, In Isaac your Seed shall be called.

8. That is, those who are the children of flesh, these are not the children of God; but the children of the promise are accounted as seed.

9. For this is the Word of promise: At this time I will come and Sarah shall have a son.

10. And not only this, but when Rebecca also had conceived by one man, even by our father Isaac

11. (for the children not yet being born, nor having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works but of Him who calls),

12. it was said to her, The elder shall serve the younger.

13. As it is written, Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated.

14. What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? Let it not be!

15. For He says to Moses, I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion.

16. So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy.

17. For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show My power in you, and that My name might be declared in all the earth.

18. Therefore He has mercy on whom He wills, and whom He wills He hardens.

19. You will say to me then, Why does He yet find fault? For who has resisted His will?

20. No, rather, O man, who are you to reply against God? Will the thing formed say to him who formed it, Why have you made me like this?

21. Does not the potter have authority over the clay, from the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor?

22. What if God, determining to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath rendered fit unto destruction,

23. and that He might make known the riches of His glory on vessels of mercy, which He had prepared beforehand unto glory,

24. whom He also called, not only of us Jews, but also of the Gentiles?

25. As He says also in Hosea: I will call them My people, who were not My people, and her beloved, who was not beloved.

26. And it shall come to pass in the place where it was said to them, You are not My people, There they shall be called, Sons of the living God.

27. Isaiah also cries out concerning Israel: Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant will be saved.

28. For He is fulfilling the Word and executing it quickly in righteousness, because the Lord will quickly execute the Word upon the earth.

29. And as Isaiah said before: Unless the Lord of Hosts had left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom, and we would have been made like Gomorrah.

30. What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have taken hold of righteousness, even the righteousness of faith;

31. but Israel, pursuing the Law of righteousness, has not arrived at the Law of righteousness.

32. Why? Because it was not by faith, but as out of works of the Law. For they stumbled at the stumbling stone.

33. As it is written: Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and rock of offense, and everyone believing on Him will not be put to shame.

## Romans 10

1. Brethren, my hearts desire and prayer to God for Israel is for them to be saved.

2. For I bear witness of them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to full true knowledge.

3. For they, being ignorant of Gods righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to the righteousness of God.

4. For Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to everyone who believes.

5. For Moses writes about the righteousness which is of the Law, The man who does those things shall live by them.

6. But the righteousness of faith speaks in this manner, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into Heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down)

7. or, Who will descend into the abyss? (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).

8. But what does it say? The Word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart (that is, the Word of Faith which we preach):

9. that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.

10. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

11. For the Scripture says, Everyone believing on Him will not be put to shame.

12. For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich toward all who call upon Him.

13. For everyone, whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.

14. How then shall they call on Him into whom they do not believe? And how shall they believe Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without preaching?

15. And how shall they preach if they are not sent? As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those preaching the gospel of peace, bringing glad tidings of good things.

16. But they have not all obeyed the gospel, for Isaiah says, Lord, who believes our report?

17. So then faith is of hearing, and hearing through the Word of God.

18. But I say, have they not heard? Yes indeed: Their sound has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.

19. But I say, did Israel not know? First Moses says: I will provoke you to jealousy by those who are not a nation, I will move you to anger by a foolish nation.

20. But Isaiah is very bold and says: I was found by those who did not seek Me; I was made manifest to those not inquiring after Me.

21. But to Israel he says: All day long I have stretched out My hands to a disobedient and contradicting people.

## Romans 11

1. I say then, has God cast away His people? Let it not be! For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.

2. God has not cast away His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel, saying,

3. Lord, they have killed Your prophets and torn down Your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.

4. But what does the Divine response say to him? I have reserved to Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.

5. Even so then, at this present time there is a remnant according to the election of grace.

6. And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace no longer becomes grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.

7. What then? Israel has not obtained what it seeks; but the elect have obtained it, and the rest were hardened.

8. Just as it is written: God has given them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear, to this very day.

9. And David says: Let their table become a snare and a trap, and a stumbling block and a recompense to them.

10. Let their eyes be darkened, so that they do not see, and bow down their back always.

11. I say then, have they stumbled that they should come to an end? Let it not be! But through their trespass, to provoke them to jealousy, salvation has come to the Gentiles.

12. Now if their trespass is riches for the world; and their diminishing, riches for the Gentiles; how much more their fullness.

13. For I speak to you Gentiles; inasmuch as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry,

14. if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh and save some of them.

15. For if their being cast away is the reconciling of the world, what will their reception be but life from the dead?

16. For if the firstfruit is holy, the lump is also holy; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.

17. And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them became a partaker of the root and fatness of the olive tree,

18. do not boast against the branches. But if you do boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you.

19. You will say then, The branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.

20. Well, because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Do not be highminded, but fear.

21. For if God did not spare the natural branches, He may not spare you either.

22. Therefore consider the goodness and severity of God: On those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in His goodness. Otherwise you also will be cut off.

23. And they also, if they do not continue in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.

24. For if you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, who are natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree.

25. For I do not desire, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, that you not be wise within yourselves, that hardness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles comes in.

26. And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: The Deliverer will come out of Zion, and He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob;

27. for this is My covenant with them, when I take away their sins.

28. Indeed, concerning the gospel they are enemies because of you, but concerning the election they are beloved because of the fathers.

29. For the gifts and the calling of God are without regret.

30. For as you were once disobedient to God, yet have now obtained mercy through their disobedience,

31. even so these also have now been disobedient, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.

32. For God has enclosed everyone in disobedience, that He might have mercy on each one.

33. Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and His ways past finding out!

34. For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has become His counselor?

35. Or who has first given to Him and it shall be repaid to him?

36. For of Him and through Him and to Him are all things, to whom be glory forever. Amen.

## Romans 12

1. I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.

2. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

3. For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to understand with a sound mind, as God has dealt to each one a measure of faith.

4. For as we have many members in one body, but all the members do not have the same function,

5. so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another.

6. But having different gifts according to the grace that is given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, according to the proportion of faith;

7. or ministry, in ministering; he who teaches, in teaching;

8. he who exhorts, in exhortation; he who gives, with simplicity; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.

9. Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil. Cleave to what is good.

10. Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, leading the way before one another in honor;

11. not slothful in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord;

12. rejoicing in hope, patient in affliction, continuing steadfastly in prayer;

13. distributing to the needs of the saints, given to hospitality.

14. Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.

15. Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.

16. Be of the same mind toward one another. Do not set your mind on high things, but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own opinion.

17. Repay no one evil for evil. Have regard for good things in the sight of all men.

18. If it is possible, as for yourself, be at peace with all men.

19. Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to wrath; for it is written, Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, says the Lord.

20. Therefore if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head.

21. Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

## Romans 13

1. Let every soul be subject to the higher authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are ordained by God.

2. Therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will receive judgment on themselves.

3. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same.

4. For he is Gods minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is Gods minister, an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil.

5. Therefore it is necessary to be subject, not only because of wrath but also because of conscience.

6. For because of this you also pay taxes, for they are Gods ministers attending continually to this very thing.

7. Render therefore to all their due: taxes to whom taxes are due, customs to whom customs, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor.

8. Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the Law.

9. For: Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not covet; and if there is any other commandment, all are summed up in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.

10. Love does no evil to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the Law.

11. And do this, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed.

12. The night is far spent, the day is at hand. Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.

13. Let us walk decently, as in the day, not in carousings and drunkenness, not in cohabitation and licentiousness, not in strife and envy.

14. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts.

## Romans 14

1. Receive one who is weak in the faith, but not to disputes over doubtful thoughts.

2. For one believes he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables.

3. Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats; for God has received him.

4. Who are you to judge anothers servant? To his own master he stands or falls. Indeed, he will be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand.

5. One person esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Let each be fully assured in his own mind.

6. He who regards the day, regards it to the Lord; and he who does not regard the day, to the Lord he does not regard it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he who does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks.

7. For none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself.

8. For if we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lords.

9. For to this end Christ died and rose and lived again, that He might be Lord over both the dead and the living.

10. But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you treat your brother as being of no account? For everyone shall appear before the judgment seat of Christ.

11. For it is written: As I live, says the Lord, Every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God.

12. So then each of us shall give account concerning himself to God.

13. Therefore let us not judge one another anymore, but rather resolve this, not to put a stumbling block or a snare in our brothers way.

14. I know and am convinced by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself; but to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.

15. Yet if your brother is grieved because of your food, you are no longer walking in love. Do not destroy with your food the one for whom Christ died.

16. Therefore do not let your good be spoken of as evil;

17. for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

18. For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men.

19. Therefore let us pursue the things of peace and the things that build up one another.

20. Do not bring to naught the work of God on account of food. All things indeed are pure, but it is evil for the man whose eating causes a stumbling block.

21. It is good not to eat flesh nor drink wine nor do anything by which your brother stumbles or is enticed to sin or is made weak.

22. Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Blessed is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.

23. But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it is not out of faith; for whatever is not out of faith is sin.

## Romans 15

1. We then who are strong ought to bear with the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.

2. Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to building up.

3. For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, The reproaches of those who reproached You fell on Me.

4. For whatever things were written before were written for our instruction, that we through the patience and encouragement of the Scriptures might have hope.

5. Now may the God of patience and comfort grant you to be of the same mind toward one another, according to Christ Jesus,

6. that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

7. Therefore receive one another, just as Christ also received us, to the glory of God.

8. Now I say that Jesus Christ has become a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises unto the fathers,

9. and that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy, as it is written: For this reason I will confess to You among the Gentiles, and sing unto Your name.

10. And again he says: Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people.

11. And again: Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles. Praise Him, all you peoples.

12. And again, Isaiah says: There shall be a root of Jesse; and He who shall rise to reign over the Gentiles, in Him the Gentiles shall hope.

13. Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.

14. Now I myself am confident concerning you, my brethren, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.

15. Nevertheless, brethren, I have written more boldly to you on some points, as reminding you, because of the grace given to me by God,

16. that I might be a minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.

17. Therefore I have reason to exult in Christ Jesus in the things which pertain to God.

18. For I will not dare to speak of anything which Christ has not accomplished through me, unto the obedience of the Gentiles in word and deed;

19. in mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem and round about to Illyricum I have fulfilled the preaching of the gospel of Christ.

20. And so I have striven to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, so that I should not build on another mans foundation,

21. but as it is written: To whom He was not announced, they shall see; and those who have not heard shall understand.

22. For this reason I also have been much hindered from coming to you.

23. But now no longer having a place in these regions, and having a great desire these many years to come to you,

24. whenever I may journey to Spain, I shall come to you; for I hope to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my way there by you, if first I may be filled with your company briefly.

25. But now I am going to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.

26. For it pleased those from Macedonia and Achaia to make certain gifts for the poor among the saints who are in Jerusalem.

27. For it seemed good to them, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been partakers of their spiritual things, it is also their duty to minister to them in carnal things.

28. Therefore, when I have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit, I shall go through you to Spain.

29. But I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.

30. Now I exhort you, brethren, through the Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in prayers to God on my behalf,

31. that I may be delivered from those in Judea who are disobedient, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,

32. that I may come to you with joy through the will of God, and may be refreshed together with you.

33. Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.

## Romans 16

1. I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church in Cenchrea,

2. that you may receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and assist her in whatever business she has need of you; for indeed she has been a helper of many and of myself also.

3. Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,

4. who risked their own necks for my life, to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.

5. Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Greet my beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.

6. Greet Mary, who labored much for us.

7. Greet Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.

8. Greet Amplias, my beloved in the Lord.

9. Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved.

10. Greet Apelles, approved in Christ. Greet those of Aristobulus.

11. Greet Herodion, my kinsman. Greet those who are of Narcissus who are in the Lord.

12. Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, who have labored in the Lord. Greet the beloved Persis, who labored much in the Lord.

13. Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.

14. Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren who are with them.

15. Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.

16. Greet one another with a holy kiss. The churches of Christ greet you.

17. Now I exhort you, brethren, note those who cause divisions and snares, contrary to the doctrine which you learned, and turn away from them.

18. For those who are such do not serve our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly, and by smooth words and flattering speech deceive the hearts of the simple.

19. For your obedience has reached to everyone. Therefore I rejoice over you. But I want you to be wise unto what is good, and simple toward evil.

20. And the God of peace will trample Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

21. Timothy, my fellow worker, and Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, greet you.

22. I, Tertius, who wrote this epistle, greet you in the Lord.

23. Gaius, my host and the host of the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the treasurer of the city, greets you, and Quartus, a brother.

24. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

25. Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery kept silent since the world began,

26. but now has been made manifest, and by the prophetic Scriptures has been made known to all nations, according to the commandment of the eternal God, for obedience to the faith;

27. to God, alone wise, be glory through Jesus Christ forever. Amen.
