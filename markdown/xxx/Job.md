# Job

## Job 1

1. There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and the man was perfect and upright, and one who feared God and turned away from evil.

2. And seven sons and three daughters were born to him.

3. Also, his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the East.

4. And his sons went and prepared feasts in their houses, each on his appointed day, and sent and invited their three sisters to eat and drink with them.

5. So it was, when the days of feasting had made the rounds, that Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts. Thus Job did over time.

6. Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, and Satan also came among them.

7. And Jehovah said to Satan, From where do you come? So Satan answered Jehovah and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking about on it.

8. Then Jehovah said to Satan, Have you set your heart on My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil?

9. So Satan answered Jehovah and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?

10. Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock have flourished in the land.

11. However, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and will he not curse You to Your face!

12. And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, all that he has is in your hand; only do not stretch forth your hand upon him. So Satan went out from the presence of Jehovah.

13. Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the firstborn brothers house;

14. and a messenger came to Job and said, The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,

15. when the Sabeans fell upon them and took them away; indeed they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and only I alone am escaped to tell you!

16. While he was still speaking, another also came and said, The fire of God has fallen from the heavens and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and only I alone am escaped to tell you!

17. While he was still speaking, another also came and said, The Chaldeans formed three bands, rushed in upon the camels and took them away, yea, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and only I alone am escaped to tell you!

18. While he was still speaking, another also came and said, Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the firstborn brothers house,

19. and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead; and only I alone am escaped to tell you!

20. Then Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head; and he fell down upon the ground and prostrated himself;

21. and he said: Naked I have come from my mothers womb, and naked shall I return there. Jehovah has given, and Jehovah has taken away; blessed is the name of Jehovah.

22. In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with folly.

## Job 2

1. Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, and Satan came also among them to present himself before Jehovah.

2. And Jehovah said to Satan, From where do you come? So Satan answered Jehovah and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking about on it.

3. Then Jehovah said to Satan, Have you set your heart on My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to swallow him up without cause.

4. So Satan answered Jehovah and said, Skin for skin! Yea, all that a man has he will give for his soul.

5. But stretch out Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse You to Your face!

6. And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, he is in your hand, but keep his soul alive.

7. So Satan went out from the presence of Jehovah, and struck Job with malignant inflammation from the sole of his foot to the top of his head.

8. And he took a potsherd with which to scrape himself; and he sat down in the middle of the ashes.

9. Then his wife said to him, Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse God and die!

10. But he said to her, You speak as one of the foolish ones speak. Shall we indeed receive good from God, and shall we not accept adversity? In all this Job did not sin with his lips.

11. Now when Jobs three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, each one came from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment together to come and show sympathy for him, and to comfort him.

12. And when they lifted up their eyes from afar, and did not recognize him, they lifted up their voices and wept; and each one tore his robe and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the heavens.

13. So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.

## Job 3

1. After this Job opened his mouth and cursed his day.

2. And Job answered, and said:

3. Let the day perish in which I was born, and the night in which it was said, A male child has been conceived.

4. Let that day be darkness; let God above not inquire after it, nor the light shine upon it.

5. Let darkness and the shadow of death redeem it; let a cloud settle on it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.

6. As for that night, let darkness take it away; let it not rejoice among the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.

7. Lo, let that night be barren! Let no joyful shout come into it!

8. Let those curse it who curse the day, those who are ready to stir up Leviathan.

9. Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it look for light, but have none, and not see the eyelids of the dawn;

10. because it did not shut up the doors of my mothers womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes.

11. Why did I not die from the womb? Why did I not expire when I came forth from the belly?

12. Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should suck?

13. For now I would have lain down and been quiet, I would have slept; then I would have been at rest

14. with kings and counselors of the earth, who built desolate places for themselves;

15. or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.

16. Or why was I not concealed like a miscarriage, like infants who never saw the light?

17. There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.

18. There the prisoners are at ease together; they do not hear the voice of the oppressor.

19. The small and great are there, and the slave is free from his master.

20. Why is light given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,

21. who long for death, but it does not come, and search for it more than hidden treasures;

22. who are joyful with exultation, and are glad when they meet the grave;

23. or to a man whose way is concealed, whom God has covered?

24. For my sighing comes before my food, and my groanings pour out like waters.

25. For the thing I had dreaded with terror has come upon me, and what I had feared has come to me.

26. I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest, for turmoil came.

## Job 4

1. Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:

2. If one attempts a word with you, will you become weary? But who can restrain words?

3. Surely you have instructed many, and you have strengthened weak hands.

4. Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, and you have strengthened the feeble knees.

5. But now it comes upon you, and you are weary; it touches you, and you are dismayed.

6. Is not your reverence your confidence? And the integrity of your ways your hope?

7. Remember now, who ever perished being innocent? Or where were the upright ever cut off?

8. Even as I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same.

9. By the breath of God they perish, and by the breath of His nostrils they are destroyed.

10. The roaring of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions are broken.

11. The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.

12. Now a word was brought to me by stealth, and my ear received a whisper of it.

13. In the uncertainties from the visions of the night, when a man falls into deep sleep,

14. fear and trembling befell me, which made all my bones dread.

15. Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair on my flesh stood up.

16. It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes in silence; then I heard a voice saying:

17. Is mortal man more righteous than God? Is a strong man more pure than his Maker?

18. Behold He puts no trust in His servants, and He charges His angels with error;

19. even more so those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the grass!

20. They are crushed from morning till evening; they perish forever, with no one regarding.

21. Is not their own excellence within them removed? They die, even without wisdom.

## Job 5

1. Call out now. Is there anyone who will answer you? And to which of the holy ones will you turn?

2. For anger kills a foolish man, and jealousy slays a simple one.

3. I have seen the foolish taking root, but suddenly I cursed his dwelling place.

4. His sons are far from safety, they are crushed in the gate, and there is no one to rescue them.

5. The hungry eat up his harvest, taking it even from the thorns, and a snare snatches their wealth.

6. For affliction does not come forth from the dust, nor does trouble spring up out of the ground;

7. yet man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward.

8. But indeed, I would seek the Mighty God, and before God I would lay out my case;

9. who does great things, and unsearchable, marvelous things without number:

10. He gives rain upon the face of the earth, and sends waters abroad;

11. He sets the lowly on high, and those who mourn are exalted to safety;

12. He frustrates the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot bring about their success;

13. He catches the wise in their own craftiness, and the counsel of the twisted is precipitated.

14. They meet with darkness by day, and grope at midday as in the night.

15. But He saves the needy from the sword, from the mouth of the mighty, and from their hand.

16. So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts her mouth.

17. Behold, blessed is the man whom God corrects; therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.

18. For He bruises, but He binds up; He shatters, but His hands heal.

19. He will deliver you in six troubles; yea, in seven no evil shall touch you:

20. In famine He shall redeem you from death, and in war from the power of the sword.

21. You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, and you shall not be afraid of devastation when it comes.

22. You shall laugh at devastation and famine, and you shall not be afraid of the beasts of the earth.

23. For you shall have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.

24. You shall know that your tent is in peace; you shall visit your dwelling and find nothing amiss.

25. You shall also know that your seed shall be many, and your offspring like the grass of the earth.

26. You shall come to the grave in full vigor, as a sheaf of grain springs up in its season.

27. Behold, this we have searched out; it is true. Hear and know it for yourself.

## Job 6

1. Then Job answered and said:

2. Oh, that my grief were fully weighed, and my calamity laid with it on the scales!

3. For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash.

4. For the arrows of the Almighty are within me; my spirit drinks in their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me.

5. Does the wild ass bray when it has grass, or does the ox low over its fodder?

6. Can something tasteless be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?

7. My soul refuses to touch them; they are as sickening food.

8. Oh, that I might have my request, that God would grant me the thing that I long for;

9. that it would please God to crush me, that He would loose His hand and cut me off!

10. Then I would still have comfort; though in anguish, I would leap for joy; let Him not spare; for I have not hidden the Words of the Holy One.

11. What strength do I have, that I should hope? And what is my end, that I should prolong my life?

12. Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh bronze?

13. Is my help not within me? And is wisdom driven from me?

14. To him who is despairing, kindness should be shown by his friend; but he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.

15. My brothers have dealt deceitfully. Like a brook, like the streams of the brooks, they pass away;

16. which are dark because of the ice, and into which the snow vanishes.

17. When it is warm, they stop flowing; when it is hot, they dry up from their place.

18. The paths of their journey are winding; they go into nothingness and vanish.

19. The wanderers of Tema have paid attention; the travelers of Sheba have looked for them.

20. They are disappointed because they had been confident, but when they had come there they were abashed.

21. Surely now you are nothing; you see terror and are afraid.

22. Did I ever say, Bring something to me? Or, Offer a bribe for me from your wealth?

23. Or, Deliver me from the hand of the adversary? Or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?

24. Teach me, and I will keep silent; cause me to understand in what way I have erred.

25. Right words are grievous, but what does your rebuke prove?

26. Do you intend to rebuke the words and the speeches of one in despair, as wind?

27. Yea, you throw down the fatherless, and dig a pit for your friend.

28. Now therefore, be pleased to look at me; for my face will tell if I am lying.

29. Turn back, let there be no injustice! Yea, turn back; my righteousness still stands!

30. Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern calamity?

## Job 7

1. Is there not warfare for man on earth? Are not his days also like the days of a hired man?

2. Like a servant who pants for the shade, and like a hired man who waits eagerly for his wages,

3. so I have been allotted months of futility, and restless nights have been appointed to me.

4. When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise from the long night? For I have had my fill of tossing until the twilight of the dawn.

5. My flesh is clothed with worms and clods, my skin is hardened and cracked and oozes.

6. My days are swifter than a weavers shuttle, and are used up without hope.

7. O remember that my life is a breath; my eye will never return to see good.

8. The eye of him who sees me shall watch me no more; while your eyes are upon me, I am not.

9. As the cloud vanishes and goes away, so he who goes down to Sheol does not come up.

10. He shall never again return to his house, nor shall his place know him anymore.

11. Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the distress of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.

12. Am I a sea, or a sea serpent, that You set a guard over me?

13. When I say, My bed will comfort me, my couch will ease my complaint,

14. then You scare me with dreams and terrify me with visions,

15. so that my soul chooses strangling and death rather than my body.

16. I loathe my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone, for my days are but a breath.

17. What is man, that You should magnify him, that You should set Your heart upon him,

18. that You should visit him every morning, and try him every moment?

19. How long will You not look away from me, and let me alone until I swallow my spittle?

20. Have I sinned? What have I done to You, O Watcher of men? Why have You set me as Your target, so that I am a burden to myself?

21. Why then do You not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? For now I will lie down in the dust, and You shall seek me diligently, but I will no longer be.

## Job 8

1. Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:

2. How long will you speak these things, and the words of your mouth be like a strong wind?

3. Does the Mighty God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?

4. If your sons have sinned against Him, He has cast them away for their transgression.

5. If you would earnestly seek the Mighty God and make your supplication to the Almighty,

6. if you were pure and upright, surely now He would awake for you, and would have restored your righteous abode.

7. Though your beginning was small, yet your latter end would increase abundantly.

8. For inquire now of the former generation, and prepare to search the fathers;

9. for we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days on earth are a shadow.

10. Shall they not teach you and tell you, and utter words from their heart?

11. Can the rush grow up without a marsh? Can the reeds grow without water?

12. While it is yet green and not cut down, it dries up before any other plant.

13. So are the paths of all who forget the Mighty God; and the hope of the ungodly shall perish,

14. whose confidence shall be cut off, and whose trust as a spiders house.

15. He leans on his house, but it does not stand. He holds it fast, but it does not endure.

16. He is moist before the sun, and his shoots spread out in his garden.

17. His roots are wrapped around a heap; he sees a house of stones.

18. If he is swallowed up from his place, then it will deny him, saying, I have not seen you.

19. Behold, this is the joy of His way, and out of the earth others shall grow.

20. Behold, the Mighty God will not cast away the perfect, nor will His hand support evildoers.

21. He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with rejoicing.

22. Those who hate you shall be clothed with shame, and the tent of the wicked will come to nothing.

## Job 9

1. Then Job answered and said:

2. Truly I know it is so; but how can a man be just before the Mighty God?

3. If one wished to contend with Him, he could not answer Him one time out of a thousand.

4. He is wise in heart and mighty in strength. Who has hardened himself against Him and been at peace?

5. He removes the mountains, and they do not know when He overturns them in His anger;

6. He shakes the earth out of its place, and its pillars tremble;

7. He commands the sun, and it does not rise; He seals up the stars;

8. He alone spreads out the heavens, and treads upon the waves of the sea;

9. He made the Ursa Major, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the chambers of the south;

10. He does great things past finding out, yea, wonders without number.

11. If He passes by me, I do not see Him; if He moves past, I do not perceive Him.

12. If He takes away, who can repulse Him? Who can say to Him, What are You doing?

13. The Mighty God will not withdraw His anger; those who help the proud lie prostrate beneath Him.

14. How then can I answer Him, and choose my words before Him?

15. For though I had been righteous, I could not answer Him; I would beg mercy of my Judge.

16. If I had called and He answered me, I would not believe that He had heard the voice of my prayer.

17. For He crushes me with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds without cause.

18. He will not allow me to catch my breath, but fills me with bitterness.

19. If it is a matter of strength, indeed He is strong; and if of justice, who will appoint my meeting?

20. Though I were righteous, my own mouth would condemn me; though I were perfect, it would prove me perverse.

21. Though I were perfect, yet I do not know my soul; I despise my life.

22. It is all one; therefore I have said, He destroys the perfect and the wicked.

23. If the scourge slays suddenly, He mocks at the despair of the innocent.

24. The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of its judges. If it is not He, then who is it?

25. Now my days are swifter than a runner; they flee away, they see no good.

26. They pass by like swift ships, like an eagle swooping on its food.

27. If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face and wear a smile,

28. I am afraid of all my pain; I know that You will not hold me innocent.

29. If I am guilty, why then do I labor in vain?

30. If I wash myself with snow water, and cleanse my hands with soap,

31. yet You will plunge me into the pit, and my own clothes would abhor me.

32. For He is not a man, as I am, that I may answer Him, and that we should come together in judgment.

33. Nor is there any mediator between us, who may lay his hand on us both.

34. Let Him take His rod away from me, and do not let the dread of Him terrify me.

35. Then I would speak and not fear Him; but it is not so with me.

## Job 10

1. My soul loathes my life; I will leave behind my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.

2. I will say to God, Do not condemn me; show me why You contend with me.

3. Has it been delightful to You that You oppress, that You despise the work of Your hands, and have shone on the counsel of the wicked?

4. Do You have eyes of flesh? Or do You see as man sees?

5. Are Your days like the days of mortal man? Are Your years like the days of a mighty man,

6. that You should seek out my iniquity and search out my sin,

7. although You know that I am not wicked, and there is no one who can rescue out of Your hand?

8. Your hands have made me and fashioned me together all around; yet You swallow me up.

9. Remember, I beseech You, that You have made me like clay. And will You bring me back and return me to dust?

10. Did you not pour me out like milk, and curdle me like cheese?

11. You clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews.

12. You have granted me life and favor, and Your care has preserved my spirit.

13. And these things You have hidden in Your heart; I have known that this was with You.

14. If I have sinned, then You have kept watch over me, and will not acquit me of my iniquity.

15. If I have been wicked, woe to me! And if I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head; I am full of disgrace. Pay attention to my affliction!

16. If I am exalted, You hunt me like a lion, and return to show Yourself wondrously to me.

17. You renew Your witnesses against me, and increase Your indignation toward me; changes and war are with me.

18. Why then have You brought me out of the womb? Oh, that I had expired and no eye had seen me!

19. I would have been as though I had not been. I would have been carried from the womb to the grave.

20. Are not my days few? Then cease and leave me alone, that I may take a little comfort

21. before I go and not return; to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;

22. a land of darkness and gloom, as the shadow of death, without any order; where it shines as darkness.

## Job 11

1. Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:

2. Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man giving lip be justified?

3. Should your empty talk make men hold their peace? And when you mock, should no one make you ashamed?

4. For you have said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in Your eyes.

5. But oh that God would speak, and open His lips against you,

6. that He would show you the secrets of wisdom! For they would double your wisdom. Know therefore that God forgets some of your iniquity.

7. Can you search and find out God? Can you find out the limits of the Almighty?

8. They are higher than the heavens; what can you do? Deeper than Sheol; what can you know?

9. Their measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea.

10. If He passes by, imprisons, and gathers together, then who can repulse Him?

11. For He knows the vanity of men; He sees wickedness also. Will He not then consider it?

12. For an empty-headed man will be wise, when a wild asss colt is born a man.

13. If you have prepared your heart, and spread out your hands toward Him;

14. if iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in your tents.

15. Then surely you shall lift up your face without blemish; yea, you shall be steadfast, and not fear;

16. because you shall forget your misery, and remember it as waters that have passed away,

17. and your lifetime shall arise more than the brightness of the noonday. Though you were dark, you shall be like the morning.

18. And you shall be secure, because there is hope; yea, you shall dig around you, and rest in safety.

19. You shall also lie down, and no one shall cause you to tremble; yea, many shall entreat your favor.

20. But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and their place of escape shall perish; and their hope, as the expiring of the soul!

## Job 12

1. Then Job answered and said:

2. Truly you are the people, and wisdom will die with you!

3. But I have a heart as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Indeed, who does not know such things as these?

4. I am one as a laughingstock to his friends; one who called upon God, and He answered him; the just and whole one is a laughingstock.

5. A lamp is despised in the thoughts of one who is at ease; it is made ready for those whose feet slip.

6. The tents of plunderers prosper, and those who provoke the Mighty God are secure, as God brings into his hand.

7. But now ask the beasts, and they will teach you; and the birds of the heavens, and they will tell you;

8. or speak to the earth, and it will teach you; and the fish of the sea shall recount to you.

9. Who among all these does not know that the hand of Jehovah has done this,

10. in whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all the flesh of mankind?

11. Does not the ear test words and the mouth taste its food?

12. Wisdom is with old men, and with length of days is understanding.

13. With Him are wisdom and strength, He has counsel and understanding.

14. Behold, He breaks down, and it cannot be rebuilt; He imprisons a man, and there can be no release.

15. Behold, He withholds the waters, and they dry up; He sends them out, and they transform the earth.

16. With Him are strength and wisdom; the deceived and the deceiver are His.

17. He causes counselors to walk away barefoot, and makes fools of the judges.

18. He loosens the bonds of kings, and binds their loins with a waistband.

19. He causes the priests to walk away barefoot, and overthrows the mighty.

20. He removes the lips of the trusted ones, and takes away the discretion of the elders.

21. He pours contempt upon nobles, and drops the girdle off hollow bones.

22. He reveals deep dark mysteries, and brings out the deep darkness into the light of day.

23. He makes nations great, and destroys them; He spreads out nations, and guides them.

24. He takes away the heart of the heads of the people of the earth, and makes them wander in a wilderness with no path.

25. They grope in the darkness without light, and He makes them stagger like a drunkard.

## Job 13

1. Behold, my eye has seen all this, my ear has heard and understood it.

2. What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.

3. But I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to argue with the Mighty God.

4. But you smear lies; you are all worthless physicians.

5. O that you would be silent and stop talking, and it would be your wisdom!

6. Now listen to my arguments, and pay attention to the complaint of my lips.

7. Will you speak unjustly for the Mighty God, and talk deceitfully for Him?

8. Will you show partiality for Him? Will you contend for the Mighty God?

9. Will it be well when He searches you out? Or do you mock Him as one mocks a man?

10. He will surely rebuke you if you secretly show partiality.

11. Will not His loftiness make you afraid, and the dread of Him fall upon you?

12. Your remembered proverbs are worthless; your backs are backs of clay.

13. Keep quiet, let me be, that I may speak; then let pass over me what will!

14. Why do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my soul in my hands?

15. Though He slay me, yet will I wait for Him; but I will prove my own ways before Him.

16. He also is my salvation, for a hypocrite can not come before Him.

17. Listen and pay attention to my speech; to my declaration with your ears.

18. Behold now, I have prepared my case; I know that I shall be justified.

19. Who is he who will contend with me? For if I am silent, I will die.

20. Only two things do not do to me, O God, then I will not hide myself from Your face:

21. Remove Your hand far from me, and let not the dread of You make me afraid.

22. Then call, and I will answer; or let me speak, and You respond to me.

23. How many are my iniquities and sins? Make me know my transgression and my sin.

24. Why do You hide Your face, and regard me as Your enemy?

25. Will You terrify a leaf driven to and fro? And will You pursue dry stubble?

26. For You write bitter things against me, and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth.

27. You put my feet in the stocks, and watch all my paths. You set a limit for the soles of my feet;

28. worn out like a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten.

## Job 14

1. Man who is born of woman is of few days, and full of turmoil.

2. He comes forth like a flower and is cut off; he flees like a shadow and does not remain.

3. And do You open Your eyes on such a one, and bring me into judgment with Yourself?

4. Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? No one!

5. Since his days are determined, the number of his months is with You; You have appointed his limits, so that he cannot pass beyond it.

6. Look away from him that he may rest, so like a hired man he may be satisfied with his day.

7. For there is hope for a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and its tender shoots will not cease.

8. Though its root grows old in the earth, and its stump dies in the ground,

9. yet at the scent of water it will bud and bring forth branches like a plant.

10. But a strong man dies and is laid away; indeed man expires and where is he?

11. As water evaporates from the sea, and a river wastes away and dries up,

12. so man lies down and does not rise. Until the heavens are no more, they shall not awake nor be aroused from their sleep.

13. O that You would hide me in Sheol, that You would conceal me until Your wrath is turned back, that You would appoint me a decree, and remember me!

14. If a man dies, shall he revive? All the days of my service I will wait, until my change comes.

15. You shall call, and I will answer You; You shall long for the work of Your hands.

16. For now You number my steps. Do you not watch over my sin?

17. My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and You cover my iniquity.

18. But as a mountain falls and crumbles away, and as a rock is moved out of its place;

19. as waters wear away stones, and as floods wash away the dust of the earth; so You destroy the hope of man.

20. You overpower him forever, and he passes on; You change his countenance and send him away.

21. His sons come to honor, and he does not recognize them; they are diminished, and he does not perceive it.

22. But his flesh will be in pain, and his soul will mourn.

## Job 15

1. Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:

2. Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?

3. Should he reason with speech that is not useful, or with words which do not profit?

4. Yea, you cast off fear, and restrain meditation before the Mighty God.

5. For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the tongue of the crafty.

6. Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; yea, your own lips testify against you.

7. Are you the first man who was born? Or were you made before the hills?

8. Have you heard the counsel of God? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?

9. What do you know that we do not know? What do you understand that is not in us?

10. Both the grayheaded and the aged are among us, much older than your father.

11. Are the consolations of the Mighty God of little worth to you? Do you have secret words?

12. Why does your heart carry you away, and what do your eyes wink at,

13. that you turn your spirit against the Mighty God, and let such words go out of your mouth?

14. What is man, that he should be pure? And he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?

15. If God puts no trust in His saints, and the heavens are not pure in His sight;

16. how much more abhorrent and corrupt is man, who drinks injustice like water!

17. I will tell you; hear me, and what I have seen I will declare,

18. what wise men have told, not hiding anything received from their fathers,

19. to whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them:

20. The wicked man writhes with pain all his days, and the number of years is stored up for the ruthless.

21. Dreadful sounds are in his ears; during peace, devastation comes upon him.

22. He does not believe that he will return from darkness, for a sword watches for him.

23. He wanders about for bread, saying, where is it? He knows that the day of darkness is ready at hand.

24. Adversity and distress terrify him; they overpower him, like a king ready for the attack.

25. For he stretches out his hand against the Mighty God, and acts defiantly against the Almighty,

26. running with stiff neck against Him with his thick, embossed shield.

27. He has covered his face with his fatness, and made his waist heavy with fat.

28. He dwells in desolate cities, in houses which no one inhabits, which are ready to become heaps.

29. He will not be rich, nor will his wealth endure, nor shall his possessions overspread the earth.

30. He shall not depart from darkness; the flame shall dry out his branches, and by the breath of His mouth he shall be removed.

31. Let not him who wanders about trust in vanity, for vanity shall be his recompense.

32. It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.

33. He will shake off his unripe grape like the vine, and cast off his blossom like the olive.

34. For the company of hypocrites shall be barren, and fire will consume the tents of bribery.

35. They conceive trouble and bring forth iniquity; their womb prepares deceit.

## Job 16

1. Then Job answered and said:

2. I have heard many such things; miserable comforters are you all!

3. Is there no end to windy words? What ails you that you answer thus?

4. I also could speak as you do, if your soul were in the place of my soul. I could heap up words against you, and shake my head at you.

5. But I would assure you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips would be restrained.

6. When I speak, my pain is not relieved; and if I remain silent, how do I proceed?

7. But now He has exhausted me; you have devastated my company.

8. You have seized me as a witness; my deception rises up against me and testifies to my face.

9. He tears me in His wrath, and hates me; He gnashes at me with His teeth; my adversary sharpens His eyes at me.

10. They have gaped at me with their mouth, and struck me reproachfully on the cheek; they gather together against me.

11. The Mighty God has delivered me to the perverse, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.

12. I was at ease, but He has shattered me; He also has taken hold on my neck, and dashed me to pieces; He has set me up for His target.

13. His archers surround me; He pierces my heart and does not pity; He pours out my gall on the ground.

14. He breaks me with break upon break; He runs at me like a mighty man.

15. I have sewn sackcloth over my skin, and have thrust my horn into the dust.

16. My face is flushed from weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;

17. although no violence is in my hands, and my prayer is pure.

18. O earth, do not cover my blood, and let my cry have no resting place!

19. Even now, behold, my evidence is in Heaven, and my witness is on high.

20. My friends scorn me; my eyes pour out tears to God.

21. Oh, that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleads for the son of his friend!

22. For when the number of years have come, I shall go the way from which I shall not return.

## Job 17

1. My spirit is broken, my days are extinguished, the grave is ready for me.

2. Are not mockers with me? And does not my eye dwell on their rebellion?

3. Now put down a pledge for me with Yourself. Who is he who will strike hands with me?

4. For You have hidden their heart from understanding; therefore You will not exalt them.

5. He who speaks flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.

6. But He has made me a byword of the people, and I have become one in whose face men spit.

7. My eye has also grown dim because of sorrow, and all my members are like shadows.

8. Upright men are astonished at this, and the innocent stirs himself up against the hypocrite.

9. Yet the righteous will take hold on his way, and he who has clean hands shall increase strength.

10. But please, return and come back, all of you, for I do not find one wise man among you.

11. My days have past, my plans have been torn apart, even the thoughts of my heart.

12. They set the night for day. The light is near, they say, in the face of darkness.

13. If I wait for the grave as my house, if I make my bed in the darkness;

14. if I have said to corruption, You are my father, and to the worm, You are my mother and my sister;

15. where then is my hope? As for my hope, who shall see it?

16. They shall go down to the gates of Sheol; we shall have rest together in the dust.

## Job 18

1. Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:

2. How long till you put an end to words? Consider, and afterward we will speak.

3. Why are we counted as beasts, and considered vile in your eyes?

4. You who tear yourself in anger, shall the earth be forsaken for you? Or shall the rock be removed from its place?

5. The light of the wicked shall be extinguished, and the flame of his fire shall not shine.

6. The light shall be dark in his tent, and his lamp beside him shall be extinguished.

7. The steps of his strength shall be shortened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.

8. For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walks into a netting.

9. The snare takes him by the heel, and the noose takes hold of him.

10. A rope is hidden for him on the ground, and a trap for him in the path.

11. Terrors frighten him on every side, and have scattered him to his feet.

12. His strength is starved, and calamity is ready at his side.

13. It devours parts of his skin; the firstborn of death devours parts of his body.

14. He is drawn out of the security of his tent, and marched before the king of terrors.

15. What is not his dwells in his tent; brimstone is scattered on his dwelling.

16. His roots are dried up below, and his branch above is cut off.

17. The memory of him perishes from the earth, and he has no name on the face of the street.

18. He is driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.

19. He has neither offspring nor posterity among his people, nor any survivors in his dwellings.

20. Those in the west are astonished at his day, and those in the east are seized with horror.

21. Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him who does not know the Mighty God.

## Job 19

1. Then Job answered and said:

2. How long will you torment my soul, and break me in pieces with words?

3. These ten times you have reproached me; you are not ashamed that you have wronged me.

4. And if indeed I have erred, my error remains with me.

5. If indeed you magnify yourselves against me, and adjudge my reproach against me,

6. know then that God has bowed me, and has surrounded me with His net.

7. Behold, I cry out concerning injustice, but I am not heard. I cry aloud, but there is no justice.

8. He has fenced up my way, so that I cannot pass; and He has set darkness in my paths.

9. He has stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.

10. He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone; my hope He has uprooted like a tree.

11. He has also kindled His wrath against me, and He counts me as one of His enemies.

12. His troops come together and build up their road against me; they encamp all around my tent.

13. He has removed my brothers far from me, and my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.

14. My relatives have left, and my close friends have forgotten me.

15. Those who dwell in my house, and my maidservants, count me as a stranger; I am a foreigner in their eyes.

16. I have called my servant, but he does not answer; I implored him with my mouth.

17. My breath is loathsome to my wife, and I must entreat the favor of children for the sake of my own body.

18. Even young children despise me; I arise, and they speak against me.

19. My circle of friends have abhorred me, and those whom I have loved have turned against me.

20. My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.

21. Have pity on me! Have pity on me, O you my friends! For the hand of God has struck me!

22. Why do you persecute me as the Mighty God does, and are not satisfied with my flesh?

23. Oh, that my words were now written! Oh, that they were inscribed in a book!

24. That they were forever engraved on a rock with an iron pen and lead!

25. For I know that my Redeemer is alive, and He shall stand at the latter time upon the earth;

26. and after my skin has been struck off from my flesh, I shall see God:

27. Whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not a stranger. O how my reins have been exhausted within me!

28. If you should say, How shall we persecute him? since the root of the matter has been found in me,

29. fear for yourselves because of the sword; for wrath brings the punishment of the sword; that you may know there is judgment.

## Job 20

1. Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:

2. Therefore my uncertain thoughts make me answer, because of the anxiety within me.

3. I have heard the admonition against my reproaches, but the spirit of my understanding causes me to answer.

4. Do you not know this from of old, ever since man was placed upon earth,

5. that the rejoicing of the wicked is near its end, and the mirth of the hypocrite is but for a moment?

6. Though his haughtiness mounts up to the heavens, and his head reaches to the clouds,

7. yet he shall perish forever like his own dung; those who see him shall say, where is he?

8. He shall fly away like a dream, and not be found; yea, he shall be chased away like a vision of the night.

9. The eye that has seen him shall see him no more, nor will his place regard him anymore.

10. His children shall seek the favor of the poor, and his hands shall return his wealth.

11. His bones are full of his youthful vigor, but it shall lie down with him in the dust.

12. Though evil is sweet in his mouth, and he hides it under his tongue,

13. though he spares it and does not forsake it, but still keeps it in his mouth,

14. yet his food in his stomach has churned up; it is serpents venom within him.

15. He swallows down riches and vomits them up again; the Mighty God casts them out of his belly.

16. He shall suck the poison of serpents; the vipers tongue shall slay him.

17. He shall not see the streams, the rivers of honey and curds.

18. He shall give back that for which he labored, and shall not swallow it down; He shall have no enjoyment from the exchanges of his wealth.

19. For he has crushed and forsaken the poor, he has seized a house which he did not build.

20. Surely he has known no ease in his belly; he shall not save anything he desires.

21. No food is left for him; there is no travail after his well-being.

22. In the fullness of his scorn he shall be in distress; every hand of trouble shall come against him.

23. When he is about to fill his stomach, God will cast upon him the fury of His wrath, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.

24. If he flees from the iron weapon, a bronze bow shall pierce him through.

25. It has been drawn, and comes out the back; yea, the glittering point comes out of his gall. Terrors come upon him;

26. total darkness is his hidden treasure. An unfanned fire shall devour him; and any survivors in his tent shall tremble.

27. The heavens shall lay bare his iniquity, and the earth shall rise up against him.

28. The fruit of his house shall be removed, being poured out in the day of His wrath.

29. This is the portion from God for a wicked man, the heritage promised to him by the Mighty God.

## Job 21

1. Then Job answered and said:

2. Listen carefully to my speech, and let this be your consolation.

3. Bear with me that I may speak, and after I have spoken, mock on.

4. As for me, is my complaint against man? And if it were, why should my spirit not be impatient?

5. Look at me and be astonished; put your hand over your mouth.

6. Even when I remember I am terrified, and trembling takes hold of my flesh.

7. Why do the wicked live and become old, yea, and become mighty in power?

8. Their seed is established in their presence, and their offspring before their eyes.

9. Their houses are at peace, without dread; neither is the rod of God upon them.

10. Their bull has bred without failure; their cow calves and does not miscarry.

11. They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.

12. They sing to the tambourine and harp, and rejoice to the sound of the flute.

13. They spend their days in prosperity, and in a moment go down to Sheol.

14. Yet they say to the Mighty God, Depart from us, for we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways.

15. Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit do we have if we entreat Him?

16. Behold, their goodness is not in their hand! The counsel of the wicked is far from me.

17. How often is the lamp of the wicked put out! How often does their calamity come upon them, the sorrows God distributes in His anger!

18. They are like straw before the wind, and like chaff that a storm steals away.

19. God treasures up ones iniquity for his children. He recompenses him, that he may know it.

20. His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.

21. For what is his delight in his house after him, when the number of his months has been cut off?

22. Can anyone teach the Mighty God knowledge, since He judges those that are on high?

23. One dies in his full strength, being wholly secure and at ease;

24. his pails are full of milk, and the marrow of his bones is moist.

25. Another man dies in the bitterness of his soul, never having eaten with pleasure.

26. They lie down together in the dust, and worms cover them.

27. Behold, I know your thoughts, and the plots with which you would do me wrong.

28. For you say, Where is the house of the noble one? And where is the tent, the dwelling place of the wicked?

29. Have you not asked those who pass along the road? And do you not know their trademarks?

30. For the wicked are reserved for the day of calamity; they shall be brought out on the day of wrath.

31. Who declares his way to his face? And who repays him for what he has done?

32. Yet he shall be brought to the grave, and a vigil kept over the tomb.

33. The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him; everyone shall drag along after him, as countless ones before him.

34. How then do you comfort me with vanity, since treachery remains in your answers?

## Job 22

1. Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:

2. Can a man be of use to the Mighty God, as he who is wise may be profitable to himself?

3. Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that you are righteous? Or is it gain to Him that you make your ways perfect?

4. Is it because of your reverence that He corrects you, and enters into judgment with you?

5. Is not your wickedness great, and your iniquities without end?

6. For you have taken a pledge from your brother for no reason, and stripped the naked of their clothing.

7. You have not given the weary water to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry.

8. But the man of strength possesses the land, and the honorable man dwells in it.

9. You have sent widows away empty, and crushed the arms of the fatherless.

10. Therefore snares are all around you, and sudden dread terrifies you;

11. or darkness so that you cannot see; and an abundance of water covers you.

12. Is not God in the height of the heavens? And see the highest stars, how lofty they are!

13. And you say, What does the Mighty God know? Can He judge through the deep darkness?

14. Thick clouds cover Him, so that He cannot see, and He walks above the circle of the heavens.

15. Will you keep to the old way which wicked men have trod,

16. who were snatched away before their time, whose foundations were poured out by the flood?

17. They said to the Mighty God, Depart from us! What can the Almighty do to them?

18. Yet He filled their houses with good things. But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.

19. The righteous see it and are glad, and the innocent have them in derision:

20. Surely, are not our adversaries cut down; and the fire consumes their remnant.

21. Now be useful to Him, and be at peace; thereby good shall come to you.

22. Receive, now, the Law from His mouth, and lay up His Words in your heart.

23. If you return to the Almighty, you shall be built up; you shall remove injustice far from your tents.

24. Then you shall lay up your gold as the dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.

25. Yea, the Almighty will be your gold and your esteemed silver;

26. for then you shall have your delight in the Almighty, and lift up your face unto God.

27. You shall make your supplication to Him, He will hear you, and you shall make good your vows.

28. You shall also decree a thing, and it shall be confirmed for you; and light shall shine on your ways.

29. When you have been made low, then you will say in your heart, It was pride. Then He will save the lowly of eyes.

30. He will deliver one who is not innocent; yea, he will deliver by the purity of your hands.

## Job 23

1. Then Job answered and said:

2. Even today my complaint is bitter; my hand is heavy over my groaning.

3. Oh, that I knew where I might find Him, that I might come to His place!

4. I would present my case before Him, and fill my mouth with arguments.

5. I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would say to me.

6. Would He contend with me in His great power? No! But He would set me in place.

7. There the upright could reason with Him, and I would be delivered forever from my Judge.

8. Behold, I go forward, but He is not there, and backward, but I cannot perceive Him;

9. when He works on the left hand, I cannot see Him; when He turns to the right hand, I cannot perceive Him.

10. But He knows the way that I take; when He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold.

11. My foot has held fast to His steps; I have kept His way and not turned aside.

12. I have not departed from the Commandment of His lips; I have treasured the Words of His mouth more than my prescribed food.

13. But He is One, and who can turn Him back? And whatever His soul desires, that He does.

14. For He completes what is prescribed for me, and many such things are with Him.

15. Therefore I am terrified at His presence; when I consider this, I am in dread of Him.

16. For the Mighty God has made my heart weak, and the Almighty has terrified me.

17. But I have not been cut off by the face of darkness, and He has concealed the deep darkness from my face.

## Job 24

1. Since times are not hidden from the Almighty, why do those who know Him not see His days?

2. Some remove landmarks; they seize flocks and feed on them;

3. they drive away the donkey of the fatherless; they take the widows ox as a pledge.

4. They thrust away the needy out of the road; the poor of the land have been forced into hiding together.

5. Indeed, like wild donkeys in the desert, they go out to their work, searching for food. The wilderness yields food for them and for their young.

6. They gather their fodder in the field and glean in the vineyard of the wicked.

7. They lodge the naked without clothing, with no covering against the cold.

8. They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and hug the rock for want of shelter.

9. They seize the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge from the poor.

10. They cause them to go naked, without clothing; and they take away the sheaves from the hungry.

11. They press out oil within their walls, and tread winepresses, but are thirsty.

12. Men groan from the city, and the souls of the wounded cry out; yet God does not charge them with folly.

13. They rebel against the Light; they have not recognized its ways nor stayed in its paths.

14. The murderer rises at daylight; he kills the poor and needy; and in the night he is like a thief.

15. The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me; and puts a covering over his face.

16. In the dark they dig through into houses which they have marked for themselves by day; they do not know the light.

17. For the morning is the same to them as deep darkness; they know the terrors of deep darkness.

18. They are swift on the face of the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth; they do not turn into the way of the vineyards.

19. As drought and heat consume the snow waters, so Sheol consumes those who have sinned.

20. The womb shall forget him, the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be remembered no more, and injustice shall be broken like a tree.

21. He mistreats the barren who do not bear, and does no good to the widow.

22. He also draws the mighty away with his strength; he rises up, but no one is sure of life.

23. He gives them security, and they trust in it; yet His eyes are on their ways.

24. They are exalted for a little while, then they are gone. They are brought low; they are all drawn together out of the way, and cut off like heads of grain.

25. And if it is not so, who will prove me a liar, and make my speech worth nothing?

## Job 25

1. Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:

2. Dominion and fear belong to Him; He makes peace in His high places.

3. Is there any numbering of His armies? Upon whom does His light not rise?

4. How then can man be just before the Mighty God? Or how can one be pure who is born of a woman?

5. If even the moon does not shine, and the stars are not pure in His sight;

6. how much less man, who is a maggot; and the son of man, who is a worm!

## Job 26

1. But Job answered and said:

2. How have you helped him who is without power? How have you saved the arm that has no strength?

3. How have you counseled one who has no wisdom, or widely declared sound wisdom?

4. To whom have you uttered words? And whose spirit came from you?

5. The spirits of the dead wait anxiously under the waters, and those inhabiting them.

6. Sheol is naked before Him, and Abaddon has no covering.

7. He stretches out the north over empty space; He hangs the earth on nothing.

8. He binds up the waters in His thick clouds, yet the clouds are not split open under them.

9. He covers the face of His throne, and spreads His cloud over it.

10. He has encircled a boundary for the face of the waters at the edge of light and darkness.

11. The pillars of heaven tremble, and are astonished at His rebuke.

12. He has stirred up the sea with His power, and by His understanding has shattered the arrogant.

13. By His Spirit He has made the heavens beautiful; His hand has brought forth the fleeing serpent.

14. Lo, these are the extremities of His ways; yea, what a whisper of a word has been heard of Him! But the thunder of His might who can understand?

## Job 27

1. Moreover Job continued on with his discourse, and said:

2. As the Mighty God lives, who has taken away my justice, and the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter,

3. as long as my breath is in me, and the spirit of God in my nostrils,

4. my lips will not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.

5. Far be it from me that I should say you are right. Until I die I will not put away my integrity from me.

6. I hold fast to my righteousness, and will not let it go; my heart does not reproach any of my days.

7. Let my enemy be like the wicked, and he who rises up against me like the unrighteous.

8. For what is the hope of the hypocrite when he is cut off, when God draws out his soul?

9. Will the Mighty God hear his cry when distress comes upon him?

10. Will he delight in the Almighty? Will he always call upon God?

11. I will teach you about the hand of the Mighty God; that which is with the Almighty I will not hide.

12. Behold, all of you have seen it. Why then are you vain like a vapor?

13. This is the portion of a wicked man with the Mighty God, and the heritage of the ruthless, received from the Almighty:

14. If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword; and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.

15. Those who survive him shall be buried in death, and their widows shall not weep,

16. though he heaps up silver like dust, and provides clothing like clay;

17. he may provide it, but the just shall wear it, and the innocent shall divide up the silver.

18. He builds his house like a moth, like a booth which a watchman makes.

19. The rich man shall lie down, but not be gathered up; he has opened his eyes, and is not.

20. Terrors overtake him like waters; a tempest steals him away in the night.

21. The east wind carries him away, and he is gone; it whirls him out of his place.

22. It casts him out without pity; he hastens to flee from its hand.

23. Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.

## Job 28

1. Surely there is a source for silver, and a place where gold is refined.

2. Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted from stone.

3. Man puts an end to darkness, and searches every recess for stone in the gloom and deep darkness.

4. The torrent breaks out far from the sojourners; forgotten by the feet of men, they hang and swing to and fro.

5. As for the earth, from it comes bread, but underneath it is churned up like fire;

6. its stones are the source of sapphires, and it contains gold dust.

7. It is a path no bird knows, nor has the falcons eye caught sight of it.

8. The young of the majestic beasts have not trodden it, nor has the lion passed by it.

9. He has put his hand on the rock; He has overturned the mountains by the roots.

10. He cuts out streams in the rocks, and his eye sees every precious thing.

11. He has bound up the streams from flowing; He brings what is hidden out into the light.

12. But where can wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?

13. Man does not know its value, nor is it found in the land of the living.

14. The deep says, It is not in me; and the sea says, It is not with me.

15. It cannot be given for gold, nor can silver be weighed for its price.

16. It cannot be weighed against the gold of Ophir, the precious onyx or sapphire.

17. Neither gold nor crystal can be compared to it, nor can it be exchanged for articles of fine gold.

18. No mention shall be made of coral or crystal, for the acquiring of wisdom is above precious stones.

19. The topaz of Ethiopia cannot be compared to it, nor can it be weighed out for pure gold.

20. From where then does wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding?

21. It is hidden from the eyes of all living, and concealed from the birds of the heavens.

22. Abaddon and Death say, We have heard a report of it with our ears.

23. God understands its way, and He knows its place.

24. For He looks to the ends of the earth, and sees under the whole heavens,

25. to appoint a weight for the wind, and mete out the waters by measure.

26. When He made a decree for the rain, and a path for the thunderbolt,

27. then He saw and declared it; He prepared it, yea, He searched it out.

28. And to man He said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding.

## Job 29

1. Moreover Job continued on with his discourse, and said:

2. Oh, that I were as in months past, as in the days when God watched over me;

3. when His lamp shone upon my head, and when by His light I walked through darkness;

4. just as I was in my productive days, when the counsel of God was over my tent;

5. when the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were around me;

6. when my steps were bathed in butter, and the rock poured out rivers of oil for me;

7. when I went out to the gate through the city, when I set up my seat in the open square.

8. The young men saw me and hid, and the aged arose and stood up;

9. the rulers refrained from talking, and put their hand on their mouth;

10. the leaders hid their voice, and their tongue clung to the roof of their mouth.

11. When the ear heard, it blessed me, and when the eye saw, it bore witness to me;

12. because I delivered the poor who cried out, the fatherless and the one who had no one to help him.

13. The blessing of the dying man came upon me, and I caused the widows heart to sing for joy.

14. I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was like a robe and a turban.

15. I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.

16. I was a father to the needy, and I searched out the case that I did not know.

17. I broke the fangs of the perverse, and flung out the prey from his teeth.

18. Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and multiply my days as the sand.

19. My root was open to the waters, and the dew lay all night on my branch.

20. My glory was fresh within me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.

21. Men listened to me and waited, and kept silent for my counsel.

22. After my speech they did not change anything, and my words dropped upon them.

23. They waited for me as for the rain, and they opened their mouth wide as for the spring rain.

24. I laughed at them when they did not believe it, and did not allow the light of my countenance to fall.

25. I chose the way for them, and sat as chief; so I dwelt as a king among the troops, as one who comforts mourners.

## Job 30

1. But now they mock at me, men younger than I, whose fathers I have refused to put with the dogs of my flock.

2. Indeed, what profit is the strength of their hands to me? Their vigor has perished.

3. They are gaunt from want and famine, gnawing the dry ground recently made desolate and waste;

4. who pluck mallow by the bushes, and broom tree roots for their food.

5. They were driven out from the midst; they shouted at them as against a thief;

6. to dwell in the ravines of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and the rocks.

7. Among the bushes they brayed, under the nettles they huddled.

8. They were sons of fools, yea, sons without a name; they were scourged from the land.

9. And now I am their taunting song; yea, I am their byword.

10. They abhor me, they keep far from me; they do not refrain from spitting in my face.

11. Because He has loosed His bowstring and afflicted me, they have cast off restraint before me.

12. At my right hand the brood arises; they push away my feet, and they raise against me their ways of destruction.

13. They have broken up my path, they profit from my calamity; they have no helper.

14. They come as broad breakers; under the devastation they roll along.

15. Terrors are turned upon me; they pursue my honor as the wind, and my prosperity has vanished like a cloud.

16. And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction take hold of me.

17. My bones are pierced in me at night, and my gnawing pains take no rest.

18. By great force my garment is disfigured; it binds me about as the collar of my coat.

19. He has cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes.

20. I cry out to You, but You do not answer me; I stand up, and You pay no attention to me.

21. But You have changed to be cruel to me; with the strength of Your hand You oppose me.

22. You lift me up to the wind and cause me to ride on it; You dissipate me in the storm.

23. For I know that You will bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.

24. Surely He would not stretch out His hand against a heap of ruins. Behold, they cry out for help when He destroys it.

25. Have I not wept for him who had a hard day? Has not my soul grieved for the needy?

26. But when I looked for good, evil came; and when I waited for light, then came darkness.

27. My stomach has been upset and is not still; days of affliction have confronted me.

28. I have walked about in the dark, not in the sun; I have stood up in the assembly and cried out for help.

29. I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to the daughters of the owl.

30. My skin has grown black on me; my bones are burned with dryness.

31. My harp is turned to mourning, and my flute into the voice of those who weep.

## Job 31

1. I have made a covenant with my eyes; how then could I look intently upon a virgin?

2. For what is the portion from God above, and the inheritance of the Almighty from on high?

3. Is it not destruction for the wicked, and calamity for the workers of iniquity?

4. Does He not see my ways, and count all my steps?

5. If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot has hastened to deceit,

6. let me be weighed on just scales, that God may know my integrity.

7. If my step has turned aside from the way, or my heart walked after my eyes, or if any blemish has clung to my hands,

8. then let me sow, and another eat; yea, let my harvest be rooted out.

9. If my heart has been enticed by a woman, or if I have lurked at my neighbors door,

10. then let my wife grind for another, and let others bow down over her.

11. For that would be wickedness; yea, it would be perversity deserving of judgment.

12. For that would be a fire that devours to Abaddon, and would root out all my increase.

13. If I despised the cause of my male or female servant when they have a dispute with me,

14. what then shall I do when the Mighty God rises up? When He reviews my case, what shall I answer Him?

15. Did not He who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same One fashion us in the womb?

16. If I have withheld from the poor their desire, or caused the eyes of the widow to fail,

17. or eaten my morsel by myself, and the fatherless has not eaten of it

18. (when from my youth, as a father I have raised him, and from my mothers womb I guided her);

19. if I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, or any poor man without covering;

20. if his heart has not blessed me, and if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;

21. if I have waved my hand against the fatherless, when I was looking after my help in the gate;

22. then let my shoulder fall from my back, and let my arm be broken from the joint.

23. For calamity from the Mighty God is a terror to me, and because of His majesty I could not do such things.

24. If I have made gold my hope, or said to fine gold, you are my confidence;

25. if I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had acquired much;

26. if I have observed the sun when it shines, or the moon moving in splendor,

27. so that my heart has been secretly enticed, and my mouth has kissed my hand;

28. this also would be a perversity deserving of judgment, for I would have denied the Mighty God above.

29. If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me, or been excited when evil found him

30. (indeed I have not allowed my mouth to sin, to request a curse upon his soul);

31. if the men of my tent have not said, who is there that is not satisfied with his flesh?

32. (no sojourner had to pass the night in the street, for I have opened my doors to the traveler);

33. if I have covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom,

34. then let me fear the great multitude, and let the contempt of families terrify me, and I will keep silent and not go out of the door.

35. Oh, that I had one to hear me! Behold, my desire is that the Almighty would answer me, that the man complaining had written an indictment!

36. Surely I would carry it on my shoulder, and bind it on me like a crown;

37. I would declare to Him the number of my steps; like a prince I would approach Him.

38. If my land cries out against me, or its furrows weep together;

39. if I have eaten its produce without money, or caused its owners to expire their souls;

40. then let thistles come forth instead of wheat, and weeds instead of barley. The words of Job are finished.

## Job 32

1. So these three men ceased answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.

2. Then the wrath of Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled against Job; his wrath was kindled because he was justifying his soul more than God.

3. Also against his three friends his wrath was kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.

4. Now because they were years older than he, Elihu had waited for Job, to speak.

5. So when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, his wrath was kindled.

6. And Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, answered and said: I am young in years, and you are very old; therefore I have shrunk back, and out of respect for you, have not told my opinion.

7. I said, Age should speak, and multitude of years should declare wisdom.

8. But there is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty gives him understanding.

9. Great men are not always wise, nor do the aged always discern justice.

10. Therefore I have said, Listen to me; I also will declare my opinion.

11. Behold, I waited for your speech, I listened to your reasonings, while you searched out words.

12. Yea, I paid attention to you, and behold, not one of you proved Job wrong, nor answered his words;

13. lest you should say, We have found wisdom; the Mighty God will drive him out, not man.

14. Now he has not directed his words against me; so I will not answer him with your words.

15. They have been dismayed and answer no more; they have left off speaking.

16. And I have waited, because they did not speak, because they have stood still and answered no more.

17. I also will answer my share, I too will declare my opinion.

18. For I am full of words; the spirit within me has compelled me.

19. Behold, my belly is like wine that has no vent; it is about to split open like new wineskins.

20. I will speak, that I may find relief; I must open my lips and answer.

21. I will not show partiality to anyone, nor will I flatter any man.

22. For I do not know how to flatter, else my Maker would soon take me away.

## Job 33

1. But please, Job, hear my speech, and listen to all my words.

2. Behold, now I have opened my mouth; my tongue has spoken in my mouth.

3. My words come from my upright heart; my lips shall utter knowledge in purity.

4. The Spirit of the Mighty God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.

5. If you are able, answer me, set your words in order before me; take your stand.

6. Behold, I am as your spokesman before the Mighty God; I also have been formed out of clay.

7. Surely no fear of me will terrify you, nor shall my burden be heavy upon you.

8. Surely you have spoken in my ears, and I have heard the sound of your words, saying,

9. I am pure, without transgression; I am innocent, and there is no iniquity in me.

10. Yet He finds opposition in me, He counts me as His enemy;

11. He puts my feet in the stocks, He watches all my paths.

12. Behold, in this you have not been righteous. I will answer you, for God is greater than man.

13. Why do you contend with Him? For He does not give account to you of His business.

14. For the Mighty God may speak once or twice, yet no one regards it.

15. In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls upon men, while slumbering on their beds,

16. then He opens the ears of men, and seals their instruction.

17. In order to turn man from his deed, and conceal pride from man,

18. He keeps back his soul from the Pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.

19. Man is also chastened with pain on his bed, and with perpetual strife in his bones,

20. so that his life loathes bread, and his soul desirable food.

21. His flesh wastes away from sight, and his bones which once were not seen are laid bare.

22. Yea, his soul draws near the Pit, and his life to the executioners.

23. If there is a messenger for him, a mediator, one among a thousand, to declare for man his uprightness,

24. then let Him be gracious to him and say, Deliver him from going down to the Pit; I have found a ransom.

25. His flesh shall be fresh like a youths, he shall return to the days of his vigor.

26. He shall pray unto God, and He will delight in him; he shall see His face with joy, for He restores to man His righteousness.

27. Then he observes men and says, I have sinned, and perverted what was right; and it has not been equaled to me.

28. He has redeemed my soul from passing over to the Pit, and my life shall see the light.

29. Lo, the Mighty God works all these things twice or three times with a man,

30. to bring back his soul from the Pit, that he may be enlightened with the Light of Life.

31. Pay attention, Job, listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.

32. If you have anything to say, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify you.

33. If not, listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.

## Job 34

1. Elihu further answered and said:

2. Hear my words, you wise men; give ear to me, you who have knowledge.

3. For the ear examines words as the palate tastes food.

4. Let us choose justice for ourselves; let us know among ourselves what is good.

5. For Job has said, I am righteous, but the Mighty God has taken away my justice;

6. should I lie concerning my right? My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.

7. What man is like Job, who drinks up derision like water,

8. who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men?

9. For he has said, It profits a man nothing when he is pleasing to God.

10. Therefore listen to me, you men with heart: far be it from the Mighty God to do wickedness, and from the Almighty to do injustice.

11. For He repays man according to his work, and causes him to attain according to his way.

12. Surely the Mighty God will never do wickedly, nor will the Almighty pervert justice.

13. Who has given Him charge over the earth? Or who appointed Him over the whole world?

14. If He should set His heart on it, if He should gather to Himself His Spirit and His breath,

15. all flesh would perish together, and man would return to dust.

16. If you have understanding, hear this; listen to the sound of my words:

17. Shall one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn a righteous mighty one?

18. Is it fitting to say to a king, You are worthless; and to nobles, You are wicked?

19. He is not partial to rulers, nor does He regard the rich more than the poor; for they are all the work of His hands.

20. In a moment they die, in the middle of the night; people convulse and pass away; the mighty are taken away without a hand.

21. For His eyes are on the ways of man, and He sees all his steps.

22. There is no darkness nor shadow of death where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.

23. For He does not lay more upon man, that he should go before the Mighty God in judgment.

24. He breaks mighty men in pieces without inquiry, and makes others stand in their place.

25. Therefore he knows their works; He overthrows them in the night, and they are crushed.

26. He chastises them as wicked men, in a place where others can see,

27. because they have turned aside from following Him, and have not considered any of His ways,

28. so that they cause the cry of the poor to come to Him; for He hears the cry of the lowly.

29. When He gives quietness, who then can condemn? And when He hides His face, who then can see Him? It might be against a nation or mankind altogether,

30. so that the hypocrite should not reign, lest the people be ensnared.

31. For has anyone said to the Mighty God, I have endured; I will offend no more;

32. teach me what I do not see; if I have done injustice, I will do no more?

33. Shall He recompense on your terms, just because you have rejected it? You must choose, and not I; therefore speak what you know.

34. Men with heart say to me, wise men who listen to me:

35. Job speaks without knowledge, his words are without insight.

36. Oh, that Job were tried to the utmost, because his answers are like those of wicked men!

37. For he adds rebellion to his sin; he claps his hands among us, and multiplies his words against the Mighty God.

## Job 35

1. Moreover Elihu answered and said:

2. Do you think this is just? Do you say, I am more righteous than the Mighty God?

3. For you say, What advantage will it be to You? What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?

4. I will answer your words, and your friends with you.

5. Look to the heavens and see; and behold the clouds; they are higher than you.

6. If you sin, what do you do against Him? Or, if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to Him?

7. If you are righteous, what do you give Him? Or what does He receive from your hand?

8. Your wickedness is for a man such as yourself, and your righteousness a son of man.

9. Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; they cry out for help because of the arm of the mighty.

10. But no one says, Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,

11. who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?

12. There they cry out, but He does not answer, because of the arrogance of evil men.

13. Surely, the Mighty God will not listen to vanity, nor will the Almighty regard it.

14. Although you say you do not see Him, yet the case is before Him, and you must wait for Him.

15. And now, because He has not punished in His anger, nor taken notice of great folly,

16. therefore Job opens his mouth in vain; he multiplies words without knowledge.

## Job 36

1. Elihu also continued on and said:

2. Bear with me a little, and I will show you that there are yet words to speak on Gods behalf.

3. I will take away my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.

4. For truly my words are not false; the One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.

5. Behold, the Mighty God is great, and refuses no one; He is mighty in strength and heart.

6. He does not preserve the life of the wicked, but gives justice to the lowly.

7. He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous; but they are on the throne with kings, for He has seated them forever, and they are exalted.

8. And if they are bound in fetters, caught in cords of affliction,

9. then He declares to them their work and their transgressions; that they have acted proudly.

10. He also opens their ear to instruction, and commands that they turn back from iniquity.

11. If they obey and serve Him, they shall spend their days in good, and their years in pleasures.

12. But if they do not obey, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.

13. But the hypocrites in heart store up wrath; they do not cry for help when He has bound them.

14. Their soul dies in youth, and their life is among the male temple prostitutes.

15. He delivers the poor in their affliction, and opens their ears in oppression.

16. Indeed He would have brought you out of the mouth of distress, into a broad place where there is no constraint; and what is set on your table would be full of fatness.

17. But you are filled with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice take hold of you.

18. Beware wrath, lest He entice you away to a mocking slap; for a large ransom will not turn it away.

19. He will not esteem your cry for help, riches, strength or might.

20. Do not long for the night, when people retreat into their place.

21. Take heed and do not turn away to iniquity, for you have chosen this rather than affliction.

22. Behold, the Mighty God is exalted by His power; who teaches like Him?

23. Who has assigned Him His way, or who has said, You have done wrong?

24. Remember to magnify His work, of which men have sung.

25. Mankind has seen it; man regards it from afar.

26. Behold, the Mighty God is great, and we cannot find Him out; nor can the number of His years be searched out.

27. For He draws up drops of water, which distill as rain from the mist,

28. which the clouds drop down and pour abundantly upon man.

29. Also, can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds, the thunder from His canopy?

30. Behold, He has spread his light upon it, and has covered the bottom of the sea.

31. For by these He judges the peoples; He gives food in abundance.

32. He covers His hands with lightning, and gives charge to strike the mark.

33. His thunder declares it; the cattle also go up.

## Job 37

1. At this also my heart trembles, and leaps from its place.

2. Listen to hear the thunder of His voice, and the rumbling that comes out of His mouth.

3. He has let it loose under the whole heavens, His lightning unto the ends of the earth.

4. After it a voice roars; He thunders with His majestic voice, and He does not hold back when His voice is heard.

5. The Mighty God thunders marvelously with His voice; He does great things which we cannot comprehend.

6. For He says to the snow, Fall on the earth; likewise to the showers of rain and the showers of heavy rain.

7. He seals up the hand of every man, that all men may know His work.

8. The beasts go into dens, and remain in their lairs.

9. Out of the chamber comes the windstorm, and cold from the scattering winds.

10. By the breath of the Mighty God frost is given, and the expanse of the waters is frozen.

11. He also loads the thick clouds with moisture; He scatters His bright clouds;

12. and they swirl round about at His direction, that they may do whatever He commands them on the face of the world upon the earth.

13. He causes it to come, whether as a rod, or for His land, or for mercy.

14. Listen to this, O Job; stand still and consider the wondrous works of the Mighty God.

15. Do you know when God appoints them, and causes the lightning of His cloud to shine?

16. Do you know how the clouds are balanced, those wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge?

17. How your garments are warm, when He quiets the earth with the south wind?

18. Have you spread out the clouds with Him, firm as a molten mirror?

19. Teach us what we should say to Him, for we can not set our case in order in the face of darkness.

20. Should He be told that I wish to speak? If a man were to speak, surely he would be swallowed up.

21. Even now men cannot look at the brilliance of the sunlight in the clouds, when the wind has passed and cleared them.

22. Golden splendor comes out of the north; with God is awesome majesty.

23. As for the Almighty, we cannot find Him out; He is great in power, in justice and abundant righteousness; He does not afflict.

24. Therefore men fear Him; He does not regard the wise of heart.

## Job 38

1. Then Jehovah answered Job out of the tempest, and said:

2. Who is this who darkens counsel by words without knowledge?

3. Now gird up your loins like a man; I will consult with you, and you declare unto Me.

4. Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if you have become acquainted with understanding.

5. Who has fixed its measurements? Surely you know! Or who has stretched the line upon it?

6. To what were its foundations fastened? Or who laid its cornerstone,

7. when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?

8. Or who shut in the sea with doors, when it burst forth and came forth from the womb;

9. when I made the clouds its garment, and thick darkness its swaddling band;

10. when I broke My limit for it, and set bars and doors;

11. and said, This far you may come, but no farther, and here your proud waves shall stay!?

12. Have you commanded the morning since your days began, and caused the dawn to know its place,

13. that it might take hold of the ends of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it?

14. It takes on form like clay under a seal, and stands out like a garment.

15. From the wicked their light is withheld, and the lofty arm is broken.

16. Have you entered the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in search of the depths?

17. Have the gates of death been disclosed to you? Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?

18. Have you comprehended the breadth of the earth? Declare, if you know it all!

19. Where is the way to where light dwells? And darkness, where is its place,

20. that you may take it to its territory, that you may observe the paths to its house?

21. You know, because you were born then, and because the number of your days is great.

22. Have you entered the storehouses of snow, or have you seen the storehouses of hail,

23. which I have reserved for the time of distress, for the day of battle and war?

24. By what way is light diffused, or the east wind scattered over the earth?

25. Who has split a channel for the flood, or a path for the thunderbolt,

26. to cause it to rain on a land where there is no man, a wilderness devoid of mankind;

27. to satisfy the desolate waste, and cause to spring forth the growth of vegetation?

28. Has the rain a father? Or who has begotten the drops of dew?

29. From whose womb comes the ice? And the frost of the heavens, who has given it birth?

30. The waters harden like stone, and the surface of the deep is stuck together.

31. Can you bind the bands of the Pleiades, or loosen the cords of Orion?

32. Can you bring out the constellations in their seasons? Or can you guide Ursa Major with its sons?

33. Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you appoint their authority over the earth?

34. Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, that an abundance of water may cover you?

35. Can you send out lightnings, that they may go, and say to you, Here we are!?

36. Who has put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who has given understanding to the mind?

37. Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can lay down the pitchers of the heavens,

38. when the dust is poured into castings, and the clods cling together?

39. Can you hunt the prey for the lion, or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,

40. when they crouch in their dens, or sit in their lairs to lie in wait?

41. Who provides food for the raven, when its young ones cry out to the Mighty God, and wander about for lack of food?

## Job 39

1. Do you know the time when the wild mountain goats bear young? Or can you keep watch for when the deer gives birth?

2. Can you number the months that they fulfill? Or do you know the time when they bring forth,

3. when they crouch, bring forth their young, and deliver their pangs?

4. Their young ones are healthy, they grow up with grain; when they have departed they do not return to them.

5. Who set the wild donkey free? Who loosed the bands of the wild ass,

6. whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwelling?

7. He scorns the tumult of the city; he does not heed the clamor of the driver.

8. The mountain ranges are his pasture, and he searches after every green thing.

9. Will the oryx consent to serve you? Will he pass the night by your feeding trough?

10. Can you bind the oryx in the furrow with ropes? Or will he harrow the valleys after you?

11. Will you trust him because his strength is great? Or will you leave your labor to him?

12. Will you trust him to bring back your grain, and gather it to your threshing floor?

13. Have you made the wings of the ostrich flap joyously, or the wings and feathers of the stork?

14. For she leaves her eggs on the ground, and warms them in the dust;

15. she does not care that a foot may crush them, or that a beast of the field may trample them.

16. She treats her young roughly, as if they were not hers; her labor is in vain without fear,

17. because God has caused her to forget wisdom, and has not imparted understanding to her.

18. When she lifts herself on high, she laughs at the horse and its rider.

19. Have you given the horse its strength? Have you clothed its neck with a mane?

20. Can you make him leap like a locust? His majestic snorting strikes terror.

21. He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength; he goes forth to meet the weapons.

22. He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed; nor does he turn back from the sword.

23. The quiver rattles against him, the glittering spear and javelin.

24. He swallows the ground with rumbling and agitation; nor does he stand still at the sound of the shofar.

25. Every time the shofar sounds he says, Aha! He smells the battle from afar, the thunder of captains and shouting.

26. Does the hawk fly by your wisdom, and spread its wings toward the south?

27. Does the eagle mount up at your mouth, and make its nest on high?

28. It settles down and dwells on the rocks, on the crag of the rock and the stronghold.

29. From there it searches for food; its eyes see great distances.

30. Its young ones suck up blood; and where the slain are, there it is.

## Job 40

1. Moreover Jehovah answered Job, and said:

2. Shall the one who contends with the Almighty find fault? He who reproves God, let him testify.

3. Then Job answered Jehovah and said:

4. Behold, I have been vile! What shall I answer You? I have put my hand to my mouth.

5. Once I have spoken, but I will not answer; yea, twice, but I will proceed no further.

6. Then Jehovah answered Job out of the tempest, and said:

7. Now gird up your loins like a man; I will question you, and you declare unto Me:

8. Would you indeed annul My judgment? Would you condemn Me so that you may be justified?

9. Have you an arm like the Mighty God? Or can you thunder with a voice like His?

10. Adorn yourself with majesty and grandeur, and clothe yourself with glory and honor.

11. Scatter abroad the outburst of your anger; look upon everyone who is proud, and humiliate him.

12. Look upon everyone who is proud, and humble him; tread down the wicked in their place.

13. Hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in darkness.

14. Then I will also confess to you that your own right hand can save you.

15. Behold now, Behemoth, which I made along with you; he eats grass like an ox.

16. See now, his power is in his hips, and his strength is in the muscles of his belly.

17. He moves his tail like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are knit together.

18. His bones are like channels of bronze, his ribs like bars of iron.

19. He is the first of the ways of the Mighty God; only He who made him can bring near His sword.

20. Surely the mountains yield food for him, and all the beasts of the field play there.

21. He lies under the lotus, in the shelter of the reeds and marsh.

22. The lotus trees cover him with their shade; the willows by the brook surround him.

23. If the river becomes violent he is not alarmed; he is confident, though the Jordan bursts forth against his mouth.

24. Can anyone capture him before his eyes, or pierce his nose with snares?

## Job 41

1. Can you draw out Leviathan with a hook, or snare his tongue with a cord which you let down?

2. Can you put a reed rope through his nose, or pierce his jaw with a hook?

3. Will he make many supplications to you? Will he speak gentle words to you?

4. Will he make a covenant with you? Will you capture him as a slave forever?

5. Will you play with him as with a bird, or will you bind him on a leash for your maidens?

6. Will your associates bargain over him? Will they divide him up among the merchants?

7. Can you fill his skin with barbs, or his head with fishing spears?

8. Lay your hand upon him; remember the battle; you will not do it again!

9. Behold, any hope regarding him is false; shall one not be thrown down at the mere sight of him?

10. No one is so fierce that he would dare stir him up. Who then is able to stand before Me?

11. Who has anticipated Me, that I should repay? Everything under the heavens is Mine.

12. I will not keep silent with lies about his mighty utterances, or his graceful proportions.

13. Who has laid bare the face of his apparel? Who can come upon him with a double bridle?

14. Who has opened the doors of his face, with his terrible teeth all around?

15. His rows of shields are his pride, closed up as a tight seal;

16. one is so near another that no air can come between them;

17. they are joined one to another, they stick together and cannot be separated.

18. His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn.

19. Out of his mouth go burning torches; sparks of fire shoot out.

20. Smoke goes out of his nostrils, as from a boiling pot and burning rushes.

21. His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.

22. Strength abides in his neck, and sorrow dances before him.

23. The folds of his flesh are joined together; they are firm on him and cannot be moved.

24. His heart is cast hard as stone, even cast hard as the lower millstone.

25. When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid; because of his crashings they are beside themselves.

26. Though the sword overtakes him, it does not stick; nor does spear, dart, or javelin.

27. He regards iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood.

28. The arrow cannot make him flee; slingstones are turned into stubble by him.

29. Darts are regarded as straw; he laughs at the rattling of javelins.

30. His undersides are like sharp potsherds; he spreads sharp marks in the mire.

31. He makes the deep boil like a pot; he makes the sea like a pot of ointment.

32. He leaves a shining wake behind him; one would think the deep was gray-headed.

33. On earth there is nothing like him, which is made without fear.

34. He beholds every high thing; he is king over all the children of pride.

## Job 42

1. Then Job answered Jehovah and said:

2. I know that You can do everything, and that no purpose is withheld from You.

3. You asked, Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge? So I have proclaimed what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.

4. Grant me this request, and I will speak: I will inquire of You, and You declare to me.

5. I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye has seen You.

6. Therefore I despise myself, and have repented in dust and ashes.

7. And so it was, after Jehovah had spoken these words to Job, that Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath has been kindled against you and your two friends, for you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has.

8. Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, go to My servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and My servant Job will pray for you; for I accept him; lest I deal with you according to your folly; because you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has.

9. So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as Jehovah commanded them; for Jehovah accepted Job.

10. And Jehovah returned what had been taken captive from Job when he prayed for his friends. Indeed Jehovah gave Job twice as much as he had before.

11. Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all those who had been his acquaintances before, came to him and ate food with him in his house; and they consoled him and comforted him for all the evil that Jehovah had brought upon him. Each one gave him a piece of money and each a ring of gold.

12. So Jehovah blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; for he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and one thousand female donkeys.

13. He also had seven sons and three daughters.

14. And he called the name of the first Jemimah, the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-Happuch.

15. In all the land were found no women so beautiful as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.

16. After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his children and grandchildren to four generations.

17. So Job died, old and full of days.
