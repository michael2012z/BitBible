# 2 Chronicles

## 2 Chronicles 1

1. And Solomon the son of David strengthened himself in his kingdom, and Jehovah his God was with him and highly magnified him.

2. And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every leader in all Israel, the heads of the fathers;

3. and Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness, was there.

4. But David had brought up the ark of God from Kirjath Jearim to the place David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.

5. And the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of Jehovah; and Solomon and the assembly sought it out.

6. And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Jehovah, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.

7. That night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, Ask what I shall give you.

8. And Solomon said to God: You have shown great mercy to David my father, and have made me king in his place.

9. Now, O Jehovah God, let Your promise to David my father be established, for You have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth for multitude.

10. Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this great people of Yours?

11. And God said to Solomon: Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches or wealth or honor or the life of your enemies, nor have you asked long life; but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge My people over whom I have made you king;

12. wisdom and knowledge are granted to you; and I will give you riches and wealth and honor, such as none of the kings who were before you have had, nor shall any after you have the like.

13. So Solomon came to Jerusalem from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, and reigned over Israel.

14. And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.

15. Also the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland.

16. And Solomon had horses exported out of Egypt and Mikveh; the kings merchants got them at Mikveh for a price.

17. Now a chariot that came up and was brought out from Egypt was six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse one hundred and fifty; and thus, by their hand, they brought them out to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.

## 2 Chronicles 2

1. And Solomon determined to build a house for the name of Jehovah, and a royal house for himself.

2. Solomon numbered seventy thousand men to bear burdens, eighty thousand to quarry stone in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred to oversee them.

3. And Solomon sent to Huram king of Tyre, saying: As you have dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build himself a house to dwell in,

4. behold, I am building a house for the name of Jehovah my God, to consecrate it to Him, to burn before Him spiced incense, for the continual Bread in Rows, for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Jehovah our God, continually in Israel;

5. and the house which I am building will be great, for our God is greater than all gods;

6. but who is able to build Him a house, since the heavens and the Heaven of heavens cannot contain Him? Who am I then, that I should build Him a house, except to burn sacrifices with smoke before Him?

7. Therefore now, send me a skilled man to work in gold and silver, in bronze and iron, in purple and crimson and violet, who has skill to engrave carvings with the wise men who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father has provided.

8. Also send me cedar, cypress and algum from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon; and behold my servants will be with your servants,

9. to prepare timber for me in abundance, for the house which I am building shall be great and wonderful.

10. And behold, I will give to your servants, the cutters who are cutting timber, twenty thousand kors of ground wheat, twenty thousand kors of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.

11. And Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon: Because of Jehovahs love for His people, He has appointed you king over them.

12. Huram also said: Blessed is Jehovah the God of Israel, who has made the heavens and earth, for He has given King David a wise son, endowed with prudence and understanding, who will build a house for Jehovah and a royal house for himself.

13. And now I have sent a skillful man, having knowledge and understanding, Huram-abi,

14. (the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father, a man of Tyre), knowing how to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, purple and violet, fine linen and crimson, and to make any engraving and to accomplish any plan which may be given to him, with your craftsmen and with the craftsmen of my lord David your father.

15. Now therefore, the wheat, the barley, the oil, and the wine of which my lord has spoken, let him send to his servants.

16. And we will cut timber from Lebanon, as much as you need; we will bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa, and you will carry it up to Jerusalem.

17. And Solomon numbered all the foreign men who were in the land of Israel, after the census in which David his father had numbered them; and there were found to be one hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred.

18. And he made seventy thousand of them bearers of burdens, eighty thousand stonecutters in the mountain, and three thousand six hundred overseers to make the people work.

## 2 Chronicles 3

1. Thus Solomon began to build the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where He had appeared to his father David, at the place that David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

2. And he began to build on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.

3. This is the foundation which Solomon laid for building the house of God: The length was sixty cubits (by cubits according to the former measure) and the width twenty cubits.

4. And the porch that was in front of the sanctuary was twenty cubits long across the width of the house, and the height was one hundred and twenty. He overlaid the inside with pure gold.

5. The great house he paneled with cypress which he covered with fine gold, and he put palm trees and chains on it.

6. And he overlaid the house with precious stones for beauty, and the gold was gold from Parvaim.

7. He also covered the house, the beams and thresholds, its walls and doors, with gold; and he engraved cherubim on the walls.

8. And he made the house of the Holy of Holies. Its length was the same as the front of the house, twenty cubits, and its width twenty cubits. He covered it with six hundred talents of fine gold.

9. The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold; and he covered the upper chambers with gold.

10. In the house of the Holy of Holies he made two cherubim of sculpted work, and overlaid them with gold.

11. The wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits in length: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, touching the wall of the room, and the other wing was five cubits, touching the wing of the other cherub;

12. one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, touching the wall of the room, and the other wing also was five cubits, touching the wing of the other cherub.

13. The wings of these cherubim stretching out twenty cubits; standing on their feet, facing the house.

14. And he made the veil of violet, purple, crimson, and fine linen, with raised cherubim.

15. He also made in front of the house two pillars thirty-five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.

16. He made chains, as in the inner sanctuary, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.

17. And he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand and the other on the left; he called the name of the one on the right hand Jachin, and the name of the one on the left Boaz.

## 2 Chronicles 4

1. Moreover he made a bronze altar: twenty cubits was its length, twenty cubits its width, and ten cubits its height.

2. And he made the cast sea, ten cubits from brim to brim, a round circle. Its height was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits circled around it.

3. And underneath it were shapes like oxen encircling it all around, ten per cubit, all the way around the Sea. The oxen were cast in two rows, when it was cast.

4. It stood on twelve oxen: three looking toward the north, three looking toward the west, three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; the sea was set upon them, with all their back parts inward.

5. It was a handbreadth thick; and its brim was shaped like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It could hold three thousand baths.

6. He also made ten basins, and put five on the right side and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them, and the sea was for the priests to wash in.

7. And he made ten lampstands of gold according to the ordinance, and set them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left.

8. He also made ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. And he made one hundred bowls of gold.

9. Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court and doors for the court; and he overlaid these doors with bronze.

10. He set the sea on the right side, toward the southeast.

11. And Huram made the pots and the shovels and the bowls. And Huram finished doing the work that he was to do for King Solomon for the house of God:

12. the two pillars and the bowls and capitals that were on top of the two pillars; the two networks covering the two bowls of the capitals which were on the tops of the pillars;

13. four hundred pomegranates for the two networks (two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars);

14. he also made the carts and the basins on the carts;

15. one sea and twelve oxen under it;

16. also the pots, the shovels, the forks, and all the utensils Huram-abi made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of Jehovah.

17. In the plain of Jordan the king had them cast, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.

18. And Solomon had all these vessels made in such great abundance that the weight of the bronze was not ascertained.

19. Thus Solomon had all the furnishings made for the house of God: the altar of gold and the tables on which was the Bread of the Presence,

20. the lampstands with their lamps of pure gold, to burn according to the ordinance in front of the inner sanctuary,

21. with the flowers and the lamps and the snuffers of gold, of purest gold;

22. the snuffers, the bowls, the spoons, and the censers of pure gold. And the entrance of the house, its inner doors to the Holy of Holies, and the doors of the house of the temple, were gold.

## 2 Chronicles 5

1. Thus all the work that Solomon had done for the house of Jehovah was finished; and Solomon brought in the things which his father David had consecrated: the silver and the gold and all the articles. And he put them in the treasuries of the house of God.

2. And Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah up from the City of David, which is Zion.

3. And all the men of Israel assembled to the king for the feast, which was in the seventh month.

4. And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark.

5. And they brought up the ark, the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent; the priests, the Levites, brought them up.

6. Also King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled with him before the ark, were sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted or numbered for multitude.

7. And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, to the Holy of Holies, under the wings of the cherubim.

8. For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered over the ark and its poles from above.

9. And the poles were long enough that the ends of the poles of the ark could be seen from in front of the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside. And they are there to this day.

10. Nothing was in the ark except the two tablets which Moses had put there at Horeb, when Jehovah had made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.

11. And it came to pass when the priests came out of the sanctuary (for all the priests who were present had consecrated themselves, without observing their divisions),

12. and the Levites who were singing, all those of Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, were standing to the east of the altar, clothed in white linen, having cymbals, lutes and harps, and with them one hundred and twenty priests sounding the trumpets;

13. and those sounding the trumpets and those singing were as one, with one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Jehovah, to raise their voices with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of song, to praise Jehovah, saying: For He is good, for His mercy is eternal; that the house, the house of Jehovah, was filled with a cloud,

14. so that the priests could not remain standing to serve before the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of God.

## 2 Chronicles 6

1. Then Solomon spoke: Jehovah has said He would dwell in the dark cloud.

2. I have built You an exalted house, and a place for You to dwell always.

3. And the king turned his face and blessed the whole assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel was standing.

4. And he said: Blessed is Jehovah the God of Israel, who has fulfilled with His hands what He has spoken with His mouth to my father David, saying,

5. Since the day that I brought My people out of the land of Egypt, I have chosen no city from any tribe of Israel in which to build a house, that My name might be there, nor have I chosen any man to be a ruler over My people Israel.

6. Yet I have chosen Jerusalem, that My name may be there; and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.

7. Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.

8. But Jehovah said to my father David, Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for My name, you did well in that it was in your heart.

9. Nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who will come from your loins, he shall build the house for My name.

10. Thus Jehovah has fulfilled His word which He has spoken, and I have risen up in place of my father David, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah has spoken; and I have built the house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.

11. And there I have put the ark, in which is the covenant of Jehovah which He has made with the children of Israel.

12. And Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands

13. (for Solomon had made a bronze platform five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and he stood on it, knelt down on his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward Heaven),

14. and he said: O Jehovah, God of Israel, there is no God in the heavens or on earth like You, keeping Your covenant and mercy with Your servants who walk before You with all their hearts.

15. You have kept what You have spoken to Your servant David my father; You have both spoken with Your mouth and fulfilled it with Your hand, as it is this day.

16. Therefore, O Jehovah, God of Israel, now keep what You have spoken to Your servant David my father, saying, You shall not fail to have a man sitting before Me on the throne of Israel, only if your sons take heed to their way, to walk in My Law as you have walked before Me.

17. And now, O Jehovah, God of Israel, let Your Word be established, which You have spoken to Your servant David.

18. But will God indeed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, the heavens and the Heaven of heavens cannot contain You. How much less this house which I have built.

19. Yet have regard to the prayer of Your servant and his supplication, O Jehovah my God, and listen to the cry and the prayer which Your servant is praying before You:

20. that Your eyes may be open toward this house day and night, toward the place where You have spoken to put Your name, that You may hear the prayer which Your servant prays toward this place.

21. And may You hear the supplications of Your servant and of Your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. Hear from Heaven Your dwelling place, and when You have heard, forgive.

22. If anyone sins against his neighbor, and has been required to swear an oath, and has come with an oath before Your altar in this house,

23. then hear from Heaven, and act, and judge Your servants, to bring retribution on the wicked to bring his way upon his own head, and to justify the righteous to give him according to his righteousness.

24. Or if Your people Israel are struck down before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and have returned and confessed Your name, and prayed and made supplication before You in this house,

25. then hear from Heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You have given to them and their fathers.

26. When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You, when they have prayed toward this place and confessed Your name, and turned from their sin because You afflicted them,

27. then hear in Heaven, and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel, that You may teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on Your land which You have given to Your people as an inheritance.

28. When there is famine in the land, pestilence or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers; when their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatever the plague or whatever the sickness;

29. whatever prayer or supplication is made by anyone, or by all Your people Israel, when each one knows his own plague and his own grief, and has spread out his hands to this house:

30. then hear from Heaven Your dwelling place, and forgive, and give to everyone according to all his ways, whose heart You know (for You alone have known the hearts of the sons of men),

31. that they may fear You, to walk in Your ways all the days they live on the face of the land which You have given to our fathers.

32. Moreover, concerning a foreigner, who is not of Your people Israel, but who has come from a distant land because of Your great name and Your mighty hand and Your outstretched arm, when they have come and prayed in this house;

33. then hear from Heaven Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You, that all peoples of the earth may know Your name and fear You, as do Your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by Your name.

34. When Your people go out to battle against their enemies, wherever You send them, and when they have prayed to You toward this city which You have chosen and the house which I have built for Your name,

35. then hear from Heaven their prayer and their supplication, and do what is fitting.

36. When they sin against You (for there is no one who does not sin), and You have become angry with them and delivered them to the enemy, and they have taken them captive to a land far or near;

37. yet when they have returned in their hearts in the land where they have been carried captive, and have turned back, and sought Your favor in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have acted wickedly;

38. and when they have returned to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have been carried captive, and prayed toward their land which You have given to their fathers, the city which You have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for Your name:

39. then hear from Heaven Your dwelling place their prayer and their supplications, and bring about justice, and forgive Your people who have sinned against You.

40. Now, my God, I pray, let Your eyes be open and Your ears attentive to the prayer of this place.

41. Now therefore, Arise, O Jehovah God, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength. Let Your priests, O Jehovah God, be clothed with salvation, and let Your saints rejoice in goodness.

42. O Jehovah God, do not turn away the face of Your anointed; remember the faithfulness of Your servant David.

## 2 Chronicles 7

1. And when Solomon had finished praying, fire came down from the heavens and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of Jehovah filled the house.

2. And the priests were not able to enter the house of Jehovah, because the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of Jehovah.

3. When all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of Jehovah upon the house, they bowed their faces to the ground on the pavement, and prostrated themselves and gave thanks unto Jehovah, saying: For He is good, for His mercy is eternal.

4. And the king and all the people offered sacrifices before Jehovah.

5. King Solomon offered sacrifices of twenty-two thousand bulls and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep. Thus the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.

6. The priests were stationed at their posts; the Levites also with instruments of song unto Jehovah, (which King David had made to give praise unto Jehovah, saying, For His mercy is eternal, whenever David offered praise by their hand), and the priests sounded trumpets opposite them, while all Israel were standing.

7. Furthermore Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house of Jehovah; for there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat.

8. At that time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt.

9. And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, for they observed the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.

10. On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the good that Jehovah had done to David, to Solomon, and to His people Israel.

11. Thus Solomon finished the house of Jehovah and the kings house; and Solomon brought to successful conclusion all that came into his heart to make in the house of Jehovah and in his own house.

12. And Jehovah appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him: I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice.

13. When I shut up the heavens and there is no rain, or command the locusts to devour the land, or send pestilence among My people,

14. if My people who have been called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from the heavens, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.

15. Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to prayers of this place.

16. For now I have chosen and consecrated this house, that My name may be there always; and My eyes and My heart shall be there all the days.

17. As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David has walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and keep My statutes and My judgments,

18. then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, as I have covenanted with David your father, saying, You shall not fail to have a man ruling in Israel.

19. But if you turn back and have forsaken My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed down to them,

20. then I will uproot them from My land which I have given them; and this house which I have consecrated for My name I will cast out from before My face, and will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.

21. And as for this lofty house, everyone who passes by it will be appalled and say, Why has Jehovah done thus to this land and this house?

22. Then they will answer, Because they have forsaken Jehovah the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and taken hold on other gods, and bowed down to them and served them; therefore He has brought all this evil upon them.

## 2 Chronicles 8

1. It came to pass at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the house of Jehovah and his own house,

2. that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them; and he caused the children of Israel to dwell there.

3. And Solomon went to Hamath Zobah and captured it.

4. He also built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities which he built in Hamath.

5. He built upper Beth Horon and lower Beth Horon, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars;

6. also Baalath and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.

7. All the people who were left of the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not of Israel;

8. that is, their sons who were left in the land after them, whom the sons of Israel had not finished off; from these Solomon raised forced labor, as it is to this day.

9. But Solomon did not make slaves for his work from the sons of Israel. They were men of war, commanders of his officers, commanders of his chariots, and his horsemen.

10. And others were chiefs of the deputies of King Solomon: two hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people.

11. And Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh up from the City of David to the house he had built for her; for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David, king of Israel, because the places to which the ark of Jehovah has come are holy.

12. And Solomon offered burnt offerings unto Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah which he had built before the porch,

13. according to the matter of each day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, for the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the three appointed yearly feasts; the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Booths.

14. And, according to the ordinance of David his father, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, the Levites for their charges, to praise and serve before the priests, as the charge of each day required, and the gatekeepers by their divisions at each gate; for thus was the commandment of David the man of God.

15. They did not depart from the command of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasuries.

16. And all the work of Solomon was steadfast from the day of the foundation of the house of Jehovah until it was finished. Thus the house of Jehovah was completed.

17. Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and Elath on the seacoast, in the land of Edom.

18. And Huram sent him ships by the hand of his servants, and servants who knew the sea. They went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and carried away four hundred and fifty talents of gold from there, and brought it to King Solomon.

## 2 Chronicles 9

1. Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test Solomon with difficult questions, having a very great retinue, camels that bore spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was in her heart.

2. And Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from Solomon, that he could not explain it to her.

3. And when the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,

4. the food of his table, the seating of his servants, the service of his waiters and their apparel, his cupbearers and their apparel, and his chamber by which he went up to the house of Jehovah, it took her breath away.

5. And she said to the king: The word was true which I have heard in my own land, about your words and your wisdom.

6. However I did not believe their words until I had come and my eyes saw it; and behold, the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me. You exceed the reports which I have heard.

7. Happy are your men and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom.

8. Blessed is Jehovah your God, who has delighted in you, setting you on His throne to be king for Jehovah your God. In your Gods love for Israel, to establish them forever, He has made you king over them, to do justice and righteousness.

9. And she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, spices in great abundance, and precious stones; there had never been any spices such as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.

10. Also, the servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum wood and precious stones.

11. And the king made terraces of the algum wood for the house of Jehovah and for the kings house, also harps and lutes for the singers; and there had never before been seen such as these in the land of Judah.

12. And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all she desired, whatever she asked, besides what she had brought to the king. So she turned and went to her own land, she and her servants.

13. The weight of gold that came to Solomon each year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,

14. besides what the traveling merchants and traders brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon.

15. And King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of hammered gold went into each shield.

16. He also made three hundred shields of hammered gold; three hundred shekels of gold went into each shield. The king put them in the house of the Forest of Lebanon.

17. Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.

18. The throne had six steps, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne; there were armrests on either side of the place of the seat, with two lions standing beside the armrests.

19. Twelve lions stood there, one on each side of the six steps; nothing like this had been made for any other kingdom.

20. All King Solomons drinking vessels were gold, and all the vessels of the house of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Not one was silver, for it was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon.

21. For the kings ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram. Once every three years the ships came from Tarshish, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.

22. Thus King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.

23. And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.

24. Each man brought his present: articles of silver and gold, garments, weapons, spices, horses, and mules, the matter year by year.

25. Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem.

26. And he reigned over all the kings from the River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt.

27. The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar trees as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland.

28. And they brought horses to Solomon from Egypt and from all lands.

29. Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

30. Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.

31. And Solomon rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.

## 2 Chronicles 10

1. And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.

2. And it happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard it, where he was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon, that Jeroboam returned from Egypt.

3. And they sent for him and called him. And Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,

4. Your father made our yoke heavy; now therefore, lighten the burdensome service of your father and his heavy yoke which he has put on us, and we will serve you.

5. So he said to them, Come back to me after three days. And the people departed.

6. And King Rehoboam consulted the elders who stood before his father Solomon while he still lived, saying, How do you advise me to answer these people?

7. And they spoke to him, saying, If you are kind to the people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be your servants forever.

8. But he rejected the counsel which the elders had given him, and consulted the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.

9. And he said to them, What advice do you give? How should we answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, Lighten the yoke which your father had put on us?

10. And the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus you should speak to the people who have spoken to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter on us; thus you shall say to them: My little finger shall be thicker than my fathers loins!

11. And now, whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions!

12. So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had spoken, saying, Come back to me the third day.

13. And the king answered them harshly. King Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the elders,

14. and he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions!

15. So the king did not consent to the people; for the turn of events was from God, that Jehovah might fulfill His word, which He had spoken by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

16. And when all Israel saw that the king did not consent to them, the people answered the king, saying: What portion have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to your tents, O Israel! Now see to your own house, O David! And all Israel departed to their tents.

17. But Rehoboam reigned over the children of Israel dwelling in the cities of Judah.

18. And King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the labor force; but the sons of Israel stoned him with stones, and he died. So King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste to flee to Jerusalem.

19. Thus Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.

## 2 Chronicles 11

1. Now when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he summoned up from the house of Judah and Benjamin one hundred and eighty thousand choice men who were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might restore the kingdom to Rehoboam.

2. But the Word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,

3. Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,

4. Thus says Jehovah: You shall not go up or fight against your brethren. Let every man return to his house, for this thing has come about from Me. And they obeyed the words of Jehovah, and turned back from going against Jeroboam.

5. So Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.

6. And he built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,

7. Beth Zur, Sochoh, Adullam,

8. Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,

9. Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,

10. Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and Benjamin, fortified cities.

11. And he fortified the strongholds, and put commanders in them, and stores of food, oil, and wine.

12. Also in every city he put shields and spears, and made them very strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.

13. And from all their territories the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel stood with him.

14. For the Levites left their common lands and their possessions and came to Judah and Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them from serving as priests unto Jehovah.

15. And he appointed for himself priests for the high places, for the satyrs, and the calves which he had made.

16. And those from all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek Jehovah the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Jehovah the God of their fathers.

17. So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and spent three years making Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, because they walked in the ways of David and Solomon for three years.

18. And Rehoboam took for himself as wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliah the son of Jesse.

19. And she bore him sons: Jeush, Shamariah, and Zaham.

20. After her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.

21. And Rehoboam loved Maachah the granddaughter of Absalom more than all his wives and his concubines; for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and begot twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.

22. And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maachah as head, as prince among his brothers; to make him king.

23. He dealt with discernment, and dispersed some of his sons throughout all the territories of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city; and he gave them provisions in abundance. He also sought many wives for them.

## 2 Chronicles 12

1. Now it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom and had strengthened himself, that he and all Israel with him forsook the Law of Jehovah.

2. And it happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against Jehovah,

3. with twelve hundred chariots, sixty thousand horsemen, and people without number who came with him out of Egypt; the Lubim and the Sukkiim and the Ethiopians.

4. And he took the fortified cities of Judah and came to Jerusalem.

5. Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the rulers of Judah, who were gathered together in Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, Thus says Jehovah: You have forsaken Me, and therefore I also have forsaken you to the hand of Shishak.

6. So the rulers of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, Jehovah is righteous.

7. And when Jehovah saw that they had humbled themselves, the Word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them a little deliverance. My wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.

8. Nevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may distinguish between My service and the service of the kingdoms of the earth.

9. So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the kings house; he took everything. He also carried away the gold shields which Solomon had made.

10. Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed them to the hands of the commanders of the runners, who guarded the doorway of the kings house.

11. And whenever the king entered the house of Jehovah, the runners went and brought them out; then they returned them to the guardroom.

12. When he humbled himself, the wrath of Jehovah turned back from him, so as not to destroy him completely; and also, conditions were good in Judah.

13. Thus Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Now Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king; and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there. His mothers name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.

14. And he did evil, because he had not fixed his heart to seek Jehovah.

15. Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies. And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.

16. So Rehoboam rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David. And Abijah his son reigned in his place.

## 2 Chronicles 13

1. In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah.

2. He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.

3. Abijah began the battle with an army of mighty men of war, four hundred thousand choice men. Jeroboam also drew up in battle formation against him with eight hundred thousand choice men, mighty men of valor.

4. And Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim in the mountains of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel:

5. Should you not know that Jehovah the God of Israel gave the dominion over Israel to David forever, to him and his sons, by a covenant of salt?

6. Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord.

7. And worthless men gathered to him, and strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted and could not withstand them.

8. And now you think to prevail before the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and you are a great multitude, and with you are the gold calves which Jeroboam made for you as gods.

9. Have you not cast out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made for yourselves priests, like the peoples of other lands, so that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may be a priest of things that are not gods?

10. But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken Him; and the priests who serve Jehovah are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their service.

11. And they burn with smoke unto Jehovah every morning and every evening, the burnt sacrifices and spiced incense; they also set the Bread in Rows in order on the pure gold table, and the lampstand of gold with its lamps to burn every evening; for we are keeping the command of Jehovah our God, but you have forsaken Him.

12. Now behold, God Himself is with us as our head, and His priests with sounding trumpets to sound the alarm against you. O sons of Israel, do not fight against Jehovah the God of your fathers, for you shall not prosper.

13. But Jeroboam caused an ambush to go around behind them; so they were in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them.

14. And when Judah looked around, behold the battle was before and behind them; and they cried out unto Jehovah, and the priests were sounding the trumpets.

15. And the men of Judah gave a shout; and as the men of Judah shouted, it happened that God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.

16. And the sons of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hand.

17. And Abijah and his people struck them with a great slaughter; and five hundred thousand choice men of Israel fell slain.

18. Thus the sons of Israel were subdued at that time; and the sons of Judah prevailed, because they had trusted on Jehovah the God of their fathers.

19. And Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took cities from him: Bethel with its daughter-villages, Jeshanah with its daughter-villages, and Ephron with its daughter-villages.

20. And Jeroboam did not recover strength again in the days of Abijah; and Jehovah struck him, and he died.

21. But Abijah became mighty, married fourteen wives, and begot twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.

22. Now the rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways, and his sayings are written in the midrash of the prophet Iddo.

## 2 Chronicles 14

1. So Abijah rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. And Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days the land was quiet for ten years.

2. Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God,

3. for he removed the foreign altars and the high places, and broke down the sacred pillars and chopped down the groves.

4. He commanded Judah to seek Jehovah the God of their fathers, and to do the Law and the commandment.

5. He also removed the high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah, and the kingdom was quiet before him.

6. And he built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest; he had no war in those years, because Jehovah had given him rest.

7. Therefore he said to Judah, Let us build these cities and make walls around them, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God; we have sought Him, and He has given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.

8. And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand from Judah who carried shields and spears, and from Benjamin two hundred and eighty thousand men who carried shields and drew bows; all these were mighty men of valor.

9. Then Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots, and he came to Mareshah.

10. And Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.

11. And Asa cried out unto Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, it is nothing for You to help, whether with many or with those who have no strength; help us, O Jehovah our God, for we have trusted on You, and in Your name we go against this multitude. O Jehovah, You are our God; do not let man prevail against You.

12. So Jehovah struck the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah, and the Ethiopians fled.

13. And Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar. So the Ethiopians fell, and they could not recover, for they were broken before Jehovah and His army. And they carried away very much spoils.

14. And they struck all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of Jehovah had come upon them; and they plundered all the cities, for there was exceedingly much spoils in them.

15. They also struck the tents of the livestock, and carried off sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.

## 2 Chronicles 15

1. And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded.

2. And he went out before Asa, and said to him: Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin. Jehovah is with you while you are with Him. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will forsake you.

3. For many days Israel has been without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without Law;

4. but when in their trouble they turned to Jehovah the God of Israel, and sought Him, He was found by them.

5. And in those times there was no peace to the one going out, nor to the one coming in, but great turmoil was on all the inhabitants of the lands.

6. And nation has been destroyed by nation, and city by city; for God has vexed them with every distress.

7. But you, be strong and do not let your hands relax, for there is reward for your work.

8. And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and removed the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities which he had taken in the mountains of Ephraim; and he restored the altar of Jehovah that was before the porch of Jehovah.

9. And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those sojourning with them from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon, for they had fallen out to him in great numbers from Israel when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him.

10. And they gathered together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.

11. And they offered to Jehovah at that time seven hundred bulls and seven thousand sheep from the spoils they had brought.

12. And they entered into a covenant to seek Jehovah the God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;

13. and whoever would not seek Jehovah the God of Israel was put to death, whether small or great, man or woman.

14. And they swore unto Jehovah with a loud voice, with shouting and trumpets and shofars.

15. And all Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and sought Him with all their will; and He was found by them, and Jehovah gave them rest all around.

16. He also removed Maachah, the mother of Asa the king, from being queen mother, because she had made a horrible thing for the grove; and Asa cut down her horrible thing, and crushed and burned it by the Brook Kidron.

17. But the high places were not removed from Israel. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.

18. He also brought into the house of God the things that his father had consecrated and that he himself had consecrated: silver and gold and vessels.

19. And there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.

## 2 Chronicles 16

1. In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah and built Ramah, that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.

2. And Asa brought silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of Jehovah and of the kings house, and sent to Ben-Hadad king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying,

3. Let there be a treaty between you and me, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you silver and gold; come, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.

4. So Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa, and sent the commanders of his forces against the cities of Israel; and they struck Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali.

5. And it happened, when Baasha heard it, that he stopped building Ramah and ceased his work.

6. And King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones and timber of Ramah, which Baasha had used for building; and with them he built Geba and Mizpah.

7. At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him: Because you have leaned on the king of Syria, and have not trusted on Jehovah your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your hand.

8. Were the Ethiopians and the Lubim not a huge army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet, because you trusted on Jehovah, He delivered them into your hand.

9. For the eyes of Jehovah run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong for those whose hearts are perfect toward Him. In this you have done foolishly; therefore from now on there will be wars for you.

10. Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the prison house, for he was enraged at him for this; and Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.

11. And so, the acts of Asa, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

12. And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa became diseased in his feet, and his sickness was severe; yet in his sickness he did not seek Jehovah, but the physicians.

13. So Asa rested with his fathers; he died in the forty-first year of his reign.

14. And they buried him in his own tomb, which he had made for himself in the City of David; and they laid him in the bed which was filled with spices and various ingredients prepared in a mixture of ointments; and they made a very great burning for him.

## 2 Chronicles 17

1. Then Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Israel.

2. And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim which Asa his father had taken.

3. And Jehovah was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the former ways of his father David; he did not seek the Baals,

4. but sought the God of his father, and walked in His commandments and not according to the deeds of Israel.

5. Therefore Jehovah established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah gave tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honor in abundance.

6. And his heart was exalted in the ways of Jehovah; moreover he removed the high places and groves out of Judah.

7. Also in the third year of his reign he sent his rulers, Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.

8. And with them he sent Levites: Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.

9. So they taught in Judah, and had the Book of the Law of Jehovah with them; they went throughout all the cities of Judah and taught the people.

10. And the fear of Jehovah was on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat.

11. Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat gifts and tribute of silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred male goats.

12. So Jehoshaphat went on to become highly magnified, and he built fortresses and storage cities in Judah.

13. He had much property in the cities of Judah; and the men of war, mighty men of valor, were in Jerusalem.

14. These are their numbers, according to their fathers houses. Of Judah, the commanders of thousands: Adnah the commander, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valor;

15. and next to him was Jehohanan the commander, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand;

16. and next to him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto Jehovah, and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.

17. Of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand men armed with bow and shield;

18. and next to him was Jehozabad, and with him one hundred and eighty thousand prepared for war.

19. These served the king, besides those the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.

## 2 Chronicles 18

1. Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance; and allied himself with Ahab and became his son-in-law.

2. At the end of some years he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria; and Ahab killed sheep and oxen in abundance for him and the people with him, and enticed him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead.

3. So Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Will you go with me against Ramoth Gilead? And he answered him, I am as you are, and my people as your people; also with you in the war.

4. And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Please inquire for the Word of Jehovah today.

5. So the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain? And they said, Go up, for God will deliver it into the kings hand.

6. But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not still a prophet of Jehovah here, that we may inquire of Him?

7. And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is still one man by whom to inquire of Jehovah; but I hate him, because he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil. He is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.

8. So the king of Israel summoned one of his officers and said, Bring Micaiah the son of Imla quickly.

9. The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, clothed in their robes, were sitting each on his throne; and they were sitting at a threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.

10. Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made horns of iron for himself; and he said, Thus says Jehovah: With these you shall thrust at the Syrians to finish them off.

11. And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper, for Jehovah has delivered it into the kings hand.

12. And the messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king. Therefore please let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak of good things.

13. And Micaiah said, As Jehovah lives, whatever my God says, that I will speak.

14. And he came to the king; and the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain? And he said, Go and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand!

15. And the king said to him, How many times shall I make you swear that you tell me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?

16. Then he said, I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And Jehovah said, These have no master. Let each return to his house in peace.

17. And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell you he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?

18. Then Micaiah said, Therefore hear the Word of Jehovah: I have seen Jehovah sitting on His throne, and all the host of the heavens standing on His right hand and His left.

19. And Jehovah said, Who will persuade Ahab king of Israel to go up, that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead? So one spoke in this manner, and another spoke in that manner.

20. Then a spirit came forward and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will persuade him. Jehovah said to him, In what way?

21. So he said, I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, You shall seduce him and also succeed; go out and do so.

22. Therefore behold, Jehovah has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these prophets of yours, and Jehovah has spoken evil against you.

23. Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way has the spirit from Jehovah gone from me to speak to you?

24. And Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide.

25. And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and return him to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the kings son;

26. and say, Thus says the king: Put this one in prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and water of affliction until I return in peace.

27. And Micaiah said, If indeed you do return in peace, Jehovah has not spoken by me. And he said, Pay attention, all you people!

28. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.

29. And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself and go into battle; but you put on your robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.

30. Now the king of Syria had commanded the commanders of the chariots who were with him, saying, Fight with no one small or great, but only with the king of Israel.

31. So it was, when the commanders of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel! Therefore they surrounded him to engage in battle; but Jehoshaphat cried out, and Jehovah helped him, and God drew them away from him.

32. For so it was, when the commanders of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.

33. Now a certain man drew a bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. So he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn your hand and bring me out of the battle, for I am wounded.

34. The battle increased that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot in view of the Syrians until evening; and about the time of sunset he died.

## 2 Chronicles 19

1. And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned in peace to his house in Jerusalem.

2. And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out before him, and said to King Jehoshaphat, Should you help the wicked and love those hating Jehovah? Therefore wrath is upon you from before Jehovah.

3. Nevertheless good things have been found in you, in that you have burned the groves from the land, and have fixed your heart to seek God.

4. So Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem; and he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to the mountains of Ephraim, and brought them back to Jehovah the God of their fathers.

5. And he appointed judges throughout the land in all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,

6. and said to the judges, Take heed to what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for Jehovah, who is with you in the words of judgment.

7. Now therefore, let the fear of Jehovah be upon you; take heed and do it, for there is no injustice with Jehovah our God, no partiality, nor taking of bribes.

8. Moreover in Jerusalem, for the judgment of Jehovah and for disputes, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the chief fathers of Israel of the Levites and priests, who were brought back to Jerusalem.

9. And he commanded them, saying, You shall do this in the fear of Jehovah, in faithfulness and with a perfect heart:

10. Whatever case comes to you from your brethren who dwell in their cities, whether of bloodshed or offenses against Law or commandment, against statutes or ordinances, you shall warn them, that they not trespass against Jehovah and wrath come upon you and your brethren. Do this, and you shall not be guilty.

11. And behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of Jehovah; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the kings matters; also the Levites will be officials before you. Deal firmly, and Jehovah will be with the good.

## 2 Chronicles 20

1. And it happened after this that the sons of Moab and the sons of Ammon, along with others besides the Ammonites, came to battle against Jehoshaphat.

2. And some came and reported to Jehoshaphat, saying, A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea, from Syria; and they are in Hazazon Tamar (which is En Gedi).

3. And Jehoshaphat feared, and set his face to seek Jehovah, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.

4. So Judah gathered together to seek the face of Jehovah; and from all the cities of Judah they came to seek the face of Jehovah.

5. And Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of Jehovah, before the new court,

6. and said: O Jehovah the God of our fathers, are You not God in Heaven, and do You not rule over all the kingdoms of the nations, and in Your hand is there not power and might, so that no one is able to withstand You?

7. Are You not our God, who drove out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel, and gave it to the seed of Abraham Your friend forever?

8. And they dwell in it, and have built You a sanctuary in it for Your name, saying,

9. If evil comes upon us; sword, judgment, pestilence, or famine; we will stand before this house and before Your face (for Your name is in this house), and cry out to You in our affliction, and You will hear and save.

10. And now, behold, the sons of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, whom You would not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them and have not destroyed them.

11. Behold, they are rewarding us by coming to drive us out of Your possession which You have given us to inherit.

12. O our God, will You not judge them? For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.

13. Now all Judah, with their little ones, their wives, and their children, were standing before Jehovah.

14. Then the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly.

15. And he said, Give attention, all you of Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you, O King Jehoshaphat. Thus says Jehovah to you: Do not be afraid nor dismayed because of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours, but Gods.

16. Tomorrow go down against them. Behold, they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz, and you shall find them at the end of the valley before the wilderness of Jeruel.

17. You shall not fight in this battle. Station yourselves, stand your ground and see the salvation of Jehovah for you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Do not fear or be dismayed; tomorrow go out before them, for Jehovah is with you.

18. And Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Jehovah to prostrate themselves before Jehovah.

19. And the Levites of the sons of the Kohathites and of the sons of the Korahites stood up to praise Jehovah the God of Israel with loud voices on high.

20. So they rose early in the morning and went out into the wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Listen to me, O Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem: Trust in Jehovah your God, and you shall be established; believe His prophets, and you shall prosper.

21. And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who should sing unto Jehovah, and who should praise the glory of holiness, as they went out before the army and were saying: Give thanks unto Jehovah, for His mercy is eternal.

22. And when they began to cry out in songs of praise, Jehovah set ambushes against the sons of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were smitten.

23. For the sons of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to utterly kill and destroy them. And when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, they helped to destroy one another.

24. So when Judah had come to the lookout point at the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude; and behold, the corpses, fallen to the earth. No one had escaped.

25. And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to plunder the spoils, they found among them an abundance of property on the corpses, with precious jewelry, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away; and they were three days plundering the spoils because there was so much.

26. And on the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berachah, for there they blessed Jehovah; therefore the name of that place was called The Valley of Berachah to this day.

27. Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat at the head of them, to go back to Jerusalem with joy; for Jehovah had made them rejoice over their enemies.

28. So they came to Jerusalem, with lutes and harps and trumpets, to the house of Jehovah.

29. And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that Jehovah had fought against the enemies of Israel.

30. So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest all around.

31. So Jehoshaphat was king over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.

32. And he walked in the way of his father Asa, and did not turn aside from it, to do what was right in the eyes of Jehovah.

33. Nevertheless the high places were not taken away, for as yet the people had not fixed their hearts to the God of their fathers.

34. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is brought up in the book of the kings of Israel.

35. After this Jehoshaphat king of Judah had made an alliance with Ahaziah king of Israel, who acted very wickedly.

36. And he allied himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they made the ships in Ezion Geber.

37. But Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah, Jehovah has broken your works. And the ships were wrecked, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish.

## 2 Chronicles 21

1. And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his place.

2. He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.

3. Their father gave them many gifts of silver and gold and precious things, with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn.

4. Now when Jehoram rose to power over the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself and killed all his brothers with the sword, and also others of the rulers of Israel.

5. Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

6. And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for he had the daughter of Ahab as a wife; and he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah.

7. Yet Jehovah would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that He had made with David, and since He had promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons forever.

8. In his days the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.

9. So Jehoram went out with his commanders, and all his chariots with him. And he rose up by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him and the commanders of the chariots.

10. Thus Edom has been in revolt from under the hand of Judah to this day. At that time Libnah revolted from under his hand, because he had forsaken Jehovah the God of his fathers.

11. Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit harlotry, and thrust Judah aside.

12. And a writing came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus says Jehovah the God of your father David: Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, or in the ways of Asa king of Judah,

13. but have walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot like the harlotry of the house of Ahab, and also have killed your brothers, those of your fathers household, who were better than yourself,

14. behold, Jehovah is striking your people with a great blow; your children, your wives, and all your possessions;

15. and you shall have great sickness with a disease of your intestines, until your intestines come out by reason of the sickness, day by day.

16. Moreover Jehovah stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and the Arabians who were near the Ethiopians.

17. And they came up into Judah and broke through, and carried away all the possessions that were found in the kings house, and also his sons and his wives, so that there was not a son left to him except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.

18. And after all this Jehovah struck him in his intestines with an incurable disease.

19. And it happened in the course of time, after the end of two years, that his intestines came out because of his sickness; so he died from the miserable disease. And his people made no burning for him, like the burnings for his fathers.

20. He was thirty-two years old when he became king. He reigned in Jerusalem eight years and, and departed unloved. And they buried him in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.

## 2 Chronicles 22

1. Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place, for the raiders who came with the Arabians into the camp had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, reigned.

2. Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.

3. He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was counseling him to do wickedly.

4. Therefore he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, like the house of Ahab; for they were his counselors after the death of his father, to his destruction.

5. He also followed their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead; and the Syrians struck Joram.

6. And he returned to Jezreel to heal from the wounds with which he was struck at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.

7. Now Ahaziahs destruction, when he went to Joram, was from God; for when he came, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.

8. And it happened, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziahs brothers who served Ahaziah, that he killed them.

9. He also sought for Ahaziah; and they caught him (he was hiding in Samaria), and brought him to Jehu. When they had killed him, they buried him, because, they said, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Jehovah with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no one to retain power over the kingdom.

10. Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and commanded to destroy all the royal seed of the house of Judah.

11. But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the kings sons who were being killed, and put him and his nurse in a bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah so that she did not kill him.

12. And he was hiding with them in the house of God for six years, while Athaliah reigned over the land.

## 2 Chronicles 23

1. In the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and made a covenant with the commanders of hundreds: Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri.

2. And they went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the chief fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.

3. And all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, Behold, the kings son shall reign, as Jehovah has spoken of the sons of David.

4. This is what you shall do: One-third of you entering on the Sabbath, of the priests and the Levites, shall be gatekeepers of the doors;

5. one-third shall be at the kings house; and one-third at the gate of the foundation. All the people shall be in the courts of the house of Jehovah.

6. But let no one come into the house of Jehovah except the priests and those of the Levites who serve. They may go in, for they are holy; but all the people shall keep the watch of Jehovah.

7. And the Levites shall surround the king on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes into the house, let him be put to death. You are to be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.

8. So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And each man took his men who were to come in on the Sabbath, with those who were going out on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest had not dismissed the divisions.

9. And Jehoiada the priest gave to the commanders of hundreds the spears and the large and small shields which had belonged to King David, that were in the house of God.

10. And he stationed all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and by the house, all around the king.

11. And they brought out the kings son, put the crown on him, gave him the Testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, Long live the king!

12. Now when Athaliah heard the sound of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of Jehovah.

13. When she looked, behold, the king was standing by his pillar at the entrance; and the rulers and the trumpeters were by the king. All the people of the land were joyful, blowing trumpets, and singing with instruments of song, and leading in praise. So Athaliah tore her clothes and said, Treason! Treason!

14. And Jehoiada the priest brought out the commanders of hundreds who mustered the forces, and said to them, Bring her out of the area of the house, and slay with the sword whoever follows her. For the priest had said, Do not kill her in the house of Jehovah.

15. So they laid hands on her, and she came by way of the entrance of the Horse Gate by the kings house, and they killed her there.

16. And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, the people, and the king, to be the people of Jehovah.

17. And all the people went to the house of Baal, and tore it down. They broke in pieces its altars and images, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.

18. Jehoiada also appointed the oversight of the house of Jehovah into the hand of the priests, the Levites, whom David had assigned to the house of Jehovah, to offer the burnt offerings of Jehovah, as it is written in the Law of Moses, with gladness and song, by the hands of David.

19. And he stationed the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of Jehovah, so that no one who was in any way unclean could enter.

20. And he took the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the house of Jehovah; and they came through the Upper Gate to the kings house, and made the king sit on the throne of the kingdom.

21. So all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet, for they had slain Athaliah with the sword.

## 2 Chronicles 24

1. Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.

2. Joash did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest.

3. And Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he begot sons and daughters.

4. Now it happened after this that Joash set his heart to repair the house of Jehovah.

5. And he gathered the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that you do it quickly. However the Levites did not do it quickly.

6. So the king called Jehoiada the chief priest, and said to him, Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and from Jerusalem the offering of Moses the servant of Jehovah and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent of witness?

7. For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken into the house of God, and had also offered all the consecrated things of the house of Jehovah to the Baals.

8. So at the kings command they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of the house of Jehovah.

9. And they made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring to Jehovah the offering that Moses the servant of God had laid upon Israel in the wilderness.

10. And all the rulers and all the people rejoiced, brought and threw into the chest until they were all finished.

11. So it was, at that time, when the chest was brought to the kings official by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, that the kings scribe and the high priests officer came and emptied the chest, and took it and returned it to its place. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.

12. And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of Jehovah; and they hired masons and craftsmen to repair the house of Jehovah, and also craftsmen in iron and bronze to restore the house of Jehovah.

13. So the workmen labored, and the work of restoration excelled in their hands; they built up the house of God to its proper measure and strengthened it.

14. When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada; they made from it vessels for the house of Jehovah, utensils for serving and offering, spoons and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of Jehovah continually all the days of Jehoiada.

15. And Jehoiada grew old and satisfied with days, and died; he was one hundred and thirty years old at his death.

16. And they buried him in the City of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God and His house.

17. And after the death of Jehoiada the rulers of Judah came and bowed down to the king. And the king gave heed to them.

18. And they forsook the house of Jehovah the God of their fathers, and served the groves and idols; and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem because of their trespass.

19. And He sent prophets to them, to bring them back to Jehovah; and they testified against them, but they would not listen.

20. And the Spirit of God clothed Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, who stood above the people, and said to them, Thus says God: Why do you transgress the commandments of Jehovah, so that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken Jehovah, He also has forsaken you.

21. So they conspired against him, and at the command of the king they stoned him with stones in the court of the house of Jehovah.

22. Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but killed his son; and as he died, he said, May Jehovah take notice, and require it!

23. So it happened at the turning of the year that the army of Syria came up against him; and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the rulers of the people from among the people, and sent all their spoils to the king of Damascus.

24. For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; but Jehovah delivered a very great army into their hand, because they had forsaken Jehovah the God of their fathers. Thus they executed judgment against Joash.

25. And when they had withdrawn from him (for they left him severely wounded), his own servants conspired against him because of the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed. So he died. And they buried him in the City of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings.

26. These are the ones who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.

27. Now concerning his sons, and the great many tributes to him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the midrash of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his place.

## 2 Chronicles 25

1. Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.

2. And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, but not with a perfect heart.

3. Now it happened, when the kingdom had been secured to him, that he executed his servants who had killed his father the king.

4. However he did not execute their children, but did as it is written in the Law in the Book of Moses, where Jehovah had commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor shall the sons be put to death for their fathers; but each shall die for his own sin.

5. Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, according to their fathers houses, throughout all Judah and Benjamin; and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them to be three hundred thousand choice men, able to go to war, handling spear and shield.

6. He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valor from Israel for one hundred talents of silver.

7. But a man of God came to him, saying, O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for Jehovah is not with Israel; with any of the sons of Ephraim.

8. But if you do go, do it. Be strong in battle. But even so, God shall make you stumble before the enemy; for God has power to help and to overthrow.

9. And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do about the hundred talents which I have given to the troops of Israel? And the man of God answered, Jehovah has much more than this to give you.

10. So Amaziah dismissed the troops that had come to him from Ephraim, to go back to their place. Therefore their anger burned greatly against Judah, and they returned to their place in burning anger.

11. And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led his people and went to the Valley of Salt and killed ten thousand of the sons of Seir.

12. And the sons of Judah took captive ten thousand alive, brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were ripped to pieces.

13. But as for the troops which Amaziah had dismissed, so that they should not go with him to battle, they raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon, killed three thousand in them, and plundered much spoils.

14. And it came about, after Amaziah came from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, set them up to be his gods, and bowed down before them and burned incense to them.

15. Therefore the anger of Jehovah burned against Amaziah, and He sent him a prophet who said to him, Why have you sought the gods of the people, which could not rescue their own people from your hand?

16. So it was, as he spoke with him, that the king said to him, Have we made you the kings counselor? Stop! Why should you be killed? So the prophet stopped, and said, I know that God has given counsel to destroy you, because you have done this and have not heeded my counsel.

17. Now Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look each other in the face.

18. And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son as wife; and a wild beast that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle.

19. Behold, you say that you have struck the Edomites, and your heart is lifted up to boast. Stay at home now; why should you excite yourself to evil, that you should fall; you and Judah with you?

20. But Amaziah would not listen, for it was from God, to deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they had resorted to the gods of Edom.

21. So Joash king of Israel went out; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.

22. And Judah was struck down before Israel, and every man fled to his tent.

23. And Joash the king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth Shemesh; and he brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate; four hundred cubits.

24. And he took all the gold and silver, all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, the treasures of the kings house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.

25. And Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.

26. Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from first to last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

27. After the time that Amaziah turned away from following Jehovah, they conspired treason against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there.

28. And they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.

## 2 Chronicles 26

1. And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.

2. He built Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king rested with his fathers.

3. Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.

4. And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.

5. He sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God; and in the days that he sought Jehovah, God made him prosper.

6. And he went out and made war against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities around Ashdod and among the Philistines.

7. God helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabians who lived in Gur-Baal, and against the Meunim.

8. The Ammonites also brought tribute to Uzziah. His fame spread as far as the entrance of Egypt, for he became exceedingly strong.

9. And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the corner of the wall, and fortified them.

10. He also built towers in the wilderness, and dug many wells, for he had much livestock, both in the lowlands and in the plains; he also had farmers and vinedressers in the mountains and in Carmel, for he loved the soil.

11. Moreover Uzziah had forces making war who went out to war by divisions, according to the number of their muster by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the kings commanders.

12. The total number of heads of fathers of the mighty men of valor was two thousand six hundred.

13. And under their hand was a military force of three hundred and seven thousand five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.

14. And Uzziah provided for them, for the entire army, shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows, and stones for the slings.

15. And he made devices in Jerusalem, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and the corners, to shoot arrows and large stones. And his fame spread far and wide, for he was marvelously helped till he became strong.

16. But when he was strong his heart was lifted up, to his destruction, for he transgressed against Jehovah his God to enter the temple of Jehovah to burn incense on the altar of incense.

17. And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him were eighty priests of Jehovah; valiant men.

18. And they withstood King Uzziah, and said to him, It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense unto Jehovah, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Get out of the sanctuary, for you have trespassed! You shall have no honor from Jehovah God.

19. And Uzziah became enraged; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense. And while he was angry with the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead, before the priests in the house of Jehovah, beside the incense altar.

20. And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked towards him, and behold, on his forehead he was leprous; so they hurried him out of that place. Indeed he also hurried to get out, because Jehovah had struck him.

21. And King Uzziah was a leper until the day of his death. He dwelt in a separate house, because he was a leper; for he was cut off from the house of Jehovah. And Jotham his son was over the kings house, judging the people of the land.

22. Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from first to last, the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz has written.

23. So Uzziah rested with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings, for they said, He is a leper. And Jotham his son reigned in his place.

## 2 Chronicles 27

1. Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok.

2. And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Uzziah had done (although he did not enter the temple of Jehovah). But the people continued to do corruptly.

3. He built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah, and he built extensively on the wall of Ophel.

4. Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers.

5. He also fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed over them. And the children of Ammon gave him in that year one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand kors of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. The children of Ammon paid this to him in the second and third years also.

6. Thus Jotham became mighty, because he had directed his ways before Jehovah his God.

7. Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, behold they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

8. He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.

9. So Jotham rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. And Ahaz his son reigned in his place.

## 2 Chronicles 28

1. Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not do what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, like his father David.

2. For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made molten images for the Baals.

3. He burned incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burned his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah had cast out before the children of Israel.

4. And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.

5. Therefore Jehovah his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria. They struck him, and carried away a great multitude of them as captives, and brought them to Damascus. Then he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who struck him down with a great slaughter.

6. For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed one hundred and twenty thousand in Judah in one day, all valiant men, because they had forsaken Jehovah the God of their fathers.

7. Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the kings son, Azrikam the officer over the house, and Elkanah who was second to the king.

8. And the sons of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand women, sons, and daughters; and they also took away much spoils from them, and brought the spoils to Samaria.

9. But a prophet of Jehovah was there, whose name was Oded; and he went out before the army that came to Samaria, and said to them: Behold, because Jehovah the God of your fathers was angry with Judah, He has delivered them into your hand; but you have killed them in a rage that reaches up to the heavens.

10. And now you propose to subject the children of Judah and Jerusalem to be your male and female slaves; but do you not also have guilt of your own before Jehovah your God?

11. Now listen to me, therefore, and return the captives, whom you have taken captive from your brethren, for the fierce wrath of Jehovah is upon you.

12. Then some of the heads of the sons of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war,

13. and said to them, You shall not bring the captives here, for we are already guilty before Jehovah. You intend to add to our sins and to our guilt; for our guilt is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.

14. So the armed men left the captives and the spoils before the rulers and all the assembly.

15. Then the men who were designated by name rose up and took the captives, and from the spoils they clothed all who were naked among them, dressed them and gave them sandals, gave them food and drink, and anointed them; and they let all the feeble ones ride on donkeys. So they brought them to their brethren at Jericho, the city of palm trees; and returned to Samaria.

16. At that time King Ahaz had sent to the king of Assyria to help him,

17. for again the Edomites had come, struck Judah, and carried away captives.

18. The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland and of the south of Judah, and had taken Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Sochoh with its daughter-villages, Timnah with its daughter-villages, and Gimzo with its daughter-villages; and dwelt there.

19. For Jehovah had humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had led Judah into lack of restraints, and to trespass in unfaithfulness unto Jehovah.

20. And Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came to him and distressed him, and did not help him.

21. For Ahaz took part of the treasures from the house of Jehovah, from the house of the king, and from the rulers, and he gave it to the king of Assyria; but he did not help him.

22. And in the time of his distress he became increasingly unfaithful to Jehovah; this King Ahaz.

23. For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had struck him, saying, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel.

24. So Ahaz gathered the vessels of the house of God, cut in pieces the utensils of the house of God, shut up the doors of the house of Jehovah, and made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem.

25. And in every single city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger Jehovah the God of his fathers.

26. Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, behold they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

27. So Ahaz rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem; but they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.

## 2 Chronicles 29

1. Hezekiah became king when he was twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah.

2. And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father David had done.

3. In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of Jehovah and repaired them.

4. And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together in the east plaza,

5. and said to them: Hear me, you Levites. Now consecrate yourselves, consecrate the house of Jehovah the God of your fathers, and carry out the filth from the holy place.

6. For our fathers have been unfaithful and done evil in the eyes of Jehovah our God; they have forsaken Him, have turned their faces away from the dwelling place of Jehovah, and turned their backs on Him.

7. They have also shut up the doors of the porch, put out the lamps, and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel.

8. Therefore the wrath of Jehovah is upon Judah and Jerusalem, and He has given them up to trembling and terror, to horror, and to hissing, as you see with your eyes.

9. For behold, because of this our fathers have fallen by the sword; and our sons, our daughters, and our wives are in captivity.

10. Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Jehovah the God of Israel, that His fierce wrath may turn away from us.

11. Now my sons, do not be negligent, for Jehovah has chosen you to stand before Him, to serve Him, and that you should serve Him and burn incense.

12. Then these Levites rose up: Mahath the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah;

13. of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;

14. of the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.

15. And they gathered their brethren, consecrated themselves, and went according to the commandment of the king, by the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah.

16. And the priests went into the inner part of the house of Jehovah to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah, to the court of the house of Jehovah. And the Levites took it out and carried it to the Brook Kidron.

17. And they began to consecrate on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the porch of Jehovah. Then they consecrated the house of Jehovah in eight days, and by the sixteenth day of the first month they had finished.

18. And they went in to King Hezekiah and said, We have cleansed all the house of Jehovah, the altar of burnt offerings with all its utensils, and the table of the Bread in Rows with all its utensils.

19. Moreover all the articles which King Ahaz in his reign had cast aside in his unfaithfulness we have prepared and consecrated; and behold, they are before the altar of Jehovah.

20. Then King Hezekiah arose early, gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of Jehovah.

21. And they brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests, the sons of Aaron, to offer them on the altar of Jehovah.

22. So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. Likewise they killed the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar. They also killed the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar.

23. Then they brought out the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them.

24. And the priests killed them; and they offered their blood on the altar as a sin offering to make atonement for all Israel; for the king had commanded the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.

25. And he stationed the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with lutes, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, of Gad the kings seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for thus was the commandment of Jehovah by the hand of his prophets.

26. The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.

27. And Hezekiah commanded them to offer the burnt offering on the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of Jehovah also began, with the trumpets and by the hand of the instruments of David, king of Israel.

28. So all the assembly bowed down, the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this until the burnt offering was finished.

29. And when they had finished offering, the king and all who were present with him bowed down and prostrated themselves.

30. Moreover King Hezekiah and the rulers commanded the Levites to praise Jehovah with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they praised with gladness, and they bowed down and prostrated themselves.

31. Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now that you have confirmed your hands unto Jehovah, come near, and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of Jehovah. And the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings, and as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings.

32. And the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these for a burnt offering unto Jehovah.

33. The consecrated things were six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep.

34. But the priests were too few, so that they were not able to flay all the burnt offerings; therefore their brethren the Levites supported them until the work was ended and until the other priests had consecrated themselves, for the Levites were more upright in heart to consecrate themselves than the priests.

35. Also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings and with the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. Thus the service of the house of Jehovah was set in order.

36. And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced that God had prepared the people, since the thing came about suddenly.

## 2 Chronicles 30

1. And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover unto Jehovah the God of Israel.

2. For the king and his rulers and all the assembly in Jerusalem had taken counsel to keep the Passover in the second month.

3. For they could not keep it at the regular time, because a sufficient number of priests had not consecrated themselves, nor had the people gathered together at Jerusalem.

4. And the matter was right in the eyes of the king and all the assembly.

5. So they established a decree throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover unto Jehovah the God of Israel at Jerusalem, for they had not done it for many days as it is written.

6. And the runners went throughout all Israel and Judah with the letters from the king and his rulers, and spoke according to the command of the king: O Children of Israel, return unto Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel; then He will return to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.

7. And do not be like your fathers and your brethren, who have been unfaithful to Jehovah the God of their fathers, so that He gave them up to desolation, as you see.

8. Now do not stiffen your necks, like your fathers, but give your hands unto Jehovah; and enter His sanctuary, which He has consecrated for all time, and serve Jehovah your God, that the fierceness of His wrath may turn away from you.

9. For if you return to Jehovah, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before those holding them captive, to come back to this land; for Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn His face from you if you return to Him.

10. So the runners passed from city to city through the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun; but they laughed at them, mocking them.

11. Nevertheless some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.

12. Also the hand of God was on Judah to give them singleness of heart to obey the command of the king and the rulers, at the Word of Jehovah.

13. And many people, a very great assembly, gathered at Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month.

14. They arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and they took away all the incense altars and cast them into the Brook Kidron.

15. Then they slaughtered the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed, and consecrated themselves, and brought the burnt offerings to the house of Jehovah.

16. They stood in their place according to the ordinance, according to the Law of Moses the man of God; the priests were sprinkling the blood from the hand of the Levites.

17. For many in the assembly had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites had charge of the slaughter of the Passover for everyone who was not clean, to consecrate them to Jehovah.

18. For a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, O good Jehovah, provide atonement for everyone

19. who has prepared his heart to seek God, Jehovah the God of his fathers, though not according to the purification of the sanctuary.

20. And Jehovah gave heed to Hezekiah and healed the people.

21. So the children of Israel found at Jerusalem kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great joy; and the Levites and the priests were praising Jehovah day by day, with loud instruments unto Jehovah.

22. And Hezekiah spoke to the heart of all the Levites who were teaching the good understanding of Jehovah; and they ate throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings and making confession unto Jehovah the God of their fathers.

23. And the whole assembly took counsel to keep the feast another seven days, and they kept it another seven days with joy.

24. For Hezekiah king of Judah had given to the assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep, and the rulers had given to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep; and a great number of priests consecrated themselves.

25. The whole assembly of Judah rejoiced, along with the priests and Levites, all the assembly that came from Israel, the sojourners who came from the land of Israel, and those dwelling in Judah.

26. So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the days of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem.

27. Then the priests, the Levites, rose up and blessed the people, and their voice was heard; and their prayer came up to His holy dwelling place, to the heavens.

## 2 Chronicles 31

1. Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah and broke the sacred pillars in pieces, chopped down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars; from all Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh; until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned to their own cities, each to his possession.

2. And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites according to their divisions, each man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and peace offerings, to serve, to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of Jehovah.

3. The king also appointed a portion of his possessions for the burnt offerings: for the morning and evening burnt offerings, the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths and the new moons and the set feasts, as it is written in the Law of Jehovah.

4. Moreover he commanded the people who dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion for the priests and the Levites, that they might grow strong in the Law of Jehovah.

5. As soon as the word spread, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of grain and wine, oil and honey, and of all the produce of the field; and they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything.

6. And the children of Israel and Judah, who dwelt in the cities of Judah, brought the tithe of oxen and sheep; also the tithe of holy things which were consecrated to Jehovah their God they laid in heaps upon heaps.

7. In the third month they began laying them in heaps, and they finished in the seventh month.

8. And when Hezekiah and the rulers came and saw the heaps, they blessed Jehovah and His people Israel.

9. And Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.

10. And Azariah the chief priest, from the house of Zadok, answered him and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of Jehovah, we have had enough to eat and have plenty left, for Jehovah has blessed His people; and what is left is this great abundance.

11. And Hezekiah commanded them to prepare rooms in the house of Jehovah, and they prepared them.

12. And they faithfully brought in the offerings, the tithes, and the consecrated things; Cononiah the Levite had charge of them, and Shimei his brother was next.

13. Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the appointment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.

14. Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the east gate, was over the freewill offerings to God, to distribute the offerings of Jehovah and the set apart, holy things.

15. And under him were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, trusted in the cities of the priests, to distribute to the divisions by the hand of their brethren, to the great as well as the small.

16. Besides those males from three years old and up who were reckoned by genealogy, they distributed to everyone who entered the house of Jehovah his portion day by day for the service of his charge, according to his division,

17. and to the priests who were reckoned by genealogy according to their fathers house, and to the Levites from twenty years old and up according to their charge, by their divisions,

18. and to all who were reckoned by genealogy; their little ones and their wives, their sons and daughters, the whole company of them; for in their faithfulness they sanctified themselves in holiness.

19. Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the common lands of their cities, in each city, there were men who were designated by name to distribute portions to all the males among the priests and to all who were reckoned by genealogy among the Levites.

20. Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah, and he did what was good and right and true before Jehovah his God.

21. And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, in the Law and in the commandment, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.

## 2 Chronicles 32

1. After these deeds of faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and entered Judah; he encamped against the fortified cities, thinking to break through for himself.

2. And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that his purpose was to make war against Jerusalem,

3. he took counsel with his rulers and mighty men to stop the water from the springs which were outside the city; and they helped him.

4. So, many people gathered together who stopped all the springs and the brook that ran through the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water?

5. And he strengthened himself, built up all the wall that was broken, raised it up to the towers, and built another wall outside; he also restored the Millo in the City of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance.

6. And he assigned commanders of war over the people, gathered them together to him in the open place of the city gate, and spoke to their heart, saying,

7. Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid nor dismayed before the king of Assyria, nor before all the multitude that is with him; for there are more with us than with him.

8. With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is Jehovah our God, to help us and to fight our battles. And the people were bolstered by the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.

9. After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem (but he and all the forces with him laid siege against Lachish), to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah who were in Jerusalem, saying,

10. Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria: In what are you trusting, that you remain under siege in Jerusalem?

11. Is not Hezekiah enticing you to give yourselves over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria?

12. Has not the same Hezekiah taken away His high places and His altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, You shall bow down before one altar and burn incense on it?

13. Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of other lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands in any way able to deliver their lands out of my hand?

14. Who among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed was able to deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?

15. Now therefore, do not let Hezekiah deceive you nor entice you like this, and do not believe him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand or the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand.

16. Furthermore, his servants spoke against Jehovah God and against His servant Hezekiah.

17. He had also written letters to reproach Jehovah the God of Israel, and to speak against Him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver His people from my hand.

18. Then they called out with a loud voice in the Jewish language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them and terrify them, that they might capture the city.

19. And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the peoples of the lands; the work of mens hands.

20. Now because of this King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, prayed and cried out to the heavens.

21. And Jehovah sent an angel who cut down every mighty man of valor, rulers, and commanders in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned shamefaced to his own land. And when he went into the house of his god, he fell by the sword of some of the offspring of his own body.

22. Thus Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.

23. And many brought gifts unto Jehovah at Jerusalem, and choice things to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the eyes of all the nations thereafter.

24. In those days Hezekiah was sick unto death, and he prayed to Jehovah; and He spoke to him and gave him a sign.

25. But Hezekiah did not return according to the favor shown him, for his heart had become haughty; therefore wrath was over him and over Judah and Jerusalem.

26. Then Hezekiah humbled himself for the haughtiness of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Jehovah did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.

27. Hezekiah had very great riches and honor. And he made himself treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of desirable objects;

28. storehouses for the harvest of grain, wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of livestock, and folds for flocks.

29. Moreover he provided cities for himself, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very much property.

30. This same Hezekiah also stopped the water outlet of upper Gihon, and brought the water by tunnel to the west side of the City of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his pursuits.

31. However, regarding the ambassadors of the rulers of Babylon, who were sent to him to inquire about the wonder that had happened in the land, God left him alone, to test him, to know all his heart.

32. Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

33. So Hezekiah rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper tombs of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his place.

## 2 Chronicles 33

1. Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.

2. And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, according to the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah had cast out before the children of Israel.

3. For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; he raised up altars for the Baals, and made groves; and he bowed down to all the host of the heavens and served them.

4. He also built altars in the house of Jehovah, of which Jehovah had said, In Jerusalem shall My name be always.

5. And he built altars for all the host of the heavens in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.

6. He also caused his sons to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; he practiced fortunetelling, witchcraft and sorcery, and consulted mediums and necromancers. He did much evil in the eyes of Jehovah, to provoke Him to anger.

7. And he set a graven image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name always;

8. and I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for your fathers; only if they take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole Law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.

9. So Manasseh caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go astray, to do more evil than the nations whom Jehovah had destroyed before the children of Israel.

10. And Jehovah spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they would not listen.

11. Therefore Jehovah brought upon them the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh with hooks, bound him with bronze fetters, and carried him off to Babylon.

12. And when he was in distress, he entreated Jehovah his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,

13. and prayed to Him; and He was entreated of him, heard his supplication, and brought him back to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh recognized that Jehovah was God.

14. After this he built a wall outside the City of David on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate; and it encircled Ophel, and he raised it to a very great height. And he stationed commanders of the forces in all the fortified cities of Judah.

15. He took away the foreign gods and the idol out of the house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of Jehovah and in Jerusalem; and he cast them out of the city.

16. He also repaired the altar of Jehovah, sacrificed peace offerings and thank offerings on it, and commanded Judah to serve Jehovah the God of Israel.

17. However the people still sacrificed on the high places; nevertheless to Jehovah their God.

18. Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of Jehovah the God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.

19. Also his prayer and his entreaty, and all his sin and unfaithfulness, and the places where he built high places and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled, behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers.

20. So Manasseh rested with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. And his son Amon reigned in his place.

21. Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.

22. And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, as his father Manasseh had done; for Amon sacrificed to all the graven images which his father Manasseh had made, and served them.

23. And he did not humble himself before Jehovah, as his father Manasseh had humbled himself, but Amon exceeded his guilt.

24. Then his servants conspired against him, and killed him in his own house.

25. But the people of the land executed all those who had conspired against King Amon. And the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.

## 2 Chronicles 34

1. Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.

2. And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of his father David; he did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.

3. For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began to seek the God of his father David; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the groves, the graven images, and the molten images.

4. They broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence, and the incense altars which were above them he cut down; and the groves, the graven images, and the molten images he broke in pieces, and pulverized them and scattered them on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.

5. He also burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem;

6. and also in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, as far as Naphtali and all around; with chopping tools.

7. When he had broken down the altars and the groves, had beaten the carved images into powder, and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.

8. In the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Jehovah his God.

9. And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites who kept the doors had gathered from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, from all the remnant of Israel, from all Judah and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

10. And they gave it into the hand of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and they gave it to the workmen who worked in the house of Jehovah, to repair and restore the house.

11. They gave it to the craftsmen and builders to buy hewn stone and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.

12. And the men did the work faithfully. Their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah the Levites, of the sons of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to supervise. Others of the Levites were teaching the instruments of song,

13. were over the burden bearers, and were overseers of all who did work in any kind of service. And some of the Levites were scribes, officers, and gatekeepers.

14. Now when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of Jehovah given by the hand of Moses.

15. And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the Book of the Law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah gave the Book to Shaphan.

16. So Shaphan carried the Book to the king, bringing the king word, saying, All that was committed to your servants they are doing.

17. And they have gathered the money that was found in the house of Jehovah, and have given it into the hand of the overseers and the workmen.

18. Then Shaphan the scribe reported to the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has given me a Book. And Shaphan read it before the king.

19. And it came about, when the king heard the Words of the Law, that he tore his clothes.

20. And the king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying,

21. Go, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for those who are left in Israel and Judah, concerning the Words of the Book that has been found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that has been poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the Word of Jehovah, to do according to all that is written in this Book.

22. So Hilkiah and those from the king went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe. (She was living in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter.) And they spoke to her regarding this.

23. And she answered them, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Tell the man who has sent you to Me,

24. Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I am bringing evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the Book which they have read before the king of Judah,

25. because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods, to provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands. Therefore My wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.

26. But as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus you shall speak to him, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, whose Words you have heard:

27. Because your heart has been tender, and you humbled yourself before God when you heard His Words against this place and against its inhabitants, and you humbled yourself before Me, and you tore your clothes and wept before Me, I also have heard you, says Jehovah.

28. Behold, I am gathering you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace; and your eyes shall not see all the evil which I am bringing upon this place and its inhabitants. So they brought back word to the king.

29. Then the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.

30. And the king went up to the house of Jehovah, with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; the priests and the Levites, and all the people, great and small. And he read in their ears all the Words of the Book of the Covenant which had been found in the house of Jehovah.

31. And the king stood in his place and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His statutes with all his heart and all his soul, to do the Words of the covenant that were written in this Book.

32. And he caused all who were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. So the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.

33. And Josiah removed all the abominations from all the land of the children of Israel, and caused all who were found in Israel to serve, being subject unto Jehovah their God. All his days they did not depart from following Jehovah the God of their fathers.

## 2 Chronicles 35

1. And Josiah kept a Passover unto Jehovah in Jerusalem, and they slaughtered the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.

2. And he stationed the priests at their charges and encouraged them in the service of the house of Jehovah.

3. And he said to the Levites who were teaching all Israel, who were set apart unto Jehovah: Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, has built. It shall not be a burden on your shoulders. Now serve Jehovah your God and His people Israel.

4. Prepare yourselves according to your fathers houses, according to your divisions, according to the writings of David king of Israel and the writings of Solomon his son.

5. And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers houses of your brethren, the sons of the people, and according to the division of the fathers house of the Levites.

6. Now slaughter the Passover, consecrate yourselves, and prepare them for your brethren, that they may do according to the Word of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.

7. And Josiah gave the sons of the people lambs and young goats from the flock, all for Passover for all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, as well as three thousand oxen; these were from the kings possessions.

8. And his rulers contributed willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests two thousand six hundred Passover lambs, and three hundred oxen.

9. Also Conaniah, his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, contributed to the Levites five thousand Passover lambs, and five hundred oxen.

10. Thus the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their places, and the Levites in their divisions, according to the kings command.

11. And they slaughtered the Passover lambs; and the priests sprinkled the blood with their hands, while the Levites were flaying.

12. And they removed the burnt offerings to distribute them by the divisions of the fathers houses to the sons of the people, to offer unto Jehovah, as it is written in the Book of Moses; and also with the oxen.

13. They also roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance; and the other holy things they boiled in pots, in kettles, and in pans, and brought them quickly to all the sons of the people.

14. Then afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, were busy in offering burnt offerings and fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron.

15. And the singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their places, according to the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the kings seer. Also the gatekeepers were at each gate; they did not leave their service, because their brethren the Levites prepared for them.

16. Thus all the service of Jehovah was prepared the same day, to keep the Passover and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of Jehovah, according to the command of King Josiah.

17. And the children of Israel found there, kept the Passover at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days.

18. And there had not been kept in Israel any Passover like that since the days of Samuel the prophet; and none of the kings of Israel had kept such a Passover as Josiah kept, with the priests and the Levites, all Judah and Israel found there, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

19. In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept.

20. After all this, when Josiah had prepared the house, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates; and Josiah went out to meet him.

21. But he sent messengers to him, saying, What have I to do with you, O king of Judah? I have not come against you this day, but against the house with which I have war; for God has commanded me to make haste. Refrain from meddling with God, who is with me, that you not be destroyed.

22. Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself so that he might fight with him, and did not heed the words of Necho from the mouth of God. So he came to fight in the Valley of Megiddo.

23. And the archers shot King Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Take me away, for I am severely wounded.

24. His servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had, and they brought him to Jerusalem. So he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.

25. Jeremiah also lamented for Josiah. And to this day all the singing men and the singing women speak of Josiah in their lamentations. They made it an ordinance in Israel; and behold, they are written in the Lamentations.

26. Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his goodness, according to what was written in the Law of Jehovah,

27. and his deeds from first to last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

## 2 Chronicles 36

1. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his fathers place in Jerusalem.

2. Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.

3. And the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem; and he fined the land one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.

4. Then the king of Egypt made Jehoahazs brother Eliakim king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother and brought him to Egypt.

5. Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah his God.

6. Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him, and bound him in bronze fetters to carry him to Babylon.

7. Nebuchadnezzar also brought away some of the vessels from the house of Jehovah to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.

8. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, the abominations which he had done, and what was found against him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.

9. Jehoiachin was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months and ten days. And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah.

10. At the turn of the year King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon, with the precious vessels from the house of Jehovah, and made Zedekiah, Jehoiakims brother, king over Judah and Jerusalem.

11. Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.

12. And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah his God, and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke from the mouth of Jehovah.

13. And he also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had adjured him by God; but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to Jehovah the God of Israel.

14. Moreover all the rulers of the priests and the people trespassed with great unfaithfulness, according to all the abominations of the nations, and defiled the house of Jehovah which He had consecrated in Jerusalem.

15. And Jehovah the God of their fathers sent to them by the hand of His messengers, rising early to send them, because He had compassion on His people and on His dwelling place.

16. But they mocked the messengers of God, despised His words, and scoffed at His prophets, to make the wrath of Jehovah swell up against His people, till there was no healing.

17. Therefore He brought against them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, on the aged or the weak; He gave them all into his hand.

18. And all the vessels from the house of God, great and small, the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king and of his rulers, all these he carried away to Babylon.

19. And they burned the house of God, broke down the wall of Jerusalem, burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed every desirable thing.

20. And those who escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon, where they became servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia;

21. to fulfill the Word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths. All the days to lay desolate, it kept the Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.

22. And in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, to fulfill the Word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and also put it in writing, saying,

23. Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: Jehovah the God of the heavens has given to me all the kingdoms of the earth; and He has laid a charge upon me to build Him a house at Jerusalem which is in Judah. Whoever among you of all His people: Jehovah his God be with him, and let him go up.
