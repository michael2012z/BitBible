46. all who were numbered were six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty.

49. Only the tribe of Levi you shall not number, nor take a head count of them among the sons of Israel;

50. but you shall appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the Testimony, over all its furnishings, and over all things that belong to it; they shall carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; they shall serve for it and camp around the tabernacle.

51. And when the tabernacle sets out, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up. The stranger who comes near shall be put to death.

52. The children of Israel shall pitch their tents, everyone by his own camp, everyone by his own standard, according to their armies;

54. Thus the children of Israel did; according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, thus they did.

## Numbers 3

1. Now these are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that Jehovah spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.

2. And these are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab, the firstborn; and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

3. These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, whom he consecrated to serve as priests.

4. Nadab and Abihu died before Jehovah when they offered strange fire before Jehovah in the wilderness of Sinai; and they had no children. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the presence of Aaron their father.

5. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:

6. Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may serve him.

7. And they shall keep his charge and the charge of the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle.

8. And they shall have charge of all the utensils of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle.

9. And you shall give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are assigned to him from among the sons of Israel.

10. Thus you shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall have charge of the priesthood; but the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.

11. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:

12. And behold, I Myself have taken the Levites from among the sons of Israel instead of every firstborn who opens the womb among the sons of Israel. Therefore the Levites shall be Mine,

13. because all the firstborn are Mine. On the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated to Myself every firstborn in Israel, both man and beast. They are Mine: I am Jehovah.

14. And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying:

15. Number the sons of Levi by their fathers houses, by their families; you shall number every male from a month old and above.

16. So Moses numbered them at the mouth of Jehovah, as he had been commanded.

17. And these were the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

18. And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei.

19. And the sons of Kohath by their families: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.

20. And the sons of Merari by their families: Mahli and Mushi. These, the families of the Levites by their fathers houses.

21. From Gershon came the family of the Libnites and the family of the Shimites; these were the families of the Gershonites.

22. Those who were numbered, according to the number of all the males from a month old and above; of those who were numbered there were seven thousand five hundred.

23. The families of the Gershonites were to encamp behind the tabernacle westward.

24. And the leader of the fathers house of the Gershonites was Eliasaph the son of Lael.

25. The charge of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting was the tabernacle, the tent with its covering, the screen for the door of the tent of meeting,

26. the screen for the door of the court, the hangings of the court which are around the tabernacle and the altar, and their cords, according to all their work.

27. From Kohath came the family of the Amramites, the family of the Izharites, the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites; these were the families of the Kohathites.

28. The number of all the males, from a month old and above, were eight thousand six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary.

29. The families of the sons of Kohath were to encamp on the south side of the tabernacle.

30. And the leader of the fathers house of the families of the Kohathites was Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.

31. Their charge was the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the utensils of the sanctuary with which they ministered, the veil, and all their service.

32. And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest was chief over the leaders of the Levites, with oversight of those who kept charge of the sanctuary.

33. From Merari came the family of the Mahlites and the family of the Mushites; these were the families of Merari.

34. And those who were numbered, according to the number of all the males from a month old and above, were six thousand two hundred.

35. The leader of the fathers house of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail. These were to encamp on the north side of the tabernacle.

36. And the oversight and charge of the sons of Merari was the boards of the tabernacle, its bars, its pillars, its sockets, its utensils, all their service,

37. and the pillars of the court all around, with their sockets, their pegs, and their cords.

38. And those who were to encamp before the tabernacle on the east, before the tent of meeting, were Moses, Aaron, and his sons, keeping charge of the sanctuary, to keep the charge of the children of Israel. And the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.

39. All who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the mouth of Jehovah, by their families, all the males from a month old and above, were twenty-two thousand.

40. And Jehovah said to Moses: Number all the firstborn males of the children of Israel from a month old and above, and take the number of their names.

41. And you shall take the Levites for Me (I am Jehovah) instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the cattle of the children of Israel.

42. So Moses numbered all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, as Jehovah had commanded him.

43. And all the firstborn males, according to the number of names from a month old and above, of those who were numbered of them, were twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-three.

44. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:

45. Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle. The Levites are Mine: I am Jehovah.

46. And for the redemption of the two hundred and seventy-three of the firstborn of the sons of Israel, who are more than the Levites,

47. you shall take five shekels per head; you shall take them according to the shekel of the sanctuary, the shekel of twenty gerahs.

48. And you shall give the money, with which the excess number of them is redeemed, to Aaron and his sons.

49. So Moses took the redemption money from those who were over and above those who were redeemed by the Levites.

50. From the firstborn of the sons of Israel he took the money, one thousand three hundred and sixty-five shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.

51. And Moses gave their redemption money to Aaron and his sons, at the mouth of Jehovah, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.

## Numbers 4

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:

2. Take a head count of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families, by their fathers house,

3. from thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, all who enter the service to do the work in the tent of meeting.

4. This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting, regarding the set apart, holy things:

5. When the camp sets out, Aaron and his sons shall come, and they shall take down the covering veil, and cover the ark of the Testimony with it.

6. And they shall put on it a covering of badger skins, and spread over that a cloth entirely of violet; and they shall insert its poles.

7. On the table of the Bread of the Presence they shall spread a violet cloth, and put on it the dishes, the spoons, the bowls, and the jars for pouring; and the continual bread shall be on it.

8. They shall spread over them a scarlet cloth, and cover it with a covering of badger skins; and they shall insert its poles.

9. And they shall take a violet cloth and cover the lampstand of the light, with its lamps, its snuffers, its trays, and all its oil vessels, with which they serve it.

10. And they shall put it with all its utensils into a covering of badger skins, and put it on a bar.

11. Over the golden altar they shall spread a violet cloth, and cover it with a covering of badger skins; and they shall insert its poles.

12. And they shall take all the utensils of service with which they minister in the sanctuary, put them in a violet cloth, cover them with a covering of badger skins, and put them on a bar.

13. And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth over it.

14. They shall put on it all its implements with which they minister there; the firepans, the forks, the shovels, the basins, and all the utensils of the altar; and they shall spread on it a covering of badger skins, and insert its poles.

15. And when Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, when the camp sets out then the sons of Kohath shall come to carry them; but they shall not touch the holy things, lest they die. These are the burdens of the tent of meeting for the sons of Kohath.

16. The charge of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest is the oil for the light, the spiced incense, the continual grain offering, the anointing oil, the oversight of all the tabernacle, of all that is in it, with the sanctuary and its furnishings.

17. And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:

18. Do not cut off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites;

19. but do this to them, that they may live and not die when they approach the set apart, holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in and appoint each man to his service and his burden.

20. But they shall not go in to watch while the holy things are being covered, that they not die.

21. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:

22. Also take a head count of the sons of Gershon, by their fathers house, by their families.

23. From thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, you shall number them, all who enter to perform the service, to do the work in the tent of meeting.

24. This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving and the burdens:

25. They shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle and the tent of meeting with its covering, the covering of badger skins that is on it, the screen for the door of the tent of meeting,

26. the screen for the door of the gate of the court, the hangings of the court which are around the tabernacle and altar, and their cords, all the furnishings for their service and all that is made for these things: thus shall they serve.

27. At the mouth of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, all their burdens and all their service. And you shall assign to them the charge of their burdens.

28. This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting. And their charge shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

29. As for the sons of Merari, you shall number them by their families and by their fathers house.

30. From thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, you shall assign them, everyone who enters the service to do the work of the tent of meeting.

31. And this is the charge of their burden according to all their service for the tent of meeting: the boards of the tabernacle, its bars, its pillars, its sockets,

32. and the pillars around the court with their sockets, pegs, and cords, with all their furnishings and all their service; and you shall assign to each man by name the utensils of the charge of his burden.

33. This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service for the tent of meeting, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

34. And Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families and by their fathers house,

35. from thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for the work in the tent of meeting;

36. and those who were numbered by their families were two thousand seven hundred and fifty.

37. These were those who were numbered of the families of the Kohathites, all who might serve in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the mouth of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.

38. And those who were numbered of the sons of Gershon, by their families and by their fathers house,

39. from thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for the work in the tent of meeting;

40. those who were numbered by their families, by their fathers house, were two thousand six hundred and thirty.

41. These were those who were numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon, of all who might serve in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the mouth of Jehovah.

42. And those who were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, by their families, by their fathers house,

45. These were those who were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the mouth of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.

46. All who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of Israel numbered, by their families and by their fathers house,

48. those who were numbered were eight thousand five hundred and eighty.

49. At the mouth of Jehovah they were numbered by the hand of Moses, each man according to his service and according to his burden; thus were they numbered by him, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.

## Numbers 5

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:

2. Command the children of Israel that they send out of the camp every leper, everyone who has a discharge, and everyone who is unclean because of the dead.

3. You shall send out both male and female; you shall send them outside the camp, that they not defile their camps in the midst of which I dwell.

4. And the children of Israel did so, and sent them outside the camp; as Jehovah had spoken to Moses, so the children of Israel did.

5. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

6. Speak to the children of Israel: When a man or woman commits any sin that men commit in unfaithfulness against Jehovah, and that soul is guilty,

7. then they shall confess the sin which they have done. He shall make restitution for his trespass in full, add a fifth to it, and give it to the one he has wronged.

8. But if the man has no relative to whom restitution may be made for the wrong, the restitution for the wrong shall go to Jehovah for the priest, besides the ram of the atonement with which atonement is made for him.

9. Every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring to the priest, shall be his.

10. And every mans holy things shall be his; whatever any man gives to the priest shall be his.

11. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

12. Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: If any mans wife turns aside and transgresses in unfaithfulness toward him,

13. and a man has lain with her with the seed of intercourse, and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband, and it is concealed that she has been defiled, and there was no witness against her, nor has she been caught;

14. if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he becomes jealous of his wife, who has been defiled; or if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he becomes jealous of his wife, although she has not been defiled;

15. then the man shall bring his wife to the priest. He shall bring the offering for her, one-tenth of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil on it and put no frankincense on it, because it is a grain offering of jealousy, an offering for remembering, for bringing iniquity to remembrance.

16. And the priest shall bring her near, and make her stand before Jehovah.

17. The priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel, and take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water.

18. And the priest shall make the woman stand before Jehovah, uncover the womans head, and put the offering for remembering in her hands, which is the grain offering of jealousy. And in the priests hand shall be the bitter water that brings a curse.

19. And the priest shall charge her under oath, and say to the woman, If no man has lain with you, and if you have not turned aside to uncleanness while under your husband, be free from this bitter water that brings a curse.

20. But if you have turned aside while under your husband, and if you have been defiled and some man besides your husband has lain with you;

21. then the priest shall charge the woman under the oath of the curse, and he shall say to the woman: Jehovah make you a curse and an oath among your people, when Jehovah makes your thigh waste away and your belly swell;

22. and this water that causes the curse shall go into your stomach, and make your belly swell and your thigh waste away. And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.

23. And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall wipe them off into the bitter water.

24. And he shall make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and the water that brings the curse shall enter into her to become bitter.

25. And the priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy from the womans hand, shall wave the offering before Jehovah, and bring it to the altar;

26. and the priest shall take a handful of the offering, as its memorial portion, burn it on the altar with smoke, and afterward make the woman drink the water.

27. When he has made her drink the water, then it shall be, if she has been defiled and transgressed in unfaithfulness toward her husband, that the water that brings a curse shall enter into her and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, her thigh shall waste away, and the woman shall become a curse among her people.

28. But if the woman has not been defiled, and is pure, then she shall be free and shall conceive children.

29. This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, while under her husband, turns aside and has been defiled;

30. or when the spirit of jealousy comes upon a man, and he becomes jealous of his wife; then he shall make the woman stand before Jehovah, and the priest shall pass all this law upon her.

31. And the man shall be free from iniquity, but the woman shall bear her iniquity.

## Numbers 6

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When either a man or woman makes an extraordinary vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself unto Jehovah,

3. he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink; he shall drink neither vinegar made from wine nor vinegar made from strong drink; neither shall he drink any grape juice, nor eat fresh grapes or dried.

4. All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is produced from the grapevine, from seed to skin.

5. All the days of the vow of his separation no razor shall pass over his head; until the days are fulfilled for which he separated himself unto Jehovah, he shall be holy; he shall allow the locks of the hair of his head to grow.

6. All the days that he separates himself unto Jehovah he shall not go near a dead person.

7. He shall not make himself unclean for his father or his mother, for his brother or his sister, at their death, because his consecration unto God is upon his head.

8. All the days of his separation he shall be holy unto Jehovah.

9. And if in dying anyone dies very suddenly beside him, and he defiles his consecrated head, then he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day he shall shave it.

10. And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting;

11. and the priest shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, because he has sinned regarding the dead person; and he shall consecrate his head that same day.

12. He shall dedicate unto Jehovah the days of his separation, and bring a male lamb of the first year as a trespass offering; and the former days are lost, because his separation was defiled.

13. And this is the law of the Nazirite: When the days of his separation are fulfilled, he shall be brought to the door of the tent of meeting.

14. And he shall present his offering unto Jehovah: one male lamb of the first year that is whole as a burnt offering, one ewe lamb of the first year that is whole as a sin offering, one ram that is whole as a peace offering,

15. a basket of unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their grain offering with their drink offerings.

16. And the priest shall bring them before Jehovah and offer his sin offering and his burnt offering;

17. and he shall offer the ram as a sacrifice of peace offerings unto Jehovah, with the basket of unleavened cakes; the priest shall also offer its grain offering and its drink offering.

18. And the Nazirite shall shave his consecrated head at the door of the tent of meeting, and shall take the hair from his consecrated head and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.

19. And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, one unleavened cake from the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and put them upon the hands of the Nazirite after he has shaved his consecrated hair,

20. and the priest shall wave them as a wave offering before Jehovah; they are holy for the priest, together with the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering. Afterward the Nazirite may drink wine.

21. This is the law of the Nazirite who vows unto Jehovah the offering for his separation, and besides that, whatever his hand is able to afford; according to the vow which he vows, thus he shall do according to the law of his separation.

22. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:

23. Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, In this manner you shall bless the children of Israel. Say unto them:

24. Jehovah bless you and keep you;

25. Jehovah make His face shine upon you, and be gracious unto you;

26. Jehovah lift up His presence upon you, and give you peace.

27. Thus they shall put My name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them.

## Numbers 7

1. And it came to pass on the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, that he anointed it and consecrated it and all its furnishings, and the altar and all its utensils; thus he anointed them and consecrated them.

2. And the leaders of Israel, the heads of their fathers houses, who were the leaders of the tribes and over those who were numbered, brought offerings.

3. And they brought their offering before Jehovah, six covered carts and twelve oxen, a cart for every two of the leaders, and for each one an ox; and they presented them before the tabernacle.

4. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

5. Receive it from them, that they may be used in doing the service of the tent of meeting; and you shall give them to the Levites, to every man according to his service.

6. So Moses took the carts and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.

7. Two carts and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service;

8. and four carts and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

9. But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because theirs was the service of the holy things, which they carried on their shoulders.

10. And the leaders offered the dedication offering for the altar on the day it was anointed; thus the leaders offered their offering before the altar.

89. And when Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with Him, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the Testimony, from between the two cherubim; thus He spoke to him.

## Numbers 8

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:

2. Speak to Aaron, and say to him, When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand.

3. And Aaron did so; he set up the lamps to face toward the front of the lampstand, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.

4. And the workmanship of the lampstand was hammered gold; from its shaft to its flowers it was hammered work. According to the pattern which Jehovah had shown Moses, so he had made the lampstand.

5. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:

6. Take the Levites from among the sons of Israel and cleanse them.

7. Thus you shall do to them to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of sin offering on them, and they shall pass a razor over all their flesh and wash their clothes, and thus purify themselves.

8. And let them take a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you shall take another young bull as a sin offering.

9. And you shall bring the Levites before the tent of meeting, and you shall gather together the whole congregation of the children of Israel.

10. And you shall bring the Levites before Jehovah, and the sons of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites;

11. and Aaron shall wave the Levites before Jehovah, as a wave offering from the sons of Israel, to serve in the service of Jehovah.

12. And the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the young bulls, and you shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering unto Jehovah, to make atonement for the Levites.

13. And you shall have the Levites stand before Aaron and his sons, and offer them as a wave offering unto Jehovah.

14. Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the sons of Israel, and the Levites shall be Mine.

15. Afterward the Levites shall go in to serve the tent of meeting. Thus you shall cleanse them and wave them, a wave offering.

16. For they are wholly given to Me from among the sons of Israel; I have taken them for Myself instead of all who open the womb, the firstborn of all the sons of Israel.

17. For every firstborn among the sons of Israel is Mine, both man and beast; on the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I consecrated them to Myself.

18. I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn of the sons of Israel.

19. And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the sons of Israel, to serve in the service of the children of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel, that there be no plague among the children of Israel by the children of Israel coming near the sanctuary.

20. Thus Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the sons of Israel did to the Levites; according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, thus the sons of Israel did to them.

21. And the Levites were purified and washed their clothes; and Aaron waved them as a wave offering before Jehovah, and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.

22. Afterward the Levites went in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron and his sons; as Jehovah had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, thus they did to them.

23. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

24. This is what applies to the Levites: From twenty-five years old and above one shall enter to go forth to serve in the service of the tent of meeting;

25. and at the age of fifty years they shall return from going forth to this service, and shall serve no more.

26. They shall minister with their brethren in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, but they shall not serve in any service. Thus you shall do to the Levites concerning their charge.

## Numbers 9

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying:

2. Let the children of Israel observe the Passover at its appointed time.

3. On the fourteenth day of this month, in the evening, you shall observe it at its appointed time. According to all its statutes and according to all its ordinances you shall observe it.

4. So Moses spoke to the children of Israel to observe the Passover.

5. And they observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month, at evening, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses, thus the children of Israel did.

6. Now there were certain men who were defiled by a dead man, so that they could not observe the Passover on that day; and they came before Moses and Aaron that day.

7. And those men said to him, We are defiled by a dead man. Why are we kept from offering the offering of Jehovah at its appointed time among the children of Israel?

8. And Moses said to them, Stand by, that I may hear what Jehovah will command concerning you.

9. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

10. Speak to the children of Israel, saying: If anyone of you or your generations is unclean because of a dead person, or is far away on a journey, he shall still observe the Passover unto Jehovah.

11. On the fourteenth day of the second month, at evening, they shall observe it. They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

12. They shall leave none of it until morning, nor break any of its bones. According to all the ordinances of the Passover they shall observe it.

13. But the man who is clean and is not on a journey, and has ceased to observe the Passover, that soul shall be cut off from among his people, because he did not bring the offering of Jehovah at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin.

14. And if a stranger sojourns among you, and would keep the Passover unto Jehovah, he shall do so according to the statute of the Passover and according to its ordinance; you shall have one ordinance, both for the sojourner and the native of the land.

15. And on the day that the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the Testimony; from evening until morning it was above the tabernacle like the appearance of fire.

16. Thus it was always: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.

17. Whenever the cloud was taken up from above the tent, after that the children of Israel would set out; and in the place where the cloud settled, there the children of Israel would encamp.

18. At the mouth of Jehovah the children of Israel would set out, and at the mouth of Jehovah they would encamp; for as many days as the cloud stayed above the tabernacle they remained encamped.

19. When the cloud continued long, many days above the tabernacle, the children of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah and did not set out.

20. So it was, when the cloud was above the tabernacle a number of days: according to the mouth of Jehovah they would remain encamped, and according to the mouth of Jehovah they would set out.

21. So it was, when the cloud remained from evening until morning: when the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they would set out; whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud was taken up, they would set out.

22. Whether it was two days, a month, or a year that the cloud remained above the tabernacle, the children of Israel would remain encamped and not set out; but when it was taken up, they would set out.

23. At the mouth of Jehovah they remained encamped, and at the mouth of Jehovah they set out; they kept the charge of Jehovah, at the mouth of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.

## Numbers 10

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:

2. Make two silver trumpets for yourself; you shall make them of hammered work. They shall be for assembling the congregation and for the setting out of the camps.

3. When they blow with them, all the congregation shall gather before you at the door of the tent of meeting.

4. And if they blow with one, then the leaders, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather to you.

5. When you sound the alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall then set out.

6. When you sound the alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall set out; they shall sound the alarm for them to set out.

7. And when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but not sound the alarm.

8. The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and this shall be to you as a perpetual ordinance throughout your generations.

9. And when you go to war in your land against the enemy who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, and you will be remembered before Jehovah your God, and you shall be delivered from your enemies.

10. Also in the day of your gladness, at your appointed times, and at the beginning of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be a memorial for you before your God: I am Jehovah your God.

11. Now it came to pass on the twentieth of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from above the tabernacle of the Testimony.

12. And the children of Israel set out from the wilderness of Sinai on their journeys; and the cloud settled down in the wilderness of Paran.

13. Thus they first set out at the mouth of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.

14. The standard of the camp of the children of Judah set out first according to their armies; over their army was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

15. Over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar.

16. And over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.

17. And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set out, carrying the tabernacle.

18. And the standard of the camp of Reuben set out according to their armies; over their army was Elizur the son of Shedeur.

19. Over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

20. And over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.

21. And the Kohathites set out, carrying the sanctuary. (The tabernacle had been prepared for them to come.)

22. And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set out according to their armies; over their army was Elishama the son of Ammihud.

23. Over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

24. And over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.

25. And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan (the rear guard of all the camps) set out according to their armies; over their army was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

26. Over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran.

27. And over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.

28. Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel, according to their armies, when they set out.

29. And Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses father-in-law, We are setting out for the place of which Jehovah has said, I will give it to you. Come with us, and we will treat you well; for Jehovah has promised good to Israel.

30. And he said to him, I will not go, but I will depart to my own land and to my kindred.

31. And he said, Please do not leave, inasmuch as you know how we are to camp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes.

32. And it shall be, if you go with us; indeed it shall be; that whatever good Jehovah will do to us, the same we shall do to you.

33. So they departed from the mountain of Jehovah on a journey of three days; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah set out before them for the three days journey, to search out a resting place for them.

34. And the cloud of Jehovah was above them by day when they set out from the camp.

35. Thus it was, whenever the ark set out, that Moses said: Rise up, O Jehovah! Let Your enemies be scattered, and let those who hate You flee before You.

36. And when it rested, he said: Return, O Jehovah, to the multitudes of the thousands of Israel.

## Numbers 11

1. Now the people murmured, and it was evil in the ears of Jehovah; for Jehovah heard it, and His anger burned. And the fire of Jehovah burned among them, and consumed those in the outskirts of the camp.

2. And the people cried out to Moses, and when Moses made intercession unto Jehovah, the fire was quenched.

3. And he called the name of the place Taberah, because the fire of Jehovah had burned among them.

4. And the mixed multitude who were among them lusted after their lusts; and the children of Israel turned back and wept, saying: Who will give us flesh to eat?

5. We remember the fish which we ate freely in Egypt, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic;

6. but now our soul is dried up; there is nothing at all except this manna before our eyes!

7. Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium.

8. The people went about and gathered it, ground it on millstones or beat it in the mortar, cooked it in pans, and made cakes of it; and its taste was like the taste of juicy oil.

9. And when the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna fell on it.

10. And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, everyone at the door of his tent; and the anger of Jehovah burned greatly; and it was evil in the eyes of Moses.

11. And Moses said to Jehovah, Why have You afflicted Your servant? And why have I not found favor in Your eyes, to lay the burden of all these people on me?

12. Have I conceived all these people? Have I begotten them, that You say to me, Carry them in your bosom, as a supporting father carries a nursing child, to the land which You have sworn to their fathers?

13. Where would I get flesh to set before all these people? For they weep upon me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.

14. I am not able to bear all these people alone, because they are too heavy for me.

15. If You are dealing with me like this, please kill and destroy me, if I have found favor in Your eyes; and do not let me see my distress!

16. And Jehovah said to Moses: Gather unto Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be elders of the people and officers over them; bring them to the tent of meeting, and they shall stand there with you.

17. And I will come down and speak with you there. And I will take of the Spirit that is upon you and will lay upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you not bear it yourself alone.

18. And you shall say to the people, Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat flesh; for you have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who will give us flesh to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt. Therefore Jehovah will give you flesh, and you shall eat.

19. You shall eat, not one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days,

20. but to a month of days, until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have despised Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before Him, saying, Why have we come up out of Egypt?

21. And Moses said, The people whom I am among are six hundred thousand footmen; yet You have said, I will give them flesh, and they shall eat for a month of days.

22. Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to provide enough for them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to provide for them?

23. And Jehovah said to Moses, Is the hand of Jehovah shortened? Now you shall see whether My word shall come to pass unto you or not.

24. And Moses went out and spoke unto the people the words of Jehovah, and he gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and had them stand around the tent.

25. And Jehovah came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and laid upon the seventy men of the elders; and it happened, when the Spirit rested upon them, that they prophesied, although they did not do so again.

26. But two men had remained in the camp: the name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them. Now they were among those enrolled, but had not gone out to the tent; and they prophesied in the camp.

27. And a young man ran and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.

28. And Joshua the son of Nun, minister to Moses, a youth, answered and said, Moses my lord, stop them!

29. And Moses said to him, Are you jealous for my sake? Oh, that all the people of Jehovah were prophets and that Jehovah would put His Spirit upon them!

30. And Moses withdrew into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.

31. And a wind went forth from Jehovah, and it brought quail from the sea and left them near the camp, about a days journey here and about a days journey there, all around the camp, about two cubits above the surface of the ground.

32. And the people arose all that day, all night, and all the next day, and gathered the quail (he who gathered least gathered ten homers); and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.

33. And while the flesh was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the wrath of Jehovah burned against the people, and Jehovah struck the people with a very great plague.

34. And he called the name of that place Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who lusted.

35. From Kibroth Hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth, and camped at Hazeroth.

## Numbers 12

1. And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman.

2. And they said, Has Jehovah indeed spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken through us also? And Jehovah heard it.

3. (Now the man Moses was very meek, more than any man on the face of the earth.)

4. And Jehovah suddenly said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting! And the three came out.

5. And Jehovah came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of the tent, and summoned Aaron and Miriam; and they both went forward.

6. And He said, Hear now My words: If there is a prophet among you, I, Jehovah, reveal Myself to him in a vision; I speak to him in a dream.

7. Not so with My servant Moses! He is faithful in all My house.

8. I speak with him mouth to mouth, even by appearance, and not in riddles; and he looks upon the form of Jehovah. Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant Moses?

9. And the anger of Jehovah burned against them, and He departed.

10. And when the cloud departed from above the tent, behold Miriam was leprous as snow. And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and behold, she had leprosy.

11. And Aaron said to Moses, Oh my lord I beseech you! Do not lay this sin upon us, in which we have done foolishly and in which we have sinned.

12. I beseech you, do not let her be as one dead, whose flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mothers womb!

13. And Moses cried out to Jehovah, saying, Please heal her, O Mighty God, I pray!

14. And Jehovah said to Moses, If her father had but spat in her face, would she not be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut out of the camp seven days, and afterward she shall be brought in.

15. And Miriam was shut out of the camp seven days, and the people did not journey till Miriam was brought in.

16. And afterward the people set out from Hazeroth and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.

## Numbers 13

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel; from each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man, every one a leader among them.

3. And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran at the mouth of Jehovah, all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel.

4. Now these were their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;

5. from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;

6. from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;

7. from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;

8. from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun;

9. from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;

10. from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;

11. from the tribe of Joseph, that is, from the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi;

12. from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;

13. from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;

14. from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;

15. from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.

16. These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua.

17. And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, Go up this way into the south, and go up into the mountains,

18. and see what the land is: whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, few or many;

19. whether the land they dwell in is good or bad; whether the cities they inhabit are like camps or strongholds;

20. whether the land is fat or lean; and whether there are forests there or not. Be of good courage. And bring some of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes.

21. So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, near the entrance of Hamath.

22. And they went up through the South and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, those born to Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)

23. And they came to the Valley of Eshcol, and there cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes; they carried it between two of them on a pole. They also brought some of the pomegranates and figs.

24. The place was called the Valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the sons of Israel cut down there.

25. And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.

26. And they departed and came to Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh; they brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.

27. And they reported to him and said: We went to the land where you sent us. It truly flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.

28. Nevertheless the people who dwell in the land are strong; the cities are fortified and very great; moreover we saw those born of Anak there.

29. The Amalekites dwell in the land of the South; the Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountains; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and beside the Jordan.

30. And Caleb silenced the people before Moses, and said, Let us arise to go up and take possession, for we are able to prevail.

31. But the men who had gone up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we.

32. And they gave the children of Israel a bad report of the land which they had spied out, saying, The land through which we have gone as spies is a land that devours its inhabitants, and all the people whom we saw in it are men of great stature.

33. There we saw the giants, the sons of Anak of the giants; and we were like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and so we were in their eyes.

## Numbers 14

1. And all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried, and the people wept that night.

2. And all the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron, and the whole congregation said to them, Oh that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or that only we had died in this wilderness!

3. Why is Jehovah bringing us to this land to fall by the sword, that our wives and children should become prey? Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?

4. So they said to one another, Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt.

5. Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.

6. But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, among those who spied out the land, tore their clothes;

7. and they spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying: The land we passed through to spy out is an exceedingly good land.

8. If Jehovah has delighted in us, then He will bring us into this land and give it to us; a land flowing with milk and honey.

9. Only do not rebel against Jehovah, nor fear the people of the land, for they are our bread; their shade has departed from them, and Jehovah is with us. Do not fear them.

10. And all the congregation intended to stone them with stones. And the glory of Jehovah appeared in the tent of meeting before all the children of Israel.

11. And Jehovah said to Moses: How long will these people reject Me? And how long will they not believe Me, with all the signs which I have done among them?

12. I will strike them with pestilence and dispossess them, and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.

13. And Moses said to Jehovah: Then the Egyptians will hear it (for by Your might You brought these people up from among them),

14. and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that You, Jehovah, are among these people; that You, Jehovah, are seen face to face and Your cloud stands above them, and You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.

15. Now if You kill these people as one man, then the nations which have heard of Your fame will speak, saying,

16. Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people to the land which He swore to give them, therefore He killed them in the wilderness.

17. And now, I beseech You, let the power of my Lord be great, just as You have spoken, saying,

18. Jehovah is longsuffering and abundant in mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression; but not acquitting to leave the guilty unpunished, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and fourth generation.

19. Pardon the iniquity of this people, I pray, according to the greatness of Your mercy, just as You have borne this people, from Egypt even until now.

20. And Jehovah said: I have pardoned, according to your word;

21. but truly, as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of Jehovah;

22. because all these men seeing My glory and the signs which I have done in Egypt and in the wilderness, and tested Me now these ten times, and have not heeded My voice,

23. they shall not see the land of which I have sworn to their fathers, nor shall any of those who rejected Me see it.

24. But My servant Caleb, because he has a different spirit in him and has followed Me fully, I will bring into the land where he went, and his seed shall possess it.

25. (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) Tomorrow turn and set out into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.

26. And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

27. How long shall I bear with this evil congregation who complain against Me? I have heard the murmurings which the children of Israel grumble against Me.

28. Say to them, As I live, says Jehovah, just as you have spoken in My ears, so I will do to you:

29. The carcasses of you who have grumbled against Me shall fall in this wilderness, all of you who were numbered, according to your entire number, from twenty years old and above.

30. Except for Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun, you shall by no means enter the land which I raised My hand and swore to make you dwell there.

31. But your little ones, whom you said would be prey, I will bring in, and they shall know the land which you have rejected.

32. But as for you, your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness.

33. And your sons shall be shepherds in the wilderness forty years, and bear your harlotry, until your carcasses are consumed in the wilderness.

34. According to the number of the days in which you spied out the land, forty days, for each day you shall bear your iniquities one year; forty years; and you shall know My opposition.

35. I Jehovah have spoken: I will surely do so to all this evil congregation who are gathered together against Me. In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.

36. Now the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation grumble against him by bringing an evil report of the land,

37. those very men who brought the evil report about the land, died by the plague before Jehovah.

38. But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive, of the men who went to spy out the land.

39. And Moses told these words to all the children of Israel, and the people mourned greatly.

40. And they arose early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, Here we are, and we will go up to the place which Jehovah has promised; for we have sinned.

41. And Moses said, Why do you transgress the mouth of Jehovah? For it will not prosper.

42. Do not go up, that you not be smitten before your enemies, for Jehovah is not among you.

43. For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and you shall fall by the sword, because you have turned away from Jehovah; Jehovah is not with you.

44. But they heedlessly went up to the top of the mountain; nevertheless, neither the ark of the covenant of Jehovah nor Moses departed from the camp.

45. And the Amalekites and the Canaanites who dwelt in that mountain came down and struck them, and beat them to pieces, to Hormah.

## Numbers 15

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When you have come into the land you are to inhabit, which I am giving to you,

3. and you make an offering by fire unto Jehovah, a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering or in your appointed times, to make a soothing aroma unto Jehovah, from the herd or the flock,

4. then he who presents his offering unto Jehovah shall bring a grain offering of one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-fourth of a hin of oil;

5. and one-fourth of a hin of wine as a drink offering you shall prepare with the burnt offering or the sacrifice, for each lamb.

6. Or for a ram you shall prepare as a grain offering two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-third of a hin of oil;

7. and as a drink offering you shall offer one-third of a hin of wine as a soothing aroma unto Jehovah.

8. And when you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering, or as a sacrifice to separate a vow, or as a peace offering unto Jehovah,

9. then shall be offered with the young bull a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil;

10. and you shall bring as the drink offering half a hin of wine as an offering by fire, a soothing aroma unto Jehovah.

11. Thus it shall be done for each young bull, for each ram, or for each lamb or young goat.

12. According to the number that you prepare, so you shall do with everyone according to their number.

13. All who are natives shall do these things in this manner, in presenting an offering by fire, a soothing aroma unto Jehovah.

14. And if a stranger sojourns with you, or whoever is among you throughout your generations, and would present an offering by fire, a soothing aroma unto Jehovah, just as you do, so shall he do.

15. One ordinance shall be for you of the assembly and for the stranger who sojourns with you, a perpetual ordinance throughout your generations; as it is for you, so shall it be for the sojourner before Jehovah.

16. One law and one custom shall be for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you.

17. Again Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

18. Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When you come into the land to which I am bringing you,

19. then it shall be, when you eat of the bread of the land, that you shall offer up a heave offering unto Jehovah.

20. You shall offer up a cake of the first of your ground meal as a heave offering; as a heave offering of the threshing floor, thus shall you offer it up.

21. Of the first of your ground meal you shall give unto Jehovah a heave offering throughout your generations.

22. If you sin unintentionally, and do not do all these commandments which Jehovah has spoken to Moses;

23. all that Jehovah has commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day Jehovah gave commandment and onward throughout your generations;

24. then it shall be, if it is done unintentionally, without the knowledge of the congregation, that the whole congregation shall offer one young bull as a burnt offering, as a soothing aroma unto Jehovah, with its grain offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one kid of the goats as a sin offering.

25. Thus the priest shall make atonement for the whole congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them, for it was unintentional; they shall bring their offering, an offering by fire unto Jehovah, and their sin offering before Jehovah, for their unintended sin.

26. It shall be forgiven the whole congregation of the children of Israel and the stranger who sojourns among them, because all the people did it unintentionally.

27. And if a soul sins unintentionally, then he shall bring a female goat of the first year as a sin offering.

28. Thus the priest shall make atonement for the soul who sins unintentionally, when he sins unintentionally before Jehovah, to make atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.

29. You shall have one law for him who sins unintentionally, for him who is a native among the children of Israel and for the stranger who sojourns among them.

30. But the soul who does anything loftily, whether he is a native or a sojourner, that one blasphemes Jehovah, and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

31. Because he has despised the Word of Jehovah, and has broken His commandment, that soul shall be cut down to be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.

32. Now while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.

33. And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.

34. And they put him under guard, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.

35. And Jehovah said to Moses, The man shall be executed to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp.

36. Therefore, as Jehovah commanded Moses, all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him with stones, and he died.

37. Again Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

38. Speak to the children of Israel and say to them to make fringes on the edges of their garments throughout their generations, and to put a violet thread in the fringes of the edges.

39. And the fringe shall be, that you may look upon it and remember all the commandments of Jehovah and do them, and that you not seek after that for which your own heart and eyes go whoring,

40. and that you remember and do all My commandments, and be holy unto your God.

41. I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Jehovah your God.

## Numbers 16

1. Now Korah the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men;

2. and they rose up before Moses with some of the sons of Israel, two hundred and fifty leaders of the congregation, representatives of the congregation, men of renown.

3. They gathered together against Moses and Aaron, and said to them, You take too much upon yourselves, for all the congregation is holy, every one of them, and Jehovah is among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of Jehovah?

4. And when Moses heard it, he fell on his face;

5. and he spoke to Korah and all his company, saying, Tomorrow morning Jehovah will show who is His and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to Him. The one whom He chooses He will cause to come near to Him.

6. Do this: Take censers, Korah and all your company;

7. put fire in them and put incense in them before Jehovah tomorrow, and it shall be that the man whom Jehovah chooses is the holy one. You take too much upon yourselves, you sons of Levi!

8. And Moses said to Korah, Hear now, you sons of Levi:

9. Is it a small thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to Himself, to do the work of the tabernacle of Jehovah, and to stand before the congregation to serve them;

10. and that He has brought you near to Himself, you and all your brethren, the sons of Levi, with you? And are you seeking the priesthood also?

11. Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against Jehovah. And what is Aaron that you grumble against him?

12. And Moses sent to summon Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, but they said, We will not come up.

13. Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, that you rule to lord it over us?

14. Moreover you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!

15. And Moses was very angry, and said to Jehovah, Do not respect their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, nor have I done evil to any of them.

16. And Moses said to Korah, Tomorrow, you and all your company be before Jehovah; you and they, as well as Aaron.

17. Each one take his censer and put incense in it, and each of you bring his censer before Jehovah, two hundred and fifty censers; you and Aaron, each with his censer.

18. And each man took his censer, put fire in it, laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.

19. And Korah gathered all the congregation against them at the door of the tent of meeting. And the glory of Jehovah appeared to all the congregation.

20. And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

21. Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.

22. And they fell on their faces, and said, O Mighty God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will You be angry with all the congregation?

23. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

24. Speak to the congregation, saying, Get away from around the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

25. And Moses arose and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.

26. And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart now from the tents of these wicked men! Touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins.

27. So they got away from around the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the door of their tents, with their wives, their sons, and their little children.

28. And Moses said: By this you shall know that Jehovah has sent me to do all these works, for I have not done them from my own heart.

29. If these men die the death of all men, or if they are visited according to the visitation of all men, then Jehovah has not sent me.

30. But if Jehovah creates a new thing, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into Sheol, then you shall understand that these men have rejected Jehovah.

31. And it came to pass, as he finished speaking all these words, that the ground split apart under them,

32. and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their houses and all the men with Korah, with all their possessions.

33. So they and all those with them went down alive into Sheol; the earth covered over them, and they perished from among the assembly.

34. And all Israel who were around them fled at the sound, for they thought, Lest the earth swallow us up also!

35. And a fire came forth from Jehovah and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering incense.

36. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:

37. Speak to Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, that he pick up the censers out of the burning, for they are holy, and scatter the fire away.

38. The censers of these men who sinned against their own souls, let them be made into broad plates as a covering for the altar; because they presented them before Jehovah, therefore they are holy; and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.

39. So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burned had presented, and they were beaten out as a covering for the altar,

40. as a memorial to the children of Israel; that no strange man, who is not a seed of Aaron, should come near to offer incense before Jehovah, that he might not become like Korah and his company, as Jehovah had spoken by the hand of Moses.

41. And the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, You have killed the people of Jehovah.

42. And it happened, when the congregation had gathered against Moses and Aaron, that they turned toward the tent of meeting; and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Jehovah appeared.

43. And Moses and Aaron came before the tent of meeting.

44. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

45. Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell on their faces.

46. And Moses said to Aaron, Take a censer and put fire in it from the altar, put incense on it, and take it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them; for wrath has gone out from Jehovah; the plague has begun.

47. And Aaron took as Moses had spoken, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and behold, the plague had begun among the people. So he put on the incense and made atonement for the people.

48. And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was restrained.

49. Now those who died in the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died in the matter of Korah.

50. And Aaron returned to Moses at the door of the tent of meeting, for the plague had been restrained.

## Numbers 17

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:

2. Speak to the children of Israel, and take from them a staff, a staff from each fathers house, all their leaders according to their fathers houses; twelve staffs. Write each mans name on his staff.

3. And you shall write Aarons name on the staff of Levi. For there shall be one staff for the head of each fathers house.

4. And you shall place them in the tent of meeting before the Testimony, where I meet with you.

5. And it shall be that the staff of the man whom I choose shall blossom; thus I will put to rest the murmurings of the children of Israel, with which they grumble against you.

6. And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and each of their leaders gave him a staff apiece, for each leader a staff according to their fathers houses, twelve staffs; and the staff of Aaron was among their staffs.

7. And Moses placed the staffs before Jehovah in the tent of witness.

8. And it came to pass on the next day that Moses went into the tent of witness, and behold, the staff of Aaron, of the house of Levi, had sprouted and put forth buds, had produced blossoms and yielded ripe almonds.

9. And Moses brought out all the staffs from before Jehovah to all the children of Israel; and they looked, and each man took his staff.

10. And Jehovah said to Moses, Bring Aarons staff back before the Testimony, to be kept as a sign against the rebels, that you may put their murmurings away from Me, that they not die.

11. Thus Moses did; as Jehovah had commanded him, so he did.

12. And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold we have died, we have perished, we have all perished!

13. Whoever comes near the tabernacle of Jehovah dies. Are we all about to die? Have we been consumed?

## Numbers 18

1. And Jehovah said to Aaron: You and your sons and your fathers house with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary, and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.

2. Also bring with you your brethren of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, that they may be joined with you and serve you while you and your sons are with you before the tent of witness.

3. They shall keep your charge and the charge of all the tent; but they shall not come near the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that they not die; they and you also.

4. They shall be joined to you and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent; but a stranger shall not come near you.

5. And you shall keep the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of the altar, that there be no more wrath upon the children of Israel.

6. And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel; they are a gift to you, given by Jehovah, to do the service of the tent of meeting.

7. Therefore you and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood in everything at the altar and behind the veil; and you shall serve. I give your priesthood to you as a gift of service, but the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.

8. And Jehovah spoke to Aaron: I, behold I have also given you the charge of My heave offerings, all the holy things of the children of Israel; I have given them to you and your sons because of the anointing, as a perpetual ordinance.

9. This shall be yours of the set apart, holy, things from the fire: every offering of theirs, every grain offering and every sin offering and every trespass offering which they return to Me, shall be set apart, holy, for you and your sons.

10. In a set apart, holy place you shall eat it; every male shall eat it. It shall be holy to you.

11. This also is yours: the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them to you, and your sons and daughters with you, as a perpetual ordinance. Everyone who is clean in your house shall eat it.

12. All the best of the oil, all the best of the new wine and the grain, the firstfruits which they offer unto Jehovah, I have given them to you.

13. The first ripe fruit that is in their land which they bring unto Jehovah shall be yours. Everyone who is clean in your house shall eat it.

14. Every devoted thing in Israel shall be yours.

15. Everything that opens the womb of all flesh, which they bring unto Jehovah, whether man or beast, shall be yours; nevertheless the firstborn of man you shall ransom to redeem, and the firstborn of unclean animals you shall redeem.

16. And the redeemed things you shall redeem after it is a month old, according to your valuation, for five shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary; which is twenty gerahs.

17. But the firstborn of a cow, the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar, and burn their fat with smoke as an offering by fire for a soothing aroma unto Jehovah.

18. And their flesh shall be yours, as the wave breast and the right thigh are yours.

19. All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto Jehovah, I have given to you and your sons and daughters with you as a perpetual ordinance; it is a covenant of salt always before Jehovah with you and your seed with you.

20. And Jehovah said to Aaron: You shall have no inheritance in their land, nor shall you have any portion among them; I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel.

21. Behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tithes in Israel as an inheritance in return for the service in which they serve, the service of the tent of meeting.

22. Neither shall the children of Israel come anymore near the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin and die.

23. But the Levites shall do the work of service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity; it shall be a perpetual statute, throughout your generations, that they shall have no inheritance among the children of Israel.

24. For the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer up as a heave offering unto Jehovah, I have given to the Levites as an inheritance; therefore I have said to them, They shall have no inheritance among the children of Israel.

25. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

26. Speak thus to the Levites, and say to them: When you take from the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them as your inheritance, then you shall offer up a heave offering of it unto Jehovah, a tithe of the tithe.

27. And your heave offering shall be reckoned to you as though it were the grain of the threshing floor and as the fullness of the winepress.

28. Thus you shall also offer a heave offering unto Jehovah from all your tithes which you receive from the children of Israel, and you shall give the heave offering of Jehovah from it to Aaron the priest.

29. Of all your gifts you shall offer up every heave offering of Jehovah, from all the best of them, the consecrated part of them.

30. Therefore you shall say to them: When you have lifted up the best of it, then the rest shall be accounted to the Levites as the produce of the threshing floor and as the produce of the winepress.

31. You shall eat it in any place, you and your houses, for it is your wages for your service in the tent of meeting.

32. And you shall bear no sin because of it, when you have lifted up from it the best of it. And you shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that you not die.

## Numbers 19

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

2. This is the ordinance of the Law which Jehovah has commanded, saying: Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring you a red heifer that is whole, in which there is no blemish and upon which a yoke has never come.

3. You shall give it to Eleazar the priest, and he shall lead it outside the camp, and it shall be slaughtered before him;

4. and Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, and sprinkle some of its blood seven times before the front of the tent of meeting.

5. And the heifer shall be burned before his eyes: its hide, its flesh, its blood, and its dung shall be burned.

6. And the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet, and cast them into the midst of the burning of the heifer.

7. Then the priest shall wash his clothes, he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp; the priest shall be unclean until evening.

8. And the one who burns it shall wash his clothes in water, bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until evening.

9. And a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place; and they shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for the water of impurity; it is for purifying from sin.

10. And the one who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until evening. It shall be a perpetual statute to the children of Israel and to the stranger who sojourns among them.

11. He who touches a man, his soul having died, shall be unclean seven days.

12. He shall purify himself from it on the third day and on the seventh day; then he shall be clean. But if he does not purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he shall not be clean.

13. Whoever touches a dead man, his soul having died, and does not purify himself, has defiled the tabernacle of Jehovah. That soul shall be cut off from Israel. He shall be unclean, because the water of impurity was not sprinkled upon him; his uncleanness is still upon him.

14. This is the law when a man dies in a tent: All who come into the tent and all who are in the tent shall be unclean seven days;

15. and every open vessel, which has no cover fastened on it, is unclean.

16. Whoever in the open field touches one who was pierced by a sword or who has died, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.

17. And for the unclean they shall take some of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification from sin, and running water shall be put on them in a vessel.

18. A clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water, sprinkle it on the tent, on all the vessels, on the persons who were there, or on the one who touched a bone, the slain, the dead, or a grave.

19. The clean person shall sprinkle the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, wash his clothes, and bathe in water; and at evening he shall be clean.

20. But the man who is unclean and does not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of Jehovah. The water of impurity has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean.

21. It shall be a perpetual statute for them. He who sprinkles the water of impurity shall wash his clothes; and he who touches the water of impurity shall be unclean until evening.

22. And whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the soul who touches it shall be unclean until evening.

## Numbers 20

1. And the children of Israel, the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month, and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there and was buried there.

2. And there was no water for the congregation; so they gathered together against Moses and Aaron.

3. And the people strove with Moses and spoke, saying: If only we had died when our brethren died before Jehovah!

4. Why have you brought up the assembly of Jehovah into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die here?

5. And why have you brought us up out of Egypt, to bring us to this evil place? It is not a place of sowing or figs or vines or pomegranates; nor is there any water to drink.

6. And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tent of meeting, and they fell on their faces. And the glory of Jehovah appeared to them.

7. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

8. Take the staff; you and your brother Aaron gather the congregation together. Speak to the rock before their eyes, and it shall produce water; thus you shall bring water for them out of the rock, and give drink to the congregation and their cattle.

9. And Moses took the staff from before Jehovah as He had commanded him.

10. And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock; and he said to them, Hear now, you rebels! Shall we bring water for you out of this rock?

11. And Moses lifted his hand and struck the rock twice with his staff; and water came out abundantly, and the congregation and their cattle drank.

12. And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, Because you did not believe Me, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given to them.

13. These were the waters of Meribah, because the children of Israel strove with Jehovah, and He was sanctified among them.

14. And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom. Thus says your brother Israel: You know all the hardship that has befallen us,

15. how our fathers went down to Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt many days, and the Egyptians did evil to us and our fathers.

16. And when we cried out unto Jehovah, He heard our voice and sent the Angel and brought us up out of Egypt; now here we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your border.

17. Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through fields or vineyards, nor will we drink water from wells; we will go along the Kings Highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left until we have passed through your territory.

18. And Edom said to him, You shall not pass through my land, lest I come out against you with the sword.

19. And the children of Israel said to him, We will go by the Highway, and if I or my livestock drink any of your water, then I will pay for it; let me only pass through on foot, without a word.

20. And he said, You shall not pass through. And Edom came out against them with many people and with a strong hand.

21. Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory; so Israel turned away from him.

22. And the children of Israel, the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor.

23. And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor by the border of the land of Edom, saying:

24. Aaron shall be gathered to his people, for he shall not enter the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against My mouth at the waters of Meribah.

25. Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor;

26. and strip Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son; for Aaron shall be gathered to his people and die there.

27. And Moses did as Jehovah commanded, and they went up to Mount Hor before the eyes of all the congregation.

28. Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. And Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.

29. And when all the congregation saw that Aaron had died, all the house of Israel mourned for Aaron thirty days.

## Numbers 21

1. And when King Arad, the Canaanite who dwelt in the south, heard that Israel was coming on the way to Atharim, he fought against Israel and took some of them captive.

2. And Israel vowed a vow unto Jehovah, and said, If You will grant to deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.

3. And Jehovah heard the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites, and they utterly destroyed them and their cities. So the name of that place was called Hormah.

4. And they journeyed from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; and the soul of the people became impatient on the way.

5. And the people spoke against God and against Moses: Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and our soul loathes this worthless bread.

6. And Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many of the people of Israel died.

7. Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against Jehovah and against you; intercede before Jehovah that He take away the serpents from us. So Moses interceded for the people.

8. And Jehovah said to Moses, Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and it shall be that anyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live.

9. And Moses made a bronze serpent, and put it on a pole; and so it was, if a serpent had bitten anyone, when he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived.

10. And the children of Israel set out and encamped in Oboth.

11. And they journeyed from Oboth and camped at Ije Abarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrise.

12. From there they set out and encamped in the valley of Zered.

13. From there they set out and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amorites; for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.

14. Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of Jehovah: Waheb in Suphah, the brooks of the Arnon,

15. and the slope of the brooks that extends down to the dwelling of Ar, and leans on the border of Moab.

16. From there they went to Beer, which is the well where Jehovah said to Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.

17. Then Israel sang this song: Spring up, O well! All of you sing to it;

18. the well the rulers dug, dug by the nobles of the people, by the Lawgiver, with their staffs. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah,

19. from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth,

20. and from Bamoth, in the valley that is in the land of Moab, to the top of Pisgah which looks down and faces the wilderness.

21. And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,

22. Let me pass through your land. We will not turn aside into fields or vineyards; we will not drink water from wells. We will go by the Kings Highway until we have passed through your territory.

23. But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. And Sihon gathered all his people together and went out against Israel in the wilderness, and he came to Jahaz and fought against Israel.

24. And Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.

25. And Israel took all these cities, and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon and in all its villages.

26. For Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and had taken all his land from his hand as far as the Arnon.

27. Therefore those who speak in proverbs say: Come to Heshbon, let it be built; let the city of Sihon be repaired.

28. For fire went out from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; it consumed Ar of Moab, the lords of the heights of the Arnon.

29. Woe to you, Moab! You have perished, O people of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity, to Sihon king of the Amorites.

30. But we have shot at them; Heshbon has perished as far as Dibon; and we laid waste as far as Nophah, which reaches to Medeba.

31. Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.

32. And Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took its villages and drove out the Amorites who were there.

33. And they turned and went up by the way to Bashan. So Og king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.

34. And Jehovah said to Moses, Do not fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, with all his people and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.

35. So they struck him, his sons, and all his people, until there was no survivor left; and they took possession of his land.

## Numbers 22

1. And the children of Israel set out, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan across from Jericho.

2. Now Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.

3. And Moab was exceedingly afraid of the people because they were many, and Moab was sick with dread because of the presence of the children of Israel.

4. And Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now this company will lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.

5. And he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor at Pethor, which is near the River in the land of the sons of his people, to summon him, saying: Behold, a people has come from Egypt. Behold, they cover the eye of the earth, and are staying next to me!

6. Therefore please come, curse this people for me, for they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall prevail and strike them and drive them out of the land, for I have perceived that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.

7. So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the diviners fee in their hand, and they came to Balaam and spoke to him the words of Balak.

8. And he said to them, Lodge here tonight, and I will bring back word to you, as Jehovah speaks to me. So the rulers of Moab stayed with Balaam.

9. And God came to Balaam and said, Who are these men with you?

10. And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, saying,

11. Behold, a people has come out of Egypt, and they cover the eye of the earth. Come now, curse them for me; perhaps I shall prevail to wage war and drive them out.

12. And God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.

13. And Balaam arose in the morning and said to the rulers of Balak, Go back to your land, for Jehovah has refused to give me permission to go with you.

14. And the rulers of Moab arose and went to Balak, and said, Balaam refuses to come with us.

15. And Balak again sent rulers, more numerous and more honorable than they.

16. And they came to Balaam and said to him, Thus says Balak the son of Zippor: Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me;

17. for I will honor you with great honor, and I will do whatever you say to me. Therefore please come, curse this people for me.

18. And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the mouth of Jehovah my God, to do less or more.

19. Now therefore, please, you also stay here tonight, that I may know what more Jehovah will say to me.

20. And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, If the men have come to summon you, arise and go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that you shall do.

21. And Balaam arose in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the rulers of Moab.

22. And Gods anger burned because he went, and the Angel of Jehovah stationed Himself in the way as an adversary against him. And he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants with him.

23. And the donkey saw the Angel of Jehovah standing in the way with His sword drawn in His hand, and the donkey turned aside out of the way and went into the field. So Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back onto the road.

24. And the Angel of Jehovah stood in a narrow path of the vineyards, with a wall on this side and a wall on that side.

25. And when the donkey saw the Angel of Jehovah, she pushed herself against the wall and crushed Balaams foot against the wall; so he struck her some more.

26. And the Angel of Jehovah went farther, and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.

27. And when the donkey saw the Angel of Jehovah, she lay down under Balaam; and Balaams anger burned, and he struck the donkey with his staff.

28. And Jehovah opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?

29. And Balaam said to the donkey, Because you have been cruel to me. I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would kill you!

30. And the donkey said to Balaam, Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden, ever since I became yours, to this day? Has it ever been my habit to do this to you? And he said, No.

31. Then Jehovah opened Balaams eyes, and he saw the Angel of Jehovah standing in the way with His sword drawn in His hand; and he bowed down and prostrated himself on his face.

32. And the Angel of Jehovah said to him, Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary against you, because your way is perverse before Me.

33. The donkey saw Me and turned aside from Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, surely now I would have killed you, and let her live.

34. And Balaam said to the Angel of Jehovah, I have sinned, for I did not know You were standing in the way against me. Now therefore, if it has been displeasing to Your eye, I will turn back.

35. And the Angel of Jehovah said to Balaam, Go with the men, but only the word that I speak to you, that you shall speak. So Balaam went with the rulers of Balak.

36. And when Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, which is in the territory at the Arnon, at the border of the territory.

37. And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not reach out to send for you, to summon you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not truly able to honor you?

38. And Balaam said to Balak, Behold, I have come to you. Now, am I able at all to say anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that I shall speak.

39. And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirjath Huzoth.

40. And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and he sent some to Balaam and to the rulers who were with him.

41. And it was the next day, that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high places of Baal, that from there he might observe the extent of the people.

## Numbers 23

1. And Balaam said to Balak, Build seven altars for me here, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.

2. And Balak did as Balaam had spoken, and Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar.

3. And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps Jehovah will come to meet me, and whatever He shows me I will declare to you. So he went to a barren height.

4. And God met Balaam, and he said to Him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered on each altar a bull and a ram.

5. And Jehovah put a word in Balaams mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.

6. And he returned to him, and lo, he was standing by his burnt offering, he and all the rulers of Moab.

7. And he took up his parable and said: Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram, from the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse Jacob for me; and come, denounce Israel!

8. How shall I curse whom the Mighty God has not cursed? And how shall I denounce whom Jehovah has not denounced?

9. For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him. Behold, a people dwelling alone, not being reckoned among the nations.

10. Who can count the dust of Jacob, or number one-fourth of Israel? Let my soul die the death of the righteous, and let my end be like his!

11. And Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and lo, you have blessed them to be adored!

12. And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak what Jehovah has put in my mouth?

13. And Balak said to him, Please come with me to another place from which you can see them; you shall see only the extremity of them, and shall not see them all; curse them for me from there.

14. And he brought him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.

15. And he said to Balak, Stand here by your burnt offering while I meet over there.

16. And Jehovah met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.

17. And he came to him, and lo, he was standing by his burnt offering, and the rulers of Moab were with him. And Balak said to him, What has Jehovah spoken?

18. And he took up his parable and said: Rise up, Balak, and hear! Listen to me, son of Zippor!

19. The Mighty God is not a man, that He should lie, nor a son of man, that He should be sorry. Has He said, and shall He not do it? Or has He spoken, and shall He not make it good?

20. Behold, I have been chosen to bless; He has blessed, and I cannot reverse it.

21. He has not observed trouble in Jacob, nor has He seen toil in Israel. Jehovah his God is with him, and the shout of a King is among them.

22. The Mighty God who brings them out of Egypt is like the lofty horns of an oryx.

23. For there is no omen against Jacob, nor any divination against Israel. It now must be said of Jacob and of Israel, Oh, what the Mighty God has done!

24. Behold, the people rise like a lioness, and lifts itself up like a lion; it shall not lie down until it devours the prey, and drinks the blood of the slain.

25. And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all!

26. And Balaam answered and said to Balak, Did I not speak to you, saying, All that Jehovah speaks, that I must do?

27. And Balak said to Balaam, Please come, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will be agreeable in Gods eyes for you to curse them for me from there.

28. So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down facing the wilderness.

29. And Balaam said to Balak, Build for me here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.

30. And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on every altar.

## Numbers 24

1. Now when Balaam saw that it was good in the eyes of Jehovah to bless Israel, he did not go as at other times, to encounter an omen of divination, but he set his face toward the wilderness.

2. And Balaam raised his eyes, and saw Israel encamped according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him.

3. And he took up his parable and said: The utterance of Balaam the son of Beor, the utterance of the man whose eyes are opened,

4. the utterance of him who hears the Words of the Mighty God, who sees the vision of the Almighty, who falls down, with open eyes:

5. How delightful are your tents, O Jacob! Your dwellings, O Israel!

6. Like valleys that have been stretched out, like gardens by a river, like aloes planted by Jehovah, like cedars beside the waters.

7. He makes water flow from his buckets, and his seed in many waters, his king is higher than Agag, and his kingdom is exalted.

8. The Mighty God is bringing him out of Egypt; he has lofty horns like an oryx; he shall consume the nations, his enemies; he shall break their bones and pierce them with his arrows.

9. He has crouched, he has lain down as a lion, and as a lioness; who shall arouse him? Blessed is he who blesses you, and cursed is he who curses you.

10. And Balaks anger burned against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, I summoned you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times!

11. Now therefore, flee to your place. I had thought to honor you with great honor, but behold, Jehovah has kept you back from honor.

12. So Balaam said to Balak, Did I not also speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying,

13. If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the mouth of Jehovah, to do good or bad of my own heart; but what Jehovah speaks, that I will speak?

14. And now, behold, I am going to my people. Come, I will advise you what this people will do to your people in the latter days.

15. And he took up his parable and said, The utterance of Balaam the son of Beor, and the utterance of the man whose eyes are opened;

16. the utterance of him who hears the words of the Mighty God, and has the knowledge of the Most High, who sees the vision of the Almighty, who falls down, with open eyes:

17. I see Him, but not now; I behold Him, but not near; a Star shall come out of Jacob; a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shatter the extremities of Moab, and destroy all the seats of the sons of Seth.

18. And Edom shall be a possession; Seir also, his enemies, shall be a possession; and Israel shall do mightily.

19. Out of Jacob shall be One who has dominion, and has destroyed the remnants of the city.

20. Then he looked on Amalek, and he took up his parable and said: Amalek was first among the nations, but his end shall be everlasting destruction.

21. And he looked on the Kenites, and he took up his parable and said: Firm is your dwelling place, and your nest is set in the rock;

22. nevertheless the Kenites shall be burned up, until Asshur carries you away captive.

23. And he took up his parable and said: Alas! Who shall live when the Mighty God brings this to pass?

24. But ships shall come from the coasts of Kittim, and they shall afflict Asshur and afflict Eber, unto everlasting destruction.

25. And Balaam arose and departed and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.

## Numbers 25

1. And Israel remained in Shittim, and the people began to commit harlotry with the daughters of Moab.

2. And they invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods.

3. And Israel was joined to Baal-peor, and the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel.

4. And Jehovah said to Moses, Take all the heads of the people and hang them before Jehovah in broad daylight, that the burning anger of Jehovah may be turned away from Israel.

5. And Moses said to the judges of Israel, Every one of you kill his men who were joined to Baal-peor.

6. And behold, one of the sons of Israel came and brought in to his brethren a Midianite woman before the eyes of Moses and before the eyes of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting.

7. And when Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation and took a javelin in his hand;

8. and he went after the man of Israel into the tent and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman, through her belly. Thus the plague was stopped from the children of Israel.

9. And those who died in the plague were twenty-four thousand.

10. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:

11. Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned back My wrath from the children of Israel, because he was zealous with My zeal among them, so that I did not consume the children of Israel in My jealousy.

12. Therefore say, Behold, I give to him My covenant of peace;

13. and it shall be to him and his seed after him a covenant of a perpetual priesthood, because he was zealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.

14. Now the name of the man of Israel who was killed, who was killed with the Midianite woman, was Zimri the son of Salu, a ruler of a fathers house of the Simeonites.

15. And the name of the Midianite woman who was killed was Cozbi the daughter of Zur; he was head of a tribe of a fathers house in Midian.

16. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:

17. Strike to harass the Midianites;

18. for they harassed you with their schemes by which they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a ruler of Midian, their sister, who was killed in the day of the plague because of the matter of Peor.

## Numbers 26

1. And it came to pass, after the plague, that Jehovah spoke to Moses and Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying:

2. Take a head count of the congregation of the sons of Israel from twenty years old and above, by their fathers houses, all who are able to go to war in Israel.

3. And Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho, saying:

4. Count from twenty years old and above, as Jehovah has commanded Moses and the sons of Israel who came out of the land of Egypt.

5. Reuben was the firstborn of Israel. The sons of Reuben: of Hanoch, the family of the Hanochites; of Pallu, the family of the Palluites;

6. of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites; of Carmi, the family of the Carmites.

7. These are the families of the Reubenites: those who were numbered of them were forty-three thousand seven hundred and thirty.

8. And the son of Pallu was Eliab.

9. The sons of Eliab were Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. These are the Dathan and Abiram, called out of the congregation, who struggled against Moses and Aaron in the company of Korah, to struggle against Jehovah;

10. and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up together with Korah when that company died, when the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men; and they became a sign.

11. However the sons of Korah did not die.

12. The sons of Simeon according to their families: of Nemuel, the family of the Nemuelites; of Jamin, the family of the Jaminites; of Jachin, the family of the Jachinites;

13. of Zerah, the family of the Zarhites; of Shaul, the family of the Shaulites.

14. These are the families of the Simeonites: twenty-two thousand two hundred.

15. The sons of Gad according to their families: of Zephon, the family of the Zephonites; of Haggi, the family of the Haggites; of Shuni, the family of the Shunites;

16. of Ozni, the family of the Oznites; of Eri, the family of the Erites;

17. of Arod, the family of the Arodites; of Areli, the family of the Arelites.

18. These are the families of the sons of Gad according to those who were numbered of them: forty thousand five hundred.

53. To these the land shall be divided as an inheritance, according to the number of names.

54. To the many you shall give a larger inheritance, and to the few you shall give a smaller inheritance. Each shall be given its inheritance at the mouth of those who were numbered of them.

55. But the land shall be divided by lot; they shall inherit according to the names of the tribes of their fathers.

56. By the mouth of the lot their inheritance shall be divided between the many and the few.

57. And these are those who were numbered of the Levites according to their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites; of Merari, the family of the Merarites.

60. To Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.

61. And Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire before Jehovah.

62. And those who were numbered of them were twenty-three thousand, every male from a month old and above; for they were not numbered among the other sons of Israel, because there was no inheritance given to them among the sons of Israel.

63. These are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the sons of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho.

64. But among these there was not a man of those who were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest when they numbered the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.

65. For Jehovah had said of them, They shall die the death in the wilderness. Thus there was not left a man of them, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.

## Numbers 27

1. Then came the daughters of Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, from the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and these were the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

2. And they stood before Moses, before Eleazar the priest, and before the leaders and all the congregation, at the door of the tent of meeting, saying:

3. Our father died in the wilderness; but he was not in the company of those who gathered together against Jehovah, in company with Korah, but he died in his own sin; and he had no sons.

4. Why should the name of our father be removed from among his family because he had no son? Give us a possession among our fathers brothers.

5. And Moses brought their case before Jehovah.

6. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:

7. The daughters of Zelophehad speak what is right. You shall assign to give them a possession of inheritance among their fathers brothers, and cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.

8. And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying: If a man dies and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.

9. If he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.

10. If he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his fathers brothers.

11. And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to the relative closest to him in his family, and he shall possess it. And it shall be to the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as Jehovah has commanded Moses.

12. And Jehovah said to Moses: Go up into this Mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel.

13. And when you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was gathered.

14. For in the wilderness of Zin, during the strife of the congregation, you rebelled against My mouth to sanctify Me at the waters before their eyes. (These are the waters of Meribah, at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)

15. And Moses spoke to Jehovah, saying:

16. Let Jehovah the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,

17. who shall go out before them and go in before them, who shall lead them out and bring them in, that the congregation of Jehovah not be like sheep which have no shepherd.

18. And Jehovah said to Moses: Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand upon him;

19. make him stand before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation, and commission him before their eyes.

20. And you shall ascribe some of your majesty upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.

21. And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire before Jehovah for him according to the judgment of the Urim. At his mouth they shall go out, and at his mouth they shall come in, he and all the children of Israel with him; all the congregation.

22. So Moses did as Jehovah commanded him. He took Joshua and made him stand before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation.

23. And he laid his hands on him and commissioned him, as Jehovah had commanded by the hand of Moses.

## Numbers 28

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Command the children of Israel, and say to them, My offering, My food for My offerings by fire as a soothing aroma unto Me, you shall take heed to offer to Me at their appointed times.

3. And you shall say to them, This is the offering by fire which you shall offer unto Jehovah: two male lambs of the first year that are whole, day by day, as a continual burnt offering.

4. The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, the other lamb you shall offer in the evening,

5. and one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering mixed with one-fourth of a hin of beaten oil.

6. It is the continual burnt offering which was ordained at Mount Sinai for a soothing aroma, an offering by fire unto Jehovah.

7. And its drink offering shall be one-fourth of a hin for each lamb; in a holy place you shall pour out the strong drink unto Jehovah as an offering.

8. The other lamb you shall offer in the evening; as the morning grain offering and its drink offering, you shall offer it as an offering by fire, a soothing aroma unto Jehovah.

9. And on the Sabbath day two lambs of the first year, that are whole, and two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with oil, with its drink offering;

10. this is the burnt offering for every Sabbath, besides the continual burnt offering with its drink offering.

11. At the beginnings of your months you shall present a burnt offering unto Jehovah: two young bulls, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year, that are whole;

12. three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with oil, for each bull; two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with oil, for the one ram;

13. and one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour, mixed with oil, as a grain offering for each lamb, as a burnt offering of a soothing aroma, an offering by fire unto Jehovah.

14. Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull, one-third of a hin for a ram, and one-fourth of a hin for a lamb; this is the burnt offering for each month throughout the months of the year.

15. And one kid of the goats as a sin offering unto Jehovah shall be offered, besides the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.

16. On the fourteenth day of the first month is the Passover of Jehovah.

17. And on the fifteenth day of this month is the feast; unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days.

18. On the first day you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no labor of work.

19. And you shall present an offering by fire as a burnt offering unto Jehovah: two young bulls, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year; ones that are whole.

20. Their grain offering shall be of fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah you shall offer for a bull, and two-tenths for a ram;

21. you shall offer one-tenth of an ephah for each of the seven lambs;

22. and one goat as a sin offering, to make atonement for you.

23. You shall offer these besides the burnt offering of the morning, the continual burnt offering.

24. In this manner you shall offer the food of the offering by fire daily for seven days, as a soothing aroma unto Jehovah; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.

25. And on the seventh day you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no labor of work.

26. And on the day of the firstfruits, when you bring a new grain offering unto Jehovah at your Feast of Weeks, you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no labor of work.

27. You shall present a burnt offering as a soothing aroma unto Jehovah: two young bulls, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year,

28. with their grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for each bull, two-tenths for the one ram,

29. and one-tenth for each of the seven lambs;

30. and one kid of the goats, to make atonement for you.

31. You shall offer them with their drink offerings, besides the continual burnt offering with its grain offering. They shall be ones that are whole.

## Numbers 29

1. And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no labor of work. It is a day of shouting with trumpet blasts to you.

2. You shall offer a burnt offering as a soothing aroma unto Jehovah: one young bull, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year, that are whole.

12. On the fifteenth day of the seventh month you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no labor of work, and you shall hold a feast unto Jehovah seven days.

26. On the fifth day nine bulls, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year, that are whole,

39. These you shall offer unto Jehovah at your appointed times (besides your vows and freewill offerings) as your burnt offerings and your grain offerings, as your drink offerings and your peace offerings.

40. Thus Moses said to the children of Israel, according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses.

## Numbers 30

1. And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded:

2. If a man vows a vow unto Jehovah, or swears an oath to bind his soul to a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.

3. If a woman vows a vow unto Jehovah, and has bound her soul to a bond while in her fathers house in her youth,

4. and her father has heard her vow and the bond by which she has bound her soul, and her father has remained silent, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond to which she has bound her soul shall stand.

5. But if her father has disallowed her on the day that he hears, then none of her vows nor her bonds by which she has bound her soul shall stand; and Jehovah will forgive her, because her father has disallowed her.

6. And if she belongs to a husband, when she has bound her soul with a vow or rash utterance of her lips,

7. and her husband has heard, and has kept silent to her on the day that he hears, then her vows have been confirmed, and her bonds by which she bound her soul shall stand.

8. But if her husband disallows her on the day that he hears it, he has made void her vow which she uttered with her lips, with which she bound her soul; and Jehovah will forgive her.

9. But any vow of a widow or a divorced woman, by which she has bound her soul, shall be confirmed against her.

10. If she has vowed in her husbands house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath,

11. and her husband has heard it, and kept silent to her and has not disallowed her, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond by which she has bound her soul has been confirmed.

12. But if her husband disallows, to void them on the day he hears them, then whatever proceeded from her lips concerning her vows or concerning the bond of her soul shall not stand; her husband has made them void; and Jehovah will forgive her.

13. Every vow and every binding oath to humble her soul, her husband may confirm it, or her husband may make it void.

14. But if her husband is silent and says nothing to her from day to day, then he has confirmed all her vows or all the bonds that are upon her; he has confirmed them, because he has remained silent to her on the day that he heard them.

15. And if he does disallow, to make them void after he has heard them, then he has taken on her guilt.

16. These are the statutes which Jehovah has commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, and between a father and his daughter in her youth in her fathers house.

## Numbers 31

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:

2. Execute vengeance on the Midianites for the children of Israel. Afterward you shall be gathered to your people.

3. And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves for war, and let them go against the Midianites to give vengeance from Jehovah upon Midian.

4. A thousand from each tribe of all the tribes of Israel you shall send to the war.

5. So there were assigned from the thousands of Israel one thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.

6. And Moses sent them to the war, one thousand from each tribe; he sent them to the war with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, with the holy vessels and the signal trumpets in his hand.

7. And they warred against the Midianites, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses, and they killed all the males.

8. And they killed the kings of Midian with the rest of those who were killed; Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. Balaam the son of Beor they also killed with the sword.

9. And the sons of Israel took the women of Midian captive, with their little ones, and took as spoils all their cattle, all their flocks, and all their wealth.

10. They also burned with fire all the cities where they dwelt, and all their fortifications.

11. And they took all the spoils and all the booty; of man and beast.

12. And they brought the captives, the booty, and the spoils to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho.

13. And Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the congregation, went to meet them outside the camp.

14. And Moses was angry with the officers of the army, with the commanders over thousands and commanders over hundreds, who had come from the battle.

15. And Moses said to them: Have you kept alive all the women and let them live?

16. Behold, these women caused the sons of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to trespass against Jehovah in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of Jehovah.

17. Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known a man by lying with a male.

18. But keep alive for yourselves all the female children who have not known a male by lying with him.

19. And encamp outside the camp seven days; whoever has killed any soul, and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day.

20. And purify every garment, everything made of skins, everything woven of goats hair, and everything made of wood.

21. And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which Jehovah has commanded Moses:

22. Only the gold, the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead,

23. everything that can pass through the fire, you shall put through the fire, and it shall be clean; and it shall be purified with the water of impurity. And all that cannot pass through the fire you shall put through water.

24. And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and be clean, and afterward you shall come into the camp.

25. Now Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:

26. Take a head count of the prey of the captives, of man and beast; you and Eleazar the priest and the chief fathers of the congregation;

27. and divide the booty between those who took part in the war who went out to battle, and all the congregation.

28. And levy a tribute unto Jehovah upon the men of war who went out to battle: one of every five hundred of the persons, the cattle, the donkeys, and the sheep;

29. take it from their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest as a heave offering unto Jehovah.

30. And from the children of Israels half you shall take one of every fifty, of man, from the cattle, the donkeys, and the sheep, from all the livestock; and give them to the Levites who keep charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah.

31. And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Jehovah had commanded Moses.

32. The booty remaining from the plunder, which the men of war had taken, was six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep,

33. seventy-two thousand cattle,

34. sixty-one thousand donkeys,

35. and thirty-two thousand souls of mankind in all, of women who had not known a male by lying with him.

36. And the half, the portion for those who had gone out to war, was in number three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep;

37. and the tribute unto Jehovah of the sheep was six hundred and seventy-five.

38. The cattle were thirty-six thousand, of which the tribute unto Jehovah was seventy-two.

39. The donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred, of which the tribute unto Jehovah was sixty-one.

40. The souls of mankind were sixteen thousand, of which the tribute unto Jehovah was thirty-two souls.

41. And Moses gave the tribute which was Jehovahs heave offering to Eleazar the priest, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.

42. And from the children of Israels half, which Moses divided from the men who went to war:

43. (Now the half belonging to the congregation was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep,

44. thirty-six thousand cattle,

45. thirty thousand five hundred donkeys,

46. and sixteen thousand souls of mankind.)

47. From the children of Israels half Moses took one of every fifty, from man and beast, and gave them to the Levites, who kept charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.

48. And the officers who were over thousands of the army, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, came near to Moses;

49. and they said to Moses, Your servants have taken a head count of the men of war who are under our hand, and not a man of us is missing.

50. Therefore we have brought an offering unto Jehovah, from what every man has found of articles of gold: armlets and bracelets and rings and earrings and ornaments, to make atonement for ourselves before Jehovah.

51. And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from them, all the crafted articles.

52. And all the gold of the offering which they offered unto Jehovah, from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.

53. (The men of war had taken spoils, every man for himself.)

54. And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting as a memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah.

## Numbers 32

1. Now the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had a very great number of livestock; and when they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, that behold the place was a place for livestock,

2. the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the leaders of the congregation, saying,

3. Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Shebam, Nebo, and Beon,

4. the land which Jehovah has struck before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock.

5. Therefore they said, If we have found favor in your eyes, let this land be given to your servants as a possession. Do not cause us to pass over the Jordan.

6. And Moses said to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben: Shall your brethren go to war while you sit here?

7. Now why will you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which Jehovah has given them?

8. Thus your fathers did when I sent them away from Kadesh Barnea to see the land.

9. For when they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, so that they did not go into the land which Jehovah had given them.

10. And the anger of Jehovah burned that day, and He swore, saying,

11. Surely none of the men who came up from Egypt, from twenty years old and above, shall see the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because they have not wholly followed Me,

12. except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun, for they have wholly followed Jehovah.

13. And the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the eyes of Jehovah was destroyed.

14. And behold, you have risen up in your fathers place, a brood of sinful men, to add still more to the burning anger of Jehovah against Israel.

15. For if you turn away from following Him, He will once again leave them in the wilderness, and you shall have destroyed all this people.

16. And they came near to him and said: We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones,

17. but we ourselves will be armed, ready to go before the children of Israel until we have brought them to their place; and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.

18. We will not return to our homes until every one of the sons of Israel has received his inheritance.

19. For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has fallen to us on this eastern side of the Jordan.

20. And Moses said to them: If you do this thing, if you arm yourselves before Jehovah for war,

21. and you all cross over the Jordan armed before Jehovah until He has driven out His enemies before Him,

22. and the land is subdued before Jehovah, then afterward you may return and be blameless before Jehovah and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before Jehovah.

23. But if you do not do so, behold, you have sinned against Jehovah; and recognize that your sin will find you out.

24. Build cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep, and do what has proceeded out of your mouth.

25. And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying: Your servants will do as my lord commands.

26. Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock shall be there in the cities of Gilead;

27. but your servants will cross over, every man armed for war, before Jehovah to battle, just as my lord says.

28. So Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel.

29. And Moses said to them: If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben cross over the Jordan with you, every man armed for battle before Jehovah, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead as a possession.

30. But if they do not cross over armed with you, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.

31. And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered, saying: As Jehovah has said to your servants, so we will do.

32. We will cross over armed before Jehovah into the land of Canaan, but the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us on this side of the Jordan.

33. And Moses gave to the sons of Gad, to the sons of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land with its cities within the borders, the cities of the surrounding land.

34. And the sons of Gad built Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer,

35. Atroth-shophan and Jazer and Jogbehah,

36. Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran, fortified cities, and folds for sheep.

37. And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon and Elealeh and Kirjathaim,

38. Nebo and Baal-meon (their names being changed) and Shibmah; and they gave other names to the cities which they built.

39. And the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and captured it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it.

40. And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he dwelt in it.

41. And Jair the son of Manasseh went and captured its small towns, and called them Havoth-jair.

42. And Nobah went and captured Kenath and its villages, and he called it Nobah, after his own name.

39. Aaron was one hundred and twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor.

50. And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho, saying,

51. Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When you have crossed the Jordan into the land of Canaan,

52. then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you, destroy all their carved figures, destroy all their images, and annihilate all their high places;

53. you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell in it, for I have given you the land to possess.

54. And you shall divide the land by lot as an inheritance among your families; to the larger you shall give a larger inheritance, and to the smaller you shall give a smaller inheritance; there everyones inheritance shall be whatever falls to him by lot. You shall inherit according to the tribes of your fathers.

55. But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land before you, then it shall be that those whom you let remain shall be thorns in your eyes and pricks in your sides, and they shall distress you in the land where you dwell.

56. Moreover it shall be that I will do to you as I had thought to do to them.

## Numbers 34

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Command the children of Israel, and say to them: When you come into the land of Canaan, this is the land that shall fall to you as an inheritance; the land of Canaan to its borders.

3. Your southern border shall be from the wilderness of Zin alongside Edom; and your southern border shall be eastward to the end of the Salt Sea;

4. your border shall turn from the southern side of the ascent of Akrabbim, continue to Zin, and be on the south of Kadesh Barnea; and it shall go on to Hazar Addar, and continue to Azmon;

5. the border shall turn from Azmon to the Brook of Egypt, and it shall end at the Sea.

6. As for the western border, you shall have the Great Sea for a border; this shall be your western border.

7. And this shall be your northern border: From the Great Sea you shall mark out to Mount Hor;

8. from Mount Hor you shall mark out to the entrance of Hamath; and the extremity of the border shall be toward Zedad;

9. the border shall proceed to Ziphron, and it shall end at Hazar Enan. This shall be your northern border.

10. You shall mark out your eastern border from Hazar Enan to Shepham;

11. the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain; the border shall go down and reach to the eastern side of the Sea of Chinnereth;

12. the border shall go down along the Jordan, and it shall end at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land with its surrounding borders.

13. And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying: This is the land which you shall inherit by lot, which Jehovah has commanded to give to the nine tribes and to the half-tribe.

14. For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and the half-tribe of Manasseh has received its inheritance.

15. The two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance on the other side of the Jordan, across from Jericho eastward, toward the sunrise.

16. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

17. These are the names of the men who shall divide the land among you: Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun.

18. And you shall take one leader of every tribe to divide the land for the inheritance.

19. These are the names of the men: from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;

20. from the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud;

21. from the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon;

22. the leader from the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of Jogli;

23. from the sons of Joseph: the leader from the tribe of the children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod,

24. and the leader from the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan;

25. the leader from the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach;

26. the leader from the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son of Azzan;

27. the leader from the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi;

28. and the leader from the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.

29. These are the ones Jehovah has commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.

## Numbers 35

1. And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, saying:

2. Command the children of Israel that they give the Levites cities to dwell in from the inheritance of their possessions, and you shall also give the Levites common land around the cities.

3. They shall have the cities to dwell in; and their common land shall be for their cattle, for their herds, and for all their animals.

4. The common land of the cities which you shall give the Levites shall extend from the wall of the city outward a thousand cubits all around.

5. And you shall measure outside the city on the east side two thousand cubits, on the south side two thousand cubits, on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits. The city shall be in the middle. This shall be to them as common land for the cities.

6. And among the cities which you shall give to the Levites you shall appoint six cities of refuge, to which a manslayer may flee. And to these you shall add forty-two cities.

7. So all the cities you shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight; these you shall give with their common lands.

8. And the cities which you shall give shall be from the possession of the children of Israel; from the larger tribe you shall give many, from the smaller you shall give few. Each shall give some of its cities to the Levites, according to the inheritance that each receives.

9. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,

10. Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,

11. then you shall appoint cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer who kills any soul accidentally may flee there.

12. They shall be cities of refuge for you from the kinsman avenger, that the manslayer may not die until he stands before the congregation in judgment.

13. And out of the cities which you give, you shall have six cities of refuge.

14. You shall appoint three cities on this side of the Jordan, and three cities you shall appoint in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.

15. These six cities shall be for refuge for the children of Israel, for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them, that anyone who kills a soul accidentally may flee there.

16. But if he strikes him with an implement of iron, so that he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be executed to death.

17. And if he strikes him with a stone in the hand, by which one could die, and he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be executed to death.

18. Or if he strikes him with a wooden implement in the hand, by which one could die, and he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be executed to death.

19. The kinsman avenger of blood himself shall put the murderer to death; when he meets him, he shall put him to death.

20. If he pushes him out of hatred, or while lying in wait has thrown something at him, so that he dies,

21. or in enmity he has struck him with his hand so that he dies, the one who struck him shall be executed to death. He is a murderer. The kinsman avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he meets him.

22. However, if he has pushed him suddenly without enmity, or has thrown anything at him without lying in wait,

23. or a stone, by which a man could die, which falls on him without seeing him, so that he dies, while he was not his enemy or seeking his harm;

24. then the congregation shall judge between the manslayer and the kinsman avenger of blood according to these judgments.

25. Thus the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the kinsman avenger of blood, and the congregation shall return him to the city of refuge where he had fled, and he shall remain there until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil.

26. But if the manslayer at any time goes outside the borders of the city of refuge where he fled,

27. and the kinsman avenger of blood finds him outside the borders of his city of refuge, and the kinsman avenger of blood kills the manslayer, he shall not be guilty of blood,

28. because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return to the land of his possession.

29. And these things shall be a statute of judgment to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

30. Whoever kills a soul, the murderer shall be put to death at the mouth of witnesses; but one witness shall not testify against a soul for him to die.

31. Moreover you shall take no ransom for the soul of a murderer who is guilty of death, but he shall be executed to death.

32. And you shall take no ransom for him to flee to his city of refuge, to return to dwell in the land until the death of the priest.

33. Thus you shall not pollute the land where you are; for blood pollutes the land. And no atonement can be made for the land, for the blood that is shed on it, except by the blood of him who sheds it.

34. Therefore do not defile the land which you inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell; for I, Jehovah, dwell among the children of Israel.

## Numbers 36

1. Now the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near and spoke before Moses and before the leaders, the chief fathers of the children of Israel.

2. And they said: Jehovah commanded my lord Moses to give the land as an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel, and my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.

3. Now if they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then their inheritance will be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and it will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry; so it will be taken from the lot of our inheritance.

4. And when the Jubilee of the children of Israel comes, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry; so their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.

5. And Moses commanded the children of Israel at the mouth of Jehovah, saying: What the tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks is right.

6. This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry whoever is good in their eyes, but they shall marry only within the family of the tribe of their father.

7. Thus the inheritance of the children of Israel shall not turn about from tribe to tribe; for every one of the children of Israel shall keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.

8. And every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be the wife of one of the family of her fathers tribe, so that the children of Israel each may possess the inheritance of his fathers.

9. Thus no inheritance shall turn about from one tribe to another tribe, but every tribe of the children of Israel shall cling to its own inheritance.

10. Thus, as Jehovah had commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad;

11. for Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to the sons of their fathers brothers.

12. They were married into the families of the children of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their fathers.

13. These are the commandments and the judgments which Jehovah commanded the children of Israel by the hand of Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho.
