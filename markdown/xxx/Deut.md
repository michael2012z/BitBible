# Deuteronomy

## Deuteronomy 1

1. These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side of the Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain opposite Suph, between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.

2. (It takes eleven days to get from Horeb by way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea.)

3. And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that Jehovah had given him commandment concerning them,

4. after he had struck Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who dwelt at Ashtaroth in Edrei.

5. On this side of the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this Law, saying,

6. Jehovah our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying: You have dwelt long enough at this mountain.

7. Turn and set out, and go to the mountains of the Amorites, to all the neighboring places in the plain, in the mountains and in the lowland, in the South and on the seacoast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the River Euphrates.

8. Behold, I have set the land before you; go in and possess the land which Jehovah has sworn to your fathers; to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; to give to them and their seed after them.

9. And I spoke to you at that time, saying: I alone am not able to bear you.

10. Jehovah your God has multiplied you, and here you are today, as the stars of the heavens in multitude.

11. May Jehovah the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times more than you are, and bless you as He has promised you!

12. How can I alone bear your burdens and your loads and your disputes?

13. Choose wise, understanding, and knowledgeable men from among your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.

14. And you answered me and said, The thing which you have spoken to us is good to do.

15. So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and knowledgeable men, and made them heads over you, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, rulers of tens, and officials for your tribes.

16. And I commanded your judges at that time, saying, Hear the cases between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother or the sojourner.

17. You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small as well as the great; you shall not be afraid of any mans presence, for the judgment is Gods. And any matter that is too hard for you, bring to me, and I will hear it.

18. And I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.

19. So we set out from Horeb, and went through all that great and dreadful wilderness which you have seen on the way to the mountains of the Amorites, as Jehovah our God had commanded us; and we came to Kadesh Barnea.

20. And I said to you, You have come to the mountains of the Amorites, which Jehovah our God is giving to us.

21. Behold, Jehovah your God has set the land before you; go up and possess it, as Jehovah the God of your fathers has spoken to you; do not fear or be dismayed.

22. And all of you came near to me and said, Let us send men before us, and let them search out the land for us, and bring back word to us of the way by which we should go up, and of the cities into which we shall come.

23. And the thing was good in my eyes; so I took twelve of your men, one man from each tribe.

24. And they turned and went up into the mountains, and came to the Valley of Eshcol, and explored it.

25. They also took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us; and they brought back word to us, saying, It is a good land which Jehovah our God is giving to us.

26. Nevertheless you would not go up, but rebelled against the mouth of Jehovah your God;

27. and you murmured in your tents, and said, Because Jehovah hates us, He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.

28. Where shall we go up? Our brethren have caused our hearts to melt, saying, The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to the heavens; moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.

29. Then I said to you, Do not be terrified, nor afraid of them.

30. Jehovah your God, who goes before you, He will fight for you, according to all that He did for you in Egypt before your eyes,

31. and in the wilderness where you have seen how Jehovah your God has carried you, as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went until you came to this place.

32. Yet, for all that, you did not believe Jehovah your God,

33. who went in the way before you to search out a place for you to encamp, to show you the way you should go, in the fire by night and in the cloud by day.

34. And Jehovah heard the sound of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,

35. Not one of these men of this evil generation shall see that good land which I have sworn to give to your fathers,

36. except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him and his children I am giving the land upon which he has walked, because he has wholly followed Jehovah.

37. Jehovah was also angry with me on account of you, saying, You also shall not go in there.

38. Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.

39. Moreover your little ones and your children, whom you say will be prey, who today have no knowledge of good and evil, they shall go in there; to them I will give it, and they shall possess it.

40. But as for you, turn and set out into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.

41. Then you answered and said to me, We have sinned against Jehovah; we will go up and fight, just as Jehovah our God commanded us. And each of you girded on his weapons of war, and were ready to go up into the mountain.

42. And Jehovah said to me, Say to them, Do not go up nor fight, for I am not among you; lest you be struck down before your enemies.

43. So I spoke to you; yet you would not listen, but rebelled against the mouth of Jehovah, and presumptuously went up into the mountain.

44. And the Amorites who dwelt in that mountain came out against you and chased you as bees do, and shattered you in pieces from Seir to Hormah.

45. And you returned and wept before Jehovah, but Jehovah would not listen to your voice nor give ear to you.

46. So you remained in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained there.

## Deuteronomy 2

1. Then we turned and set out into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea, as Jehovah had spoken to me, and we circled around Mount Seir many days.

2. And Jehovah spoke to me, saying:

3. You have circled around this mountain long enough; turn northward.

4. And command the people, saying, You are about to pass through the territory of your brethren, the sons of Esau, who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. Therefore be very much on guard.

5. Do not strive with them, for I am not giving you any of their land, no, not even one treading place for the souls of your feet, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession.

6. You shall buy food from them with money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water from them with money, that you may drink.

7. For Jehovah your God has blessed you in all the works of your hands. He has known your walking through this great wilderness. These forty years Jehovah your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.

8. And when we passed beyond our brethren, the sons of Esau who dwell in Seir, away from the way of the plain, away from Elath and Ezion Geber, we turned and passed by way of the wilderness of Moab.

9. And Jehovah said to me, Do not show hostility to Moab, nor contend with them in battle, for I will not give you any of their land as a possession, because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot as a possession.

10. (The Emim had dwelt there in times past, a people as great and numerous and tall as the Anakim.

11. They were also regarded as giants, like the Anakim, but the Moabites call them Emim.

12. The Horites formerly dwelt in Seir, but the sons of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their place, just as Israel has done to the land of their possession which Jehovah has given them.)

13. Now rise up and cross over the valley of the Zered. So we crossed over the valley of the Zered.

14. And the time that passed from Kadesh Barnea until we had crossed over the valley of the Zered was thirty-eight years, for all the generation of the men of war to be finished off from the midst of the camp, as Jehovah had sworn to them.

15. For indeed the hand of Jehovah was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp until they were consumed.

16. So it was, when all the men of war had completely perished from among the people,

17. that Jehovah spoke to me, saying:

18. This day you are crossing over at Ar, the border of Moab.

19. And when you come near the children of Ammon, do not show hostility to them nor contend with them, for I will not give you any of the land of the sons of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot as a possession.

20. (That was also regarded as a land of giants; giants formerly dwelt there. But the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,

21. a people as great and numerous and tall as the Anakim. But Jehovah destroyed them before them, and they dispossessed them and dwelt in their place,

22. just as He had done for the sons of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them. They dispossessed them and dwelt in their place, even to this day.

23. And the Avim, who dwelt in villages as far as Gaza; the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and dwelt in their place.)

24. Rise up, set out, and cross over the river Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to possess it, and engage him in battle.

25. This day I will begin to put the dread and terror of you upon the faces of the peoples under all the heavens, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble and writhe because of you.

26. And I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,

27. Let me pass through your land; I will proceed directly on the way; I will neither turn aside to the right nor to the left.

28. You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink; only let me pass through on foot,

29. just as the sons of Esau who dwell in Seir and the Moabites who dwell in Ar did for me, until I cross the Jordan to the land which Jehovah our God is giving to us.

30. But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass through; for Jehovah your God had made his spirit stubborn and hardened his heart, that He might deliver him into your hand, as it is this day.

31. And Jehovah said to me, Behold, I have begun to set Sihon and his land before you. Begin to possess it, that you may inherit his land.

32. And Sihon and all his people came out against us to do battle at Jahaz.

33. And Jehovah our God delivered him up before us; and we struck him, his sons, and all his people.

34. We took all his cities at that time, and we utterly destroyed the men, women, and little ones of every city; we left none remaining.

35. We took only the livestock as plunder for ourselves, with the spoils of the cities which we took.

36. From Aroer, which is beside the River Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, as far as Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us; Jehovah our God delivered up all before us.

37. Only you did not go near the land of the children of Ammon; anywhere along the River Jabbok, nor to the cities of the mountains, nor wherever Jehovah our God had forbidden us.

## Deuteronomy 3

1. Then we turned and went up the way to Bashan; and Og king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.

2. And Jehovah said to me, Do not fear him, for I have delivered him and all his people and his land into your hand; you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.

3. So Jehovah our God also delivered into our hands Og king of Bashan, with all his people, and we struck him until he had no survivors remaining.

4. And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we did not take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

5. All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides a great many rural towns.

6. And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children of every city.

7. And all the livestock and the spoils of the cities we plundered for ourselves.

8. And at that time we took the land from the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the River Arnon to Mount Hermon

9. (the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir),

10. all the cities of the plain, all Gilead, and all Bashan, as far as Salcah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

11. For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the giants. Behold, his bedstead was an iron bedstead (Is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon.): Nine cubits its length and four cubits its width, according to the cubit of a man.

12. And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer by the River Arnon, and half the mountains of Gilead and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites.

13. The rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (All the region of Argob, with all Bashan, was called the land of the giants.

14. Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and called Bashan after his own name, Havoth Jair, to this day.)

15. I also gave Gilead to Machir.

16. And to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave from Gilead as far as the River Arnon, the middle of the river as the border, as far as the River Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;

17. the plain also, with the Jordan as the border, from Chinnereth as far as the east side of the sea of the plain (the Salt Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah.

18. Then I commanded you at that time, saying: Jehovah your God has given you this land to possess. All your men of war shall cross over armed before your brethren, the children of Israel.

19. But your wives, your little ones, and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock) shall remain in your cities which I have given you,

20. until Jehovah has given rest to your brethren as He has to you, and they also possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving to them beyond the Jordan. Then each of you shall return to his possession which I have given to you.

21. And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen all that Jehovah your God has done to these two kings; so will Jehovah do to all the kingdoms through which you pass.

22. You shall not fear them, for Jehovah your God Himself fights for you.

23. Then I besought Jehovah at that time, saying:

24. O Lord Jehovah, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your mighty hand, for what god is there in the heavens or on earth who can do according to Your works and Your might?

25. I pray, let me cross over and see the good land beyond the Jordan, those pleasant mountains, and Lebanon.

26. But Jehovah was angry with me on your account, and would not listen to me. And Jehovah said to me: Enough from you! Speak no more to Me of this matter.

27. Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes toward the west, the north, the south, and the east; behold it with your eyes, for you shall not cross over this Jordan.

28. But commission Joshua, and encourage him and make him bold; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.

29. So we remained in the valley across from Beth Peor.

## Deuteronomy 4

1. Now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments which I am teaching you to do, that you may live, and go in and possess the land which Jehovah the God of your fathers is giving to you.

2. You shall not add to the Word which I am commanding you, nor take away from it, to keep the commandments of Jehovah your God which I am commanding you.

3. Your eyes have seen what Jehovah did at Baal-Peor; for Jehovah your God has destroyed from among you all the men who followed Baal-peor.

4. But you who held fast to Jehovah your God are alive today, every one of you.

5. Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, just as Jehovah my God has commanded me, for you to do them in the midst of the land which you are going in to possess.

6. Keep and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the eyes of the peoples who will hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.

7. For what great nation is there whose God is near to it, as Jehovah our God is to us, in all that we call upon Him?

8. And what great nation is there that has such statutes and righteous judgments as are in all this Law which I am setting before you this day?

9. Only take heed to yourself and keep your soul diligently, that you not forget the things your eyes have seen, and that they not depart from your heart all the days of your life; and teach them to your children and your grandchildren.

10. The day you stood before Jehovah your God in Horeb, Jehovah said to me, Gather the people to Me, and I will make them hear My Words, that they may learn to fear Me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.

11. And you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire to the midst of the heavens, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.

12. And Jehovah spoke to you out of the midst of the fire. You heard the sound of the words, but saw no form; you only heard a voice.

13. Thus He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to do, the Ten Commandments; and He wrote them on two tablets of stone.

14. And Jehovah commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, for you to do them in the land which you are crossing over to possess.

15. Take diligent heed to your souls, for you saw no form on the day Jehovah spoke to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire,

16. that you not act corruptly and make for yourselves a carved image in the form of any statue: male or female figures,

17. the figure of any beast on the earth or the figure of any bird that flies in the heavens,

18. the figure of anything that creeps on the ground or the figure of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth.

19. And take heed, when you lift up your eyes to the heavens, and you see the sun, the moon, and the stars, all the host of the heavens, that you not be driven to bow down to them and serve them, which Jehovah your God has allotted to all the peoples under the heavens.

20. But Jehovah has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be His people, an inheritance, as you are this day.

21. Furthermore Jehovah was angry with me on account of your words, and swore that I would not cross over the Jordan, and that I would not enter the good land which Jehovah your God is giving to you as an inheritance.

22. But I shall die in this land, I shall not cross over the Jordan; but you shall cross over and possess that good land.

23. Take heed to yourselves, that you not forget the covenant of Jehovah your God which He has made with you, and make for yourselves a carved image in the form of anything which Jehovah your God has forbidden you.

24. For Jehovah your God is a consuming fire, a jealous Mighty God.

25. When you beget children and grandchildren and have been in the land a long time, and have acted corruptly and made a carved image in the form of anything, and have done evil in the eyes of Jehovah your God to provoke Him to anger,

26. I call the heavens and the earth to witness against you this day, that you shall quickly die and perish from off the land which you are crossing over the Jordan to possess; you shall not prolong your days in it, but shall be destroyed to annihilation.

27. And Jehovah will scatter you among the peoples, and you shall be left few in number among the nations where Jehovah will drive you.

28. And there you will serve gods, the work of mens hands, wood and stone, which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell.

29. But from there you will seek Jehovah your God, and you shall find Him if you seek Him with all your heart and with all your soul.

30. When you are in distress, and all these things have come upon you in the latter days; then when you have returned unto Jehovah your God and have obeyed His voice

31. (for Jehovah your God is a merciful Mighty God), He will not forsake you nor destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which He has sworn unto them.

32. For ask now concerning the former days, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and ask from one end of the heavens to the other, whether any great thing like this has happened, or anything like it has been heard.

33. Has any people ever heard the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and lived?

34. Or has God ever tried to go and take for Himself a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Jehovah your God has done for you in Egypt before your eyes?

35. To you it has been shown, that you might know that Jehovah Himself is God; there is no one else besides Him.

36. Out of the heavens He has caused you to hear His voice, to instruct you; on earth He has shown you His great fire, and you have heard His Words out of the midst of the fire.

37. And because He has loved your fathers, therefore He chose their seed after them and brought you out of Egypt before Him with His mighty power,

38. to drive out before you nations greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land as an inheritance, as it is this day.

39. Therefore know this day, and consider it in your heart, that Jehovah Himself is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath; there is no other.

40. You shall therefore keep His statutes and His commandments which I am commanding you today, that it may be well with you and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which Jehovah your God is giving you for all time.

41. Then Moses set apart three cities on this side of the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun,

42. that the manslayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unintentionally, without having hated him in time past, and that by fleeing to one of these cities he might live:

43. Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau for the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.

44. Now this is the Law which Moses set before the children of Israel.

45. These are the testimonies, the statutes, and the judgments which Moses spoke to the children of Israel after they came out of Egypt,

46. across the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel struck when they came out of Egypt.

47. And they took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were across the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun,

48. from Aroer, which is next to the River Arnon, even to Mount Sion (that is, Hermon),

49. and all the plain on the east side of the Jordan as far as the sea of the plain, below the slopes of Pisgah.

## Deuteronomy 5

1. And Moses summoned all Israel, and said to them: Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I am speaking in your ears today, that you may learn them and take heed to do them.

2. Jehovah our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.

3. Jehovah did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, all those of us who are alive here today.

4. Jehovah talked with you face to face on the mountain from the midst of the fire.

5. I stood between Jehovah and you at that time, to declare to you the Word of Jehovah (for you were afraid of the presence of the fire, and you did not go up the mountain), saying:

6. I am Jehovah your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

7. You shall have no other gods before Me.

8. You shall not make for yourself a carved image; any likeness of anything in the heavens above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth;

9. you shall not bow down to them nor serve them; for I, Jehovah your God, am a jealous Mighty God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me,

10. but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.

11. You shall not take the name of Jehovah your God in vain, for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain.

12. Keep the Sabbath day, to be holy, as Jehovah your God has commanded you.

13. Six days you shall labor and do all your work,

14. but the seventh day is the Sabbath of Jehovah your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your cattle, nor your sojourner who is within your gates, that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.

15. And remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah your God brought you out from there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm; therefore Jehovah your God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.

16. Honor your father and your mother, as Jehovah your God has commanded you, that your days may be prolonged, and that it may be well with you in the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you.

17. You shall not murder.

18. You shall not commit adultery.

19. You shall not steal.

20. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

21. You shall not desire your neighbors wife; and you shall not covet your neighbors house, his field, his male servant, his female servant, his ox, his donkey, or anything that is your neighbors.

22. These words Jehovah has spoken to all your assembly, on the mountain from the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, with a loud voice; and He has added no more. And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me.

23. And so it was, when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, that you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders.

24. And you said, Behold, Jehovah our God has shown us His glory and His greatness, and we have heard His voice from the midst of the fire. We have seen this day that God speaks with man, yet he lives.

25. Now therefore, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of Jehovah our God anymore, then we shall die!

26. For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?

27. You go near and hear all that Jehovah our God shall say, and you speak to us all that Jehovah our God shall speak to you; and we will hear and do it.

28. And Jehovah heard the voice of your words when you spoke to me, and Jehovah said to me: I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken to you. They have done well in all that they have spoken.

29. Oh, that this heart of theirs would be fully yielded, to fear Me and to keep all My commandments at all times, that it might be well with them and with their children forever!

30. Go and say to them, Return to your tents.

31. But as for you, stand here by Me, and I will speak to you all the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land which I am giving them to possess.

32. Therefore, take heed to do as Jehovah your God has commanded you; do not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.

33. You shall walk in all the ways which Jehovah your God has commanded you, that you may live and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess.

## Deuteronomy 6

1. Now these are the commandments, the statutes and judgments which Jehovah your God has commanded to teach you, to do them in the land which you are crossing over to possess,

2. that you may fear Jehovah your God, to keep all His statutes and His commandments which I am commanding you, you and your sons and your grandsons, all the days of your life, and that your days may be prolonged.

3. Therefore hear, O Israel, and take heed to do it, that it may be well with you, and that you may multiply greatly as Jehovah the God of your fathers has promised you; a land flowing with milk and honey.

4. Hear, O Israel: Jehovah our God, Jehovah is one.

5. And you shall love Jehovah your God with all your heart, with all your soul, exceedingly in every way.

6. And these Words which I am commanding you today shall be in your heart.

7. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.

8. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.

9. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.

10. And it shall be, when Jehovah your God shall have brought you into the land of which He has sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give you great and good cities which you have not built,

11. houses full of all good things, which you have not filled, hewn-out wells which you have not dug, vineyards and olive trees which you have not planted; when you have eaten and are full;

12. then be on guard that you not forget Jehovah who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

13. You shall fear Jehovah your God and serve Him, and swear by His name.

14. You shall not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples who are all around you

15. (for Jehovah your God is a jealous Mighty God among you), lest the anger of Jehovah your God burn against you and destroy you from off the face of the earth.

16. You shall not tempt Jehovah your God as you tempted Him in Massah.

17. You shall take heed to keep the commandments of Jehovah your God, His testimonies, and His statutes which He has commanded you.

18. And you shall do what is right and good in the eyes of Jehovah, that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess the good land of which Jehovah has sworn to your fathers,

19. to cast out all your enemies before you, as Jehovah has spoken.

20. When your son asks you in the future, saying, What are the testimonies, the statutes, and the judgments which Jehovah our God has commanded you?

21. then you shall say to your son: We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, and Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;

22. and Jehovah gave signs and wonders before our eyes, great and severe, against Egypt, Pharaoh, and all his house.

23. And He brought us out from there, that He might bring us in, to give us the land of which He had sworn to our fathers.

24. And Jehovah commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Jehovah our God, for our good always, to preserve us alive, as it is this day.

25. And it shall be righteousness for us if we take heed to do all these commandments before Jehovah our God, as He has commanded us.

## Deuteronomy 7

1. When Jehovah your God brings you into the land which you are going in to possess, and has cast out many nations before you, the Hittites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than you,

2. and when Jehovah your God has delivered them over to you, you shall strike them and destroy to exterminate them. You shall make no covenant with them nor show mercy unto them.

3. Nor shall you make marriages with them. You shall not give your daughter to their son, nor take their daughter for your son.

4. For they will turn your sons away from following Me, to serve other gods; and the anger of Jehovah will burn against you and quickly destroy you.

5. But thus you shall deal with them: you shall break down their altars, and shatter their pillars, and chop down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.

6. For you are a holy people unto Jehovah your God; Jehovah your God has chosen you to be a people for Himself, a special treasure out of all the peoples upon the face of the earth.

7. Jehovah did not set His love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any other people, for you were the least of all peoples;

8. but because Jehovah loves you, and to keep the oath which He has sworn to your fathers, Jehovah has brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

9. Therefore know that Jehovah your God, He is God, the faithful Mighty God who keeps covenant and mercy for a thousand generations with those who love Him and keep His commandments;

10. and He repays those who hate Him, to their face, to destroy them. He will not be slack with him who hates Him; He will repay him to his face.

11. Therefore you shall keep the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments which I am commanding you today, to do them.

12. Then it shall come to pass, because you obey these judgments, and keep and do them, that Jehovah your God will keep with you the covenant and the mercy which He has sworn to your fathers.

13. And He will love you and bless you and multiply you; He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your land, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the offspring of your cattle and the increase of your flock, in the land of which He has sworn to your fathers to give you.

14. You shall be blessed above all peoples; there shall not be sterility or barrenness among you or among your livestock.

15. And Jehovah will take away from you all sickness, and will afflict you with none of the terrible diseases of Egypt which you have known, but will lay them on all those who hate you.

16. And you shall destroy all the peoples whom Jehovah your God is delivering over to you; your eye shall have no pity on them; nor shall you serve their gods, for that would be a snare to you.

17. If you should think in your heart, These nations are greater than I; how can I dispossess them?

18. you shall not be afraid of them, but you shall call to mind to remember what Jehovah your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt:

19. the great trials which your eyes have seen, the signs and the wonders, the mighty hand and the outstretched arm, by which Jehovah your God has brought you out. Thus shall Jehovah your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.

20. Moreover Jehovah your God will send the hornet among them, for those who are left, who hide themselves from your face, to perish.

21. You shall not be terrified of them; for Jehovah your God, the great and awesome Mighty God, is among you.

22. And Jehovah your God will clear away those nations before you little by little; you shall not prevail to destroy them all at once, lest the beasts of the field become too numerous for you.

23. But Jehovah your God will deliver them over to you, and will defeat them with great confusion to annihilate them.

24. And He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall destroy their name from under the heavens; no one shall be able to stand against you until you have destroyed them.

25. You shall burn the graven images of their gods with fire; you shall not covet the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it for yourselves, lest you be snared by it; for it is an abomination to Jehovah your God.

26. Nor shall you bring an abomination into your house, lest you be utterly destroyed like it. You shall detest it unto abomination and loathe it unto abhorrence, for it is a prohibited thing.

## Deuteronomy 8

1. Every commandment which I am commanding you today you shall take heed to do, that you may live and multiply, and go in and possess the land of which Jehovah has sworn to your fathers.

2. And you shall remember that Jehovah your God has led you all the way these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you and test you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not.

3. And He humbled you, allowed you to hunger, and fed you with manna which you had not known nor had your fathers known, to make you know that man does not live by bread alone; but man lives by every Word that proceeds from the mouth of Jehovah.

4. Your garments did not wear out on you, nor did your foot swell these forty years.

5. You have come to know in your heart that as a man chastens his son, so Jehovah your God chastens you.

6. Therefore you shall keep the commandments of Jehovah your God, to walk in His ways and to fear Him.

7. For Jehovah your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, that flow out of valleys and hills;

8. a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey;

9. a land in which you will eat bread without scarcity, in which you shall lack nothing; a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills you can dig copper.

10. When you have eaten and been filled, then you shall bless Jehovah your God for the good land which He has given you.

11. Beware that you do not forget Jehovah your God by not keeping His commandments, His judgments, and His statutes which I am commanding you today,

12. lest, when you have eaten and been filled, and have built beautiful houses and dwelt in them;

13. and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold are multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied;

14. when your heart is lifted up, and you forget Jehovah your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;

15. who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, with the fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty land with no water; who has brought water for you out of the rock of flint;

16. who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers had not known, to humble you and to test you, to do you good in the end;

17. you say in your heart, My power and the might of my hand have acquired me this wealth.

18. But you shall remember Jehovah your God, for it is He who gives you power to acquire wealth, that He may establish His covenant which He has sworn to your fathers, as it is this day.

19. And it shall be, if you cease caring, to forget Jehovah your God, and have walked after other gods, and have served them and bowed down to them, I testify against you this day that you shall perish to extermination.

20. As the nations which Jehovah is destroying before you, so you shall perish, because you would not obey the voice of Jehovah your God.

## Deuteronomy 9

1. Hear, O Israel: You are crossing over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to the heavens,

2. a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you have known, and of whom you have heard it said, Who can stand before the sons of Anak?

3. Therefore understand today that Jehovah your God is He who goes over before you as a consuming fire. He will destroy them and bring them down before you; thus you shall dispossess them and destroy them quickly, as Jehovah has spoken to you.

4. Do not think in your heart, after Jehovah your God has cast them out before you, saying, Because of my righteousness Jehovah has brought me in to possess this land; but it is because of the wickedness of these nations that Jehovah is driving them out before you.

5. It is not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart that you are going in to possess their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations that Jehovah your God is driving them out before you, and that He may fulfill the word which Jehovah has sworn to your fathers; to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

6. Therefore understand that Jehovah your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness, for you are a stiff-necked people.

7. Remember; do not forget how you provoked Jehovah your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that you departed from the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against Jehovah.

8. Also in Horeb you provoked Jehovah to wrath, so that Jehovah was angry with you to have destroyed you.

9. When I went up into the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant which Jehovah had made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water.

10. And Jehovah gave me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of God, and on them were all the words which Jehovah had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.

11. And it came to pass, at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Jehovah had given me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant.

12. And Jehovah said to me, Arise, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have acted corruptly; they have quickly turned aside from the way which I have commanded them; they have made themselves a molten image.

13. Furthermore Jehovah spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people.

14. Let Me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under the heavens; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.

15. So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire; and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.

16. And I looked, and behold, you had sinned against Jehovah your God, and had made for yourselves a molten calf! You had turned aside quickly from the way which Jehovah had commanded you.

17. And I took the two tablets and threw them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes.

18. And I fell down before Jehovah, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you had sinned in doing evil in the eyes of Jehovah, to provoke Him to anger.

19. For I was afraid of the anger and fury with which Jehovah had been angry with you, to destroy you. But Jehovah gave heed to me at that time also.

20. And Jehovah was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him; and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.

21. And I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed and ground it thoroughly, until it was as fine as dust; and I threw its dust into the brook that was coming down from the mountain.

22. Also at Taberah and Massah and Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked Jehovah to wrath.

23. Likewise, when Jehovah sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you, then you rebelled against the mouth of Jehovah your God, and you did not believe Him nor obey His voice.

24. You have been rebellious against Jehovah from the day that I knew you.

25. Thus I prostrated myself before Jehovah; forty days and forty nights I kept prostrating myself, because Jehovah had thought to annihilate you.

26. Therefore I prayed to Jehovah, and said: O Lord Jehovah, do not destroy Your people and Your inheritance whom You have redeemed through Your greatness, whom You have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.

27. Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not look on the stubbornness of this people, or on their wickedness or their sin,

28. lest the land from which You have brought us should say, Because Jehovah was not able to bring them to the land which He promised them, and because He hated them, He has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.

29. Yet they are Your people and Your inheritance, whom You have brought out by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm.

## Deuteronomy 10

1. At that time Jehovah said to me, Hew for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and come up to Me on the mountain and make yourself an ark of wood.

2. And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you have broken; and you shall put them in the ark.

3. And I made an ark of acacia wood, hewed two tablets of stone like the first, and went up into the mountain, having the two tablets in my hand.

4. And He wrote on the tablets according to the first writing, the Ten Commandments, which Jehovah had spoken to you in the mountain from the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly; and Jehovah gave them to me.

5. And I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and there they are, as Jehovah had commanded me.

6. (Now the children of Israel journeyed from the wells of the sons of Jaakan to Moserah, where Aaron died, and where he was buried; and Eleazar his son served as priest in his place.

7. From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of rivers of water.

8. At that time Jehovah had separated the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, to stand before Jehovah to serve Him and to bless in His name, to this day.

9. Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; Jehovah is his inheritance, just as Jehovah your God has spoken to him.)

10. And, as at the first time, I stayed in the mountain forty days and forty nights; Jehovah also had given heed to me at that time, and Jehovah had consented to not destroy you.

11. And Jehovah said to me, Arise, proceed on your journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land which I have sworn to their fathers to give to them.

12. And now, Israel, what is Jehovah your God asking of you, but to fear Jehovah your God, to walk in all His ways and to love Him, to serve Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul,

13. and to keep the commandments of Jehovah and His statutes which I am commanding you today for your good.

14. Behold, the heavens and the Heaven of the heavens, and also the earth with all that is in it, belong to Jehovah your God.

15. Jehovah has longed for your fathers, to love them; and He chose their seed after them, you out of all peoples, as it is this day.

16. Therefore circumcise the foreskin of your heart, and be stiff-necked no more;

17. for Jehovah your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great Mighty God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality nor takes a bribe.

18. He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, to give him food and clothing.

19. Therefore love the sojourner, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.

20. You shall fear Jehovah your God; you shall serve Him, and cleave to Him, and you shall swear by His name.

21. He is your praise, and He is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things which your eyes have seen.

22. Your fathers went down to Egypt with seventy persons, and now Jehovah your God has made you as the stars of the heavens for multitude.

## Deuteronomy 11

1. Therefore you shall love Jehovah your God, and keep His charge, His statutes, His judgments, and His commandments always.

2. Know today that I am not speaking with your children, who have not known and who have not seen the chastening of Jehovah your God, His greatness and His mighty hand and His outstretched arm;

3. His signs and His works which He did in the midst of Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to all his land;

4. what He did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and their chariots: how He made the waters of the Red Sea overflow them as they pursued you, and how Jehovah destroyed them to this day;

5. what He has done for you in the wilderness to come to this place;

6. and what He has done to Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, their houses, their tents, and all the substance at their feet, in the midst of all Israel;

7. but your eyes have been seeing every great work of Jehovah which He has done.

8. Therefore you shall keep every commandment which I am commanding you today, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land which you are crossing over to possess,

9. and that you may prolong your days in the land which Jehovah has sworn to your fathers, to give to them and their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey.

10. For the land which you are going to possess is not like the land of Egypt from which you have come, where you sowed your seed and watered it by foot, as a vegetable garden;

11. but the land which you are crossing over to possess is a land of hills and valleys, which drinks water from the rain of the heavens,

12. a land for which Jehovah your God cares; the eyes of Jehovah your God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.

13. And it shall be that if you give heed to obey My commandments which I am commanding you today, to love Jehovah your God and serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul,

14. then I will give you the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, your new wine, and your oil.

15. And I will produce grass in your fields for your livestock, that you may eat and be filled.

16. Take heed to yourselves, that your heart not be deceived, and you turn aside and serve other gods and bow down to them,

17. and the anger of Jehovah burn against you, and He shut up the heavens so that there be no rain, and the land yield no produce, and you perish quickly from the good land which Jehovah is giving to you.

18. Therefore you shall fix these words of mine in your hearts and in your souls, and shall bind them as a sign on your hands, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.

19. You shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.

20. And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,

21. that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land of which Jehovah has sworn to your fathers to give to them, like the days of the heavens above the earth.

22. For if you give heed to keep all these commandments which I am commanding you to do; to love Jehovah your God, to walk in all His ways, and to cleave unto Him;

23. then Jehovah will drive out all these nations before you, and you shall dispossess nations that are greater and mightier than yourselves.

24. Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the River Euphrates, even to the western Sea, shall be your territory.

25. No man shall be able to stand against you; Jehovah your God will put the dread of you and the fear of you upon all the land where you tread, as He has spoken to you.

26. Behold, I set before you today a blessing and a curse:

27. the blessing, if you obey the commandments of Jehovah your God which I am commanding you today;

28. and the curse, if you do not obey the commandments of Jehovah your God, but turn aside from the way which I am commanding you today, to go after other gods which you have not known.

29. And it shall be, when Jehovah your God brings you into the land which you are going in to possess, that you shall put the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.

30. Are they not on the other side of the Jordan, toward the setting sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the plain opposite Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh.

31. For you are crossing over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving you, and you shall possess it and dwell in it.

32. And take heed to do all the statutes and judgments which I am setting before you today.

## Deuteronomy 12

1. These are the statutes and judgments which you shall take heed to do in the land which Jehovah the God of your fathers is giving you to possess, all the days that you live on the earth:

2. You shall destroy to blot out all the places where the nations which you are dispossessing have served their gods, on the high mountains and on the hills and under every green tree.

3. And you shall tear down their altars, break their sacred pillars, and burn their groves with fire; you shall chop down the graven images of their gods and destroy their names out of that place.

4. You shall not do so unto Jehovah your God.

5. But you shall regularly seek out the place where Jehovah your God chooses, out of all your tribes, to put His name for His dwelling place; and there you shall go.

6. There you shall bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the heave offerings of your hand, your vows, your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks.

7. And there you shall eat before Jehovah your God, and you shall rejoice in all to which you have put your hand, you and your households, in which Jehovah your God has blessed you.

8. You shall not do as we are doing here today; every man doing whatever is right in his own eyes;

9. for as yet you have not come to the rest and the inheritance which Jehovah your God is giving to you.

10. But when you have crossed over the Jordan and dwelt in the land which Jehovah your God is giving you to inherit, and He has given you rest from all your enemies round about, so that you dwell in safety,

11. then there shall be the place which Jehovah your God will choose to establish His name. There you shall bring all that I am commanding you: your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the heave offerings of your hand, and all your choice offerings which you vow unto Jehovah.

12. And you shall rejoice before Jehovah your God, you and your sons and your daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates, since he has no portion nor inheritance with you.

13. Take heed to yourself that you do not offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see;

14. but in the place which Jehovah chooses, in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I am commanding you.

15. However, you may slaughter and eat flesh within all your gates, whatever your soul desires, according to the blessing of Jehovah your God which He has given you; the unclean and the clean may eat of it, of the gazelle and the deer alike.

16. Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it on the earth like water.

17. You cannot eat within your gates the tithe of your grain or your new wine or your oil, of the firstborn of your herd or your flock, of any of your vows which you vow, of your freewill offerings, or of the heave offering of your hand.

18. But you shall eat them before Jehovah your God in the place which Jehovah your God chooses, you and your son and your daughter, your male servant and your female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates; and you shall rejoice before Jehovah your God in all to which you put your hands.

19. Take heed to yourself that you do not forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land.

20. When Jehovah your God enlarges your border as He has promised you, and you say, Let me eat flesh, because your soul longs to eat flesh, you may eat as much flesh as your soul desires.

21. If the place where Jehovah your God chooses to put His name is too far from you, then you shall slaughter from your herd and from your flock which Jehovah has given you, as I have commanded you, and you shall eat within your gates whatever your soul desires.

22. Just as the gazelle and the deer are eaten, so you shall eat them; the unclean and the clean alike shall eat them.

23. Only be sure not to eat the blood, for the blood is the soul; you shall not eat the soul with the flesh.

24. You shall not eat it; you shall pour it on the earth like water.

25. You shall not eat it, that it may go well with you and your children after you, when you do what is right in the eyes of Jehovah.

26. Only, the holy things which you have, and your vows, you shall take and go to the place which Jehovah chooses.

27. And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of Jehovah your God; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of Jehovah your God, and you shall eat the flesh.

28. Take heed and obey all these words which I am commanding you, that it may go well with you and your children after you always, when you do what is good and right in the eyes of Jehovah your God.

29. When Jehovah your God cuts off before you the nations which you are going in to dispossess, and you have taken possession and dwelt in their land,

30. take heed to yourself that you are not ensnared to follow them, after they are destroyed before you, and that you do not inquire after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? I also will do likewise.

31. You shall not do so unto Jehovah your God; for everything that is an abomination to Jehovah which He has hated, they have done unto their gods; for they burn even their sons and daughters in the fire unto their gods.

32. Whatever I am commanding you, take heed to do it; you shall not add to it nor take away from it.

## Deuteronomy 13

1. If there arises among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams, and he gives you a sign or a wonder,

2. and the sign or the wonder comes to pass, of which he spoke to you, saying, Let us go after other gods, which you have not known, and let us serve them;

3. you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams, for Jehovah your God is testing you to know whether you love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul.

4. You shall walk after Jehovah your God and fear Him, and keep His commandments and obey His voice, and you shall serve Him and cleave unto Him.

5. But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has spoken apostasy away from Jehovah your God, who is bringing you out of the land of Egypt and is redeeming you from the house of bondage, to thrust you out of the way in which Jehovah your God has commanded you to walk. Thus you shall put away the evil from your midst.

6. If your brother, the son of your mother, your son or your daughter, the wife of your bosom, or your friend who is as your own soul, secretly entices you, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known, neither you nor your fathers,

7. of the gods of the people all around you, near to you or far off from you, from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth,

8. you shall not consent to him or listen to him, nor shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare him or conceal him;

9. but you shall kill him to death; your hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people.

10. And you shall stone him with stones so that he dies, because he has sought to thrust you away from Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

11. Thus all Israel shall hear and fear, and not again do such wickedness as this among you.

12. If you hear someone in one of your cities, which Jehovah your God gives you to dwell in, saying,

13. Corrupt men have gone out from among you and impelled the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known;

14. then you shall inquire, search out, and ask thoroughly. And if it is indeed true and the matter is firmly established that such an abomination has been done among you,

15. you shall strike to kill the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword; utterly destroying it, all that is in it and its livestock, with the edge of the sword.

16. And you shall gather all its plunder into the middle of the open place, and completely burn with fire the city and all its plunder, before Jehovah your God. It shall always remain a heap; it shall not be built again.

17. And none of the accursed things shall cleave to your hand, that Jehovah may turn from the fierceness of His anger and show you mercy, have compassion on you and multiply you, just as He has sworn to your fathers,

18. because you heeded the voice of Jehovah your God, to keep all His commandments which I am commanding you today, to do what is right in the eyes of Jehovah your God.

## Deuteronomy 14

1. You are the children of Jehovah your God; you shall not cut yourselves nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.

2. For you are a holy people unto Jehovah your God, and Jehovah has chosen you to be a people for Himself, a special treasure out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.

3. You shall not eat any abominable thing.

4. These are the animals which you may eat: the ox, the sheep of the flock, the goat,

5. the deer, the gazelle, the roe deer, the wild goat, the mountain goat, the antelope, and the mountain sheep.

6. And you may eat every animal that divides the hoof, the cleft of the hoof being cloven in two, and that brings up the cud, among the animals.

7. Nevertheless, you shall not eat of those that only bring up the cud, or only divide the cloven hoof: the camel, the hare, and the hyrax; for they bring up the cud but do not divide the hoof; they are unclean to you.

8. Also the swine is unclean to you, because it divides the hoof, yet does not bring up the cud; you shall not eat their flesh or touch their dead carcass.

9. These you may eat of all that are in the waters: you may eat all that have fins and scales.

10. And whatever does not have fins and scales you shall not eat; it is unclean to you.

11. All clean birds you may eat.

12. But these you shall not eat: the eagle, the vulture, the buzzard,

13. the hawk, the falcon, and the kite after its kind;

14. every raven after its kind;

15. the ostrich, the great owl, the seagull, and the hawk after their kinds;

16. the little owl, the eared owl, the barn owl,

17. the pelican, the carrion vulture, the cormorant,

18. the stork, the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe and the bat.

19. Also every swarming thing that flies is unclean to you; they shall not be eaten.

20. But, you may eat all clean birds.

21. You shall not eat anything that dies of itself; you may give it to the sojourner who is within your gates, that he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner; for you are a holy people unto Jehovah your God. You shall not boil a kid in its mothers milk.

22. You shall give a tithe to tithe all the increase of your seed that the field yields year by year.

23. And you shall eat before Jehovah your God, in the place where He chooses to establish His name, the tithe of your grain and your new wine and your oil, of the firstborn of your herds and your flocks, that you may learn to fear Jehovah your God all your days.

24. But if the journey is too long for you, so that you are not able to carry it, or if the place where Jehovah your God chooses to put His name is too far from you, when Jehovah your God has blessed you,

25. then you shall exchange it for money, take the money in your hand, and go to the place which Jehovah your God shall choose.

26. And you shall spend that money for whatever your soul desires: for oxen or sheep, for wine or strong drink, for whatever your soul desires; you shall eat there before Jehovah your God, and you shall rejoice, you and your household.

27. You shall not forsake the Levite who is within your gates, for he has no part nor inheritance with you.

28. At the end of every third year you shall bring out the tithe of your produce of that year and store it up within your gates.

29. And the Levite, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you, and the sojourner and the fatherless and the widow who are within your gates, shall come and eat and be satisfied; that Jehovah your God may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do.

## Deuteronomy 15

1. At the end of every seven years you shall grant a release of debts.

2. And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor who has loaned anything to his neighbor shall let it drop; he shall not exact it of his neighbor or his brother, because it has been proclaimed the release of Jehovah.

3. Of a foreigner you may exact it; but whatever is with your brother, your hand shall let it drop,

4. that there be no one in need among you; for Jehovah will greatly bless you in the land which Jehovah your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance;

5. only if you listen to obey the voice of Jehovah your God, to take heed to do all these commandments which I am commanding you today.

6. For Jehovah your God will bless you just as He has promised you; you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow; you shall have dominion over many nations, but they shall not rule over you.

7. If there is among you, of your brethren within any of the gates in your land which Jehovah your God is giving you, a man who is in need, you shall not harden your heart nor shut your hand from your needy brother,

8. but you shall open your hand, to open unto him and lend, to lend to him sufficient for his need in whatever he is lacking.

9. Beware that there not be a thought in your wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, approaches; and your eye be evil against your needy brother and you give him nothing, and he cry out to Jehovah against you, and it become sin unto you.

10. You shall lend to give to him, and your heart shall not tremble to give to him; because for this thing Jehovah your God will bless you in all your works and in all to which you put your hand.

11. For the needy will never cease from the land; therefore I command you, saying, You shall open, to open your hand unto your brother, to your poor and your needy, in your land.

12. If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you and serves you six years, then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you.

13. And when you send him away free from you, you shall not send him away empty;

14. you shall richly adorn him from your flock, from your threshing floor, and from your winepress. From out of whatever Jehovah has blessed you, you shall give to him.

15. You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah your God redeemed you; therefore I command you this thing today.

16. And if it happens that he says to you, I will not go out from you, because he loves you and your household, since it has been good for him with you;

17. then you shall take an awl and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall continue to be your servant. And to your female servant you shall do likewise.

18. It shall not be difficult in your eyes to let him go free from you; for he has served you six years for double the wages of a hired servant. And Jehovah your God will bless you in all that you do.

19. All the firstborn males that your herd and your flock bring forth you shall consecrate unto Jehovah your God; you shall do no work with the firstborn of your ox, nor shear the firstborn of your sheep.

20. You and your household shall eat it before Jehovah your God year by year in the place which Jehovah chooses.

21. But if there is a blemish in it, if it is lame or blind or has any bad blemish, you shall not sacrifice it unto Jehovah your God.

22. You shall eat it within your gates; the unclean and the clean alike, as a gazelle or a deer.

23. Only you shall not eat its blood; you shall pour it on the ground like water.

## Deuteronomy 16

1. Observe the month of Abib, and keep the Passover unto Jehovah your God, for in the month of Abib Jehovah your God has brought you out of Egypt by night.

2. You shall sacrifice the Passover unto Jehovah your God, from the flock and the herd, in the place where Jehovah chooses to establish His name.

3. You shall eat nothing leavened with it; seven days you shall eat unleavened bread with it, the bread of affliction (for you came out of the land of Egypt in haste), that you may remember the day in which you came out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life.

4. And no leaven shall be seen with you in all your territory for seven days, nor shall any of the flesh which you sacrifice the first day at evening remain overnight until morning.

5. You shall not sacrifice the Passover within just any of your gates which Jehovah your God gives you;

6. but at the place where Jehovah your God chooses to establish His name, there you shall sacrifice the Passover at evening, at the going down of the sun, at the appointed time that you came out of Egypt.

7. And you shall cook and eat it in the place which Jehovah your God chooses, and in the morning you shall turn and go to your tents.

8. Six days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a solemn assembly unto Jehovah your God. You shall do no work.

9. You shall count seven weeks for yourself; begin to count the seven weeks from when you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain.

10. And you shall keep the Feast of Weeks unto Jehovah your God with the portion of a freewill offering from your hand, which you shall give as Jehovah your God blesses you.

11. You shall rejoice before Jehovah your God, you and your son and your daughter, your male servant and your female servant, the Levite who is within your gates, the sojourner and the fatherless and the widow who are among you, at the place where Jehovah your God chooses to establish His name.

12. And you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and you shall take heed to do these statutes.

13. You shall observe the Feast of Booths seven days, when you have gathered from your threshing floor and from your winepress.

14. And you shall rejoice in your feast, you and your son and your daughter, your male servant and your female servant and the Levite, the sojourner and the fatherless and the widow, who are within your gates.

15. Seven days you shall keep a feast unto Jehovah your God in the place which Jehovah chooses, because Jehovah your God will bless you in all your produce and in all the work of your hands, so that you shall be joyful.

16. Three times a year all your males shall appear before Jehovah your God in the place which He chooses: at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, at the Feast of Weeks, and at the Feast of Booths; and they shall not appear before Jehovah empty.

17. Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of Jehovah your God which He has given you.

18. You shall appoint judges and officers in all your gates, which Jehovah your God gives you, according to your tribes, and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.

19. You shall not pervert justice; you shall not show partiality, nor take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and perverts the words of the righteous.

20. Justice, only justice shall you follow, that you may live and inherit the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you.

21. You shall not plant for yourself any tree as a grove near the altar which you build for yourself unto Jehovah your God.

22. You shall not set up a sacred pillar, which Jehovah your God hates.

## Deuteronomy 17

1. You shall not sacrifice unto Jehovah your God a bull or sheep which has any blemish or evil thing, for that is an abomination unto Jehovah your God.

2. If there is found among you, within any of your gates which Jehovah your God is giving you, a man or a woman who has done evil in the eyes of Jehovah your God, in transgressing His covenant,

3. who has gone and served other gods and bowed down to them, either the sun or moon or any of the host of the heavens, which I have not commanded,

4. and it has been reported to you, and you have heard of it, and you have inquired thoroughly, and behold, it is true and the matter is certain, that such an abomination has been done in Israel;

5. then you shall bring out to your gates that man or woman who has done that evil thing, and shall stone that man or woman with stones until they have died.

6. Whoever is deserving of death shall be put to death at the mouth of two or three witnesses; he shall not be put to death at the mouth of one witness.

7. The hands of the witnesses shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. Thus you shall put away the evil from among you.

8. If a matter arises which is too hard for you to judge, between blood and blood, between dispute and dispute, or between stroke and stroke, matters of controversy within your gates, then you shall arise and go up to the place which Jehovah your God chooses.

9. And you shall come to the priests, the Levites, and to the judge who is there in those days, and inquire; and they shall declare to you the judgment of the case.

10. You shall do according to the mouth of the word which they declare to you in that place which Jehovah chooses. And you shall take heed to do according to all that they instruct you.

11. According to the mouth of the law which they instruct you, according to the judgment which they command you, you shall do; you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left from the word which they declare to you.

12. And the man who acts presumptuously to not heed the priest who is standing to serve there before Jehovah your God, or the judge, that man shall die. Thus you shall put away the evil from Israel.

13. And all the people shall hear and fear, and no longer act presumptuously.

14. When you come to the land which Jehovah your God is giving you, and have possessed it and dwelt in it, and say, I will set a king over me like all the nations that are around me,

15. you shall appoint to establish a king over you whom Jehovah your God chooses; one from among your brethren you shall set as king over you; you shall not designate a foreign man over you, who is not your brother.

16. And he shall not multiply horses for himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt to multiply horses, for Jehovah has said to you, You shall not return that way again.

17. Neither shall he multiply wives for himself, that his heart not be turned aside; nor shall he greatly multiply silver and gold for himself.

18. It shall also be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write for himself a copy of this Law in a book, from the one that is before the priests, the Levites.

19. And it shall be with him, and he shall read it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear Jehovah his God, to keep all the Words of this Law and these statutes, to do them;

20. that his heart may not be lifted up above his brethren, that he may not turn aside from the commandment to the right hand or to the left, and that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his sons in the midst of Israel.

## Deuteronomy 18

1. The priests, the Levites, all the tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel; they shall eat the offerings of Jehovah by fire, and His portion.

2. Therefore they shall have no inheritance among their brethren; Jehovah is their inheritance, as He has spoken to them.

3. And this shall be the priests due from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice, whether it is bull or sheep: they shall give to the priest the shoulder, the cheeks, and the stomach.

4. The firstfruits of your grain and your new wine and your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep, you shall give to him.

5. For Jehovah your God has chosen him out of all your tribes to stand to serve in the name of Jehovah; him and his sons forever.

6. Thus if a Levite comes from any of your gates, from where he has been sojourning among all Israel, and comes with all the desire of his soul to the place which Jehovah chooses,

7. then he shall serve in the name of Jehovah his God as all his brethren the Levites do, who stand before Jehovah.

8. They shall eat portion like portion, besides their inheritance of the sale of their fathers estate.

9. When you come into the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you, you shall not learn to do according to the abominations of those nations.

10. There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, or one who practices divination, or conjuring, or fortunetelling, or sorcery,

11. or one who charms magic spells, or a medium, or a wizard, or one who calls up the dead.

12. For all who do these things are an abomination unto Jehovah, and because of these abominations Jehovah your God is dispossessing them before you.

13. You shall be perfect before Jehovah your God.

14. For these nations which you shall dispossess listened to fortunetelling and divining. But as for you, Jehovah your God has not consecrated you to such things.

15. Jehovah your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your midst, from your brethren. Him you shall hear,

16. according to all that you desired of Jehovah your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of Jehovah my God, nor let me see this great fire anymore, that I not die.

17. And Jehovah said to me: In that, they have spoken well.

18. I will raise up for them a Prophet like you from among their brethren, and will put My Words in His mouth, and He shall speak to them all that I command Him.

19. And it shall be that whoever will not give heed to My Words, which He speaks in My name, I will require it of him.

20. But the prophet who presumes to speak a word in My name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die.

21. And if you think in your heart, How shall we know the word which Jehovah has not spoken?

22. when a prophet speaks in the name of Jehovah, if the thing does not happen or come to pass, that is the thing which Jehovah has not spoken; the prophet has spoken it presumptuously; you shall not be afraid of him.

## Deuteronomy 19

1. When Jehovah your God cuts off the nations whose land Jehovah your God is giving to you, and you have dispossessed them and dwelt in their cities and in their houses,

2. you shall separate three cities for yourself in the midst of your land which Jehovah your God is giving you to possess.

3. You shall prepare roads for yourself, and divide into three parts the territory of your land which Jehovah your God is giving you to inherit, that any manslayer may flee there.

4. And this is the case of the manslayer who flees there, that he may live: Whoever strikes his neighbor unintentionally, not hating him in time past;

5. as when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut timber, and his hand swings a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree, and the head has slipped from the handle and struck his neighbor so that he has died; he shall flee to one of these cities and live;

6. lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer and overtake him because the way is long, and kill him while his emotions are hot, though he is not deserving of death, since he had not hated his neighbor in time past.

7. Therefore I am commanding you, saying, You shall separate three cities for yourself.

8. Now if Jehovah your God enlarges your territory, as He has sworn to your fathers, and gives you the land which He has promised to give to your fathers,

9. and if you keep all these commandments to do them, which I am commanding you today, to love Jehovah your God and to walk always in His ways, then you shall add three more cities for yourself besides these three,

10. that innocent blood not be shed in the midst of your land which Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance, and thus there be blood upon you.

11. But if anyone, while hating his neighbor, has laid in wait for him, risen against him and struck his soul so that he has died, and he has fled to one of these cities,

12. then the elders of his city shall send and bring him from there, and deliver him over to the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.

13. Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with you.

14. You shall not remove your neighbors landmark, which the men of old have set, in your inheritance which you shall inherit in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to possess.

15. One witness shall not rise up against a man concerning any iniquity or any sin that he sins; at the mouth of two or three witnesses the matter shall be established.

16. If a false witness rises up against any man to testify against him regarding apostasy,

17. then both men in the controversy shall stand before Jehovah, before the priests and the judges who hold office in those days.

18. And the judges shall investigate thoroughly, and indeed, if the witness is a false witness, who has testified falsely against his brother,

19. then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother; thus you shall remove the evil from among you.

20. And those who remain shall hear and fear, and thereafter they shall not again commit such evil among you.

21. Your eye shall not pity: soul for soul, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.

## Deuteronomy 20

1. When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see horses and chariots and people more numerous than you, do not be afraid of them; for Jehovah your God is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.

2. And it shall be, when you approach the battle, that the priest shall draw near and speak to the people.

3. And he shall say to them, Hear, O Israel: Today you are approaching battle with your enemies. Do not let your heart faint, do not be afraid, and do not tremble nor be terrified before them;

4. for Jehovah your God is He who is going before you, to engage your enemies in battle, to deliver you.

5. And the officers shall speak to the people, saying: What man is there who has built a new house and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, that he not die in battle and another man dedicate it.

6. And what man is there who has planted a vineyard and has not eaten of it? Let him go and return to his house, that he not die in battle and another man violate it.

7. And what man is there who has betrothed a woman and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, that he not die in battle and another man take her.

8. And the officers shall speak further to the people, and say, What man is there who is fearful and faint-hearted? Let him go and return to his house, that the heart of his brethren not melt like his heart.

9. And so it shall be, when the officers have finished speaking to the people, that they shall appoint commanders of the armies at the head of the people.

10. When you go near a city to fight against it, then proclaim an offer of peace to it.

11. And it shall be that if they respond in peace and open to you, then all the people who are found in it shall be tributaries to you, and serve you.

12. But if the city will not make peace with you, but makes war against you, then you shall besiege it.

13. And when Jehovah your God has delivered it into your hands, you shall strike every male in it with the edge of the sword.

14. But the women, the little ones, the livestock, and all that is in the city, all its spoils, you shall plunder for yourself; and you shall eat the plunder of your enemies which Jehovah your God has given to you.

15. Thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far from you, which are not of the cities of these nations.

16. But of the cities of these peoples which Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance, you shall let nothing that breathes remain alive,

17. but you shall destroy to exterminate them: the Hittite and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, as Jehovah your God has commanded you;

18. that they not teach you to do according to all their abominations which they have done unto their gods, and you sin against Jehovah your God.

19. When you besiege a city many days, to make war against it to capture it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them, if you can eat from them; do not cut them down. For is the tree of the field a man, to be besieged by you?

20. Only the trees which you know are not trees for food you may destroy and cut down, to build siege works against the city making war with you, until it is subdued.

## Deuteronomy 21

1. If anyone is found slain, lying in the field in the land which Jehovah your God is giving you to possess, and it is not known who has struck him,

2. then your elders and your judges shall go out and measure the distance from the one slain to the surrounding cities.

3. And it shall be that the elders of the city nearest to the slain person shall take a heifer from the herd which has not been worked and which has not drawn with a yoke.

4. And the elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with a flowing stream, which is neither plowed nor sown, and they shall break the heifers neck there in the valley.

5. And the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come near (for Jehovah your God has chosen them to serve Him and to bless in the name of Jehovah), and by their word every controversy and every stroke shall be tried.

6. And all the elders of that city nearest to the slain person shall wash their hands in the stream over the heifer whose neck was broken.

7. And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, nor have our eyes seen it.

8. Provide atonement, O Jehovah, for Your people Israel, whom You have redeemed, and do not lay innocent blood to the charge of Your people Israel. And the blood shall be covered.

9. Thus you shall put away innocent blood from among you when you do what is right in the eyes of Jehovah.

10. When you go out to war against your enemies, and Jehovah your God has delivered them into your hand, and you have taken them captive,

11. and you see among the captives a woman with a beautiful figure, and desire her and would take her for your wife,

12. then you shall bring her home to your house, and she shall shave her head and do her nails.

13. She shall put off the clothes of her captivity, remain in your house, and mourn her father and her mother a month of days; after that you may go in to her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.

14. And it shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall set her free, but you certainly shall not sell her for money; you shall not treat her as a slave, because you have humbled her.

15. If a man has two wives, one loved and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the loved and the hated, and if the firstborn son is of her who is hated,

16. then it shall be, on the day he bequeaths his possessions to his sons, that he shall not make the son of the loved wife the firstborn before the son of the hated, the true firstborn.

17. But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated wife as the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.

18. If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and who, when they have chastened him, will not obey them,

19. then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city, to the gate of his place.

20. And they shall say to the elders of his city, This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard.

21. Then all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones; thus you shall put away the evil from among you, and all Israel shall hear and fear.

22. If a man is guilty of a sin deserving of death, and he is put to death, and you have hung him on a tree,

23. his corpse shall not remain overnight on the tree, but you shall surely bury him that day, so that you do not defile the land which Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance; for he who is hanging is accursed of God.

## Deuteronomy 22

1. You shall not see your brothers ox or his sheep going astray, and hide yourself from them; you shall turn them back to restore them to your brother.

2. And if your brother is not near you, or if you do not know him, then you shall bring it to your own house, and it shall remain with you until your brother seeks for it; and you shall restore it to him.

3. You shall do the same with his donkey, and so shall you do with his garment; with any lost thing of your brothers, which he has lost and you have found, you shall do likewise; you cannot hide it.

4. You shall not see your brothers donkey or his ox fallen down along the road, and hide yourself from them; you shall help him lift it up to make it stand.

5. A woman shall not wear anything that is fitting to a man, nor shall a man put on a womans garments, for all who do so are an abomination unto Jehovah your God.

6. If a birds nest happens to be before you along the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, with the mother sitting on the young or on the eggs, you shall not take the mother with the young;

7. you shall let the mother go free, and take the young for yourself, that it may be well with you and that you may prolong your days.

8. When you build a new house, then you shall make a railing for your roof, that you may not bring blood upon your house if anyone falls from it.

9. You shall not sow your vineyard with different kinds of seed, that the yield of the seed which you have sown and the fruit of your vineyard not be defiled.

10. You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.

11. You shall not wear a garment of mixed fabric, such as wool and linen together.

12. You shall make tassels on the four corners of the clothing with which you cover yourself.

13. If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her, and hates her,

14. and charges her with wantonness, and brings a bad name upon her, and says, I took this woman, and when I came to her I found she was not a virgin;

15. then the father and mother of the young woman shall take and bring out the evidence of the young womans virginity to the elders of the city at the gate.

16. And the young womans father shall say to the elders, I have given my daughter to this man as wife, and he hates her.

17. And behold, he has charged her with wantonness, saying, I have found your daughter to not be a virgin, and yet these are the evidences of my daughters virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.

18. And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;

19. and they shall fine him one hundred shekels of silver and give them to the father of the young woman, because he has brought a bad name on a virgin of Israel. And she shall be his wife; he cannot put her away all his days.

20. But if the thing is true, and evidence of virginity is not found for the young woman,

21. then they shall bring out the young woman to the door of her fathers house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she has done a disgraceful thing in Israel, to commit harlotry in her fathers house. Thus you shall put away the evil from among you.

22. If a man is found lying with a woman married to a husband, then both of them shall die; the man that lay with the woman, and the woman; thus you shall put away the evil from Israel.

23. If a young woman who is a virgin is betrothed to a man, and a man finds her in the city and lies with her,

24. then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones, the young woman because she did not cry out in the city, and the man because he has humbled his neighbors wife; thus you shall put away the evil from among you.

25. But if a man finds a betrothed young woman in the field, and the man forces her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die.

26. But you shall do nothing to the young woman; there is in the young woman no sin deserving of death, for just as when a man rises against his neighbor and kills him, even so is this matter;

27. for he had found her in the field, and the betrothed young woman had cried out, but there was no one to deliver her.

28. If a man finds a young woman who is a virgin, who is not betrothed, and he seizes her and lies with her, and they are found out,

29. then the man who lay with her shall give to the young womans father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife because he has humbled her; he cannot put her away all his days.

30. A man shall not take his fathers wife, nor uncover his fathers skirt.

## Deuteronomy 23

1. He who is wounded by crushing or had his male organ cut off shall not enter the assembly of Jehovah.

2. One of illegitimate birth shall not enter the assembly of Jehovah; even to the tenth generation none of his shall enter the assembly of Jehovah.

3. An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter the assembly of Jehovah; even to the tenth generation none of them shall enter the assembly of Jehovah, perpetually;

4. because they did not meet you with bread and water on the way when you came out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.

5. Nevertheless Jehovah your God would not listen to Balaam, but Jehovah your God turned the curse into a blessing for you, because Jehovah your God has loved you.

6. You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days, perpetually.

7. You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother. You shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you were a sojourner in his land.

8. The children of the third generation born to them may enter the assembly of Jehovah.

9. When the army goes out against your enemies, then keep yourself from every evil thing.

10. If there is any man among you who becomes unclean by accident in the night, then he shall go outside the camp; he shall not come inside the camp.

11. But it shall be, when evening comes, that he shall wash with water; and when the sun sets, he shall come into the camp.

12. Also you shall have a place outside the camp, where you may go out;

13. and you shall have a spade among your tools, and when you sit outside, you shall dig with it and turn over and cover your excrement.

14. For Jehovah your God walks in the midst of your camp, to deliver you and give up your enemies before you; therefore your camp shall be holy, that He may see no unclean thing among you, and turn away from you.

15. You shall not deliver up to his master a slave who has escaped from his master to you.

16. He shall dwell with you in your midst, in the place which he chooses within one of your gates, where it is agreeable to him; you shall not oppress him.

17. There shall be no female temple prostitute of the daughters of Israel, nor a male temple prostitute of the sons of Israel.

18. You shall not bring the wages of prostitution or the price of a dog into the house of Jehovah your God for any vow, for both of these are an abomination unto Jehovah your God.

19. You shall not charge interest to your brother; interest on money or food or anything that is loaned at interest.

20. To a foreigner you may charge interest, but to your brother you shall not charge interest, that Jehovah your God may bless you in all to which you put your hand in the land which you are entering to possess.

21. When you vow a vow unto Jehovah your God, you shall not delay to pay it; for Jehovah your God will seek to require it of you, and it would be sin in you.

22. But if you abstain from vowing, it shall not be sin in you.

23. That which has gone forth from your lips you shall keep and do; that which you have voluntarily vowed unto Jehovah your God, what you have promised with your mouth.

24. When you come into your neighbors vineyard, you may eat your fill of grapes at your pleasure, but you shall not put any in your vessel.

25. When you come into your neighbors standing grain, you may pluck the heads with your hand, but you shall not swing a sickle into your neighbors standing grain.

## Deuteronomy 24

1. When a man takes a wife and marries her, and it happens that she finds no favor in his eyes because he has found some uncleanness in her, and he writes her a certificate of divorce, puts it in her hand, and sends her out of his house,

2. if she has departed from his house, and goes and becomes another mans wife,

3. if the latter husband hates her and writes her a certificate of divorce, puts it in her hand, and sends her out of his house, or if the latter husband who took her as his wife dies,

4. then her former husband who sent her away cannot take her back to be his wife after she has been defiled; for that is an abomination before Jehovah, and you shall not bring sin upon the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you as an inheritance.

5. When a man has taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war nor leave for any business; he shall be free at home one year, and bring gladness to his wife whom he has taken.

6. No man shall take the lower or the upper millstone in pledge, for he takes ones soul in pledge.

7. If a man is found kidnapping any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and has treated him as a slave or sold him, then that kidnapper shall die; thus you shall put away the evil from among you.

8. Take heed regarding the plague of leprosy, that you take great heed to do according to all that the priests, the Levites, shall teach you; as I have commanded them, thus you shall take heed to do.

9. Remember what Jehovah your God did to Miriam on the way when you came out of Egypt.

10. When you lend your brother anything, you shall not go into his house to get his pledge.

11. You shall stand outside, and the man to whom you lend shall bring the pledge out to you.

12. And if the man is poor, you shall not sleep with his pledge.

13. You shall return and bring the pledge back to him when the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his own garment and bless you; and it shall be righteousness in you before Jehovah your God.

14. You shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether one of your brethren or one of the sojourners who is in your land within your gates.

15. Each day you shall give him his wages, and not let the sun go down on it, for he is poor and is sustaining his soul with it; lest he cry out against you unto Jehovah, and it be sin in you.

16. Fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor shall the sons be put to death for their fathers; every man shall be put to death for his own sin.

17. You shall not pervert justice due the sojourner or the fatherless, nor take a widows garment as a pledge.

18. But you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and Jehovah your God redeemed you from there; therefore I am commanding you to do this thing.

19. When you reap your harvest in your field, and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you shall not go back to get it; it shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow; and Jehovah your God shall bless you in all the work of your hands.

20. When you beat your olive trees, you shall not go over the boughs again; it shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow.

21. When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it afterward; it shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow.

22. And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore I am commanding you to do this thing.

## Deuteronomy 25

1. If there is a dispute between men, and they come to court, that the judges may judge them, and they justify the righteous and condemn the wicked,

2. then it shall be, if the wicked man deserves to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie prostrate and be beaten in his presence, according to his guilt, by number.

3. He may beat him forty times and no more, lest he should exceed this and beat him with many stripes above these, and your brother be degraded in your eyes.

4. You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.

5. If brothers dwell together, and one of them dies and has no son, the widow of the dead man shall not be married to a strange man outside the family; her husbands brother shall go in to her, take her as his wife, and perform the duty of a husbands brother to her.

6. And it shall be that the firstborn son which she bears shall succeed to the name of his dead brother, that his name not be blotted out of Israel.

7. But if the man does not desire to take his brothers wife, then his brothers wife shall go up to the gate to the elders, and say, My husbands brother refuses to raise up a name to his brother in Israel; he will not perform the duty of my husbands brother.

8. If after the elders of his city have summoned him and spoken to him, he has stood firm and said, I do not desire to take her,

9. then his brothers wife shall come to him in the presence of the elders, remove his sandal from his foot, spit in his face, and answer and say, So shall it be done to the man who will not build up the house of his brother.

10. And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him who had his sandal removed.

11. If two men strive with one another, and the wife of one draws near to rescue her husband from the hand of the one striking him, and puts out her hand and grabs him by the genitals,

12. then you shall cut off her hand; your eye shall not pity.

13. You shall not have in your bag a stone and a stone weight, a great and small.

14. You shall not have in your house an ephah and ephah, a large and small.

15. You shall have perfect and just weight stones, a perfect and just ephah; that your days may be prolonged in the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you.

16. For all who do such things, all who do unrighteously, are an abomination unto Jehovah your God.

17. Remember what Amalek did to you on the way as you were coming forth out of Egypt,

18. how he met you on the way and attacked your rear, all the feeble ones following at the rear, when you were exhausted and weary; and he did not fear God.

19. Therefore it shall be, when Jehovah your God has given you rest from your enemies all around, in the land which Jehovah your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance, that you shall blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens. You shall not forget.

## Deuteronomy 26

1. And it shall be, when you come into the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you as an inheritance, and you have possessed it and dwelt in it,

2. that you shall take some of the first of all the produce of the ground, which you shall bring from your land that Jehovah your God is giving to you, and put it in a basket and go to the place where Jehovah your God chooses to establish His name.

3. And you shall go to the one who is priest in those days, and say to him, I declare today unto Jehovah your God that I have come to the land which Jehovah has sworn to our fathers to give to us.

4. And the priest shall take the basket out of your hand and set it down before the altar of Jehovah your God.

5. And you shall answer and say before Jehovah your God: My father was an Aramean, about to perish, and he went down to Egypt and sojourned there, few in number; and there he became a nation, great, mighty, and populous.

6. And the Egyptians mistreated us, afflicted us, and laid cruel labor upon us.

7. And we cried out unto Jehovah the God of our fathers, and Jehovah heard our voice and looked upon our affliction and our labor and our oppression.

8. And Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm, with great terror and with signs and wonders.

9. And He has brought us to this place and has given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey;

10. and now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land which you, O Jehovah, have given me. And you shall set it before Jehovah your God, and bow down before Jehovah your God.

11. And you shall rejoice in every good thing which Jehovah your God has given to you and your house, you and the Levite and the sojourner who is among you.

12. When you have finished tithing all the tithe of your increase in the third year; the year of tithing; and have given it to the Levite, the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, so that they may eat within your gates and be filled,

13. then you shall say before Jehovah your God: I have removed the holy things from my house, and also have given them to the Levite, the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, according to all Your commandments which You have commanded me; I have not transgressed Your commandments, nor have I forgotten them.

14. I have not eaten any of it when in mourning, nor have I removed any of it for an unclean use, nor given any of it for the dead. I have obeyed the voice of Jehovah my God, and have done according to all that You have commanded me.

15. Look down from Your holy habitation, from Heaven, and bless Your people Israel and the land which You have given to us, as You have sworn to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.

16. This day Jehovah your God is commanding you to do these statutes and judgments; therefore you shall take heed to do them with all your heart and with all your soul.

17. Today you have declared Jehovah to be your God, and to walk in His ways and to keep His statutes, His commandments, and His judgments, and to obey His voice.

18. And today Jehovah has declared you to be His treasured people, as He has promised you; for you to keep all His commandments,

19. and to make you high above all nations which He has made, in praise, in name, and in honor, and that you may be a holy people unto Jehovah your God, as He has spoken.

## Deuteronomy 27

1. And Moses, with the elders of Israel, commanded the people, saying: Keep all the commandments which I am commanding you today.

2. And it shall be, on the day when you cross over the Jordan to the land which Jehovah your God is giving you, that you shall set up for yourselves large stones, and whitewash them with lime.

3. And you shall write on them all the Words of this Law, when you have crossed over, that you may enter the land which Jehovah your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, just as Jehovah the God of your fathers has promised you.

4. Therefore it shall be, when you have crossed over the Jordan, that on Mount Ebal you shall set up these stones, which I am commanding you today, and you shall whitewash them with lime.

5. And there you shall build an altar unto Jehovah your God, an altar of stones; you shall not use an iron tool on them.

6. You shall build with whole stones the altar of Jehovah your God, and offer burnt offerings on it unto Jehovah your God.

7. You shall offer peace offerings, and shall eat there, and rejoice before Jehovah your God.

8. And you shall write very plainly on the stones all the Words of this Law.

9. And Moses and the priests, the Levites, spoke to all Israel, saying, Be silent and listen, O Israel: This day you have become the people of Jehovah your God.

10. Therefore you shall obey the voice of Jehovah your God, and do His commandments and His statutes which I am commanding you today.

11. And Moses charged the people on the same day, saying,

12. These shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people when you have crossed over the Jordan: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin;

13. and these shall stand on Mount Ebal to curse: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.

14. And the Levites shall speak with a loud voice and say to all the men of Israel:

15. Cursed is the one who makes a graven or molten image, an abomination to Jehovah, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and sets it up in secret. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen!

16. Cursed is the one who treats his father or his mother with contempt. And all the people shall say, Amen!

17. Cursed is the one who moves his neighbors landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen!

18. Cursed is the one who makes the blind to wander off the road. And all the people shall say, Amen!

19. Cursed is the one who perverts the justice due the sojourner, the fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen!

20. Cursed is the one who lies with his fathers wife, because he has uncovered his fathers skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen!

21. Cursed is the one who lies with any kind of animal. And all the people shall say, Amen!

22. Cursed is the one who lies with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen!

23. Cursed is the one who lies with his mother-in-law. And all the people shall say, Amen!

24. Cursed is the one who strikes his neighbor secretly. And all the people shall say, Amen!

25. Cursed is the one who takes a bribe to strike the blood of an innocent soul. And all the people shall say, Amen!

26. Cursed is the one who does not confirm all the Words of this Law. And all the people shall say, Amen!

## Deuteronomy 28

1. And it shall come to pass, if you take heed to obey the voice of Jehovah your God, to take heed to do all His commandments which I am commanding you today, that Jehovah your God will set you high above all nations of the earth.

2. And all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, because you obey the voice of Jehovah your God:

3. Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be in the field.

4. Blessed shall be the fruit of your womb, the fruit of your ground and the fruit of your livestock, the offspring of your cattle and the increase of your flocks.

5. Blessed shall be your basket and your kneading bowl.

6. Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you be when you go out.

7. Jehovah shall cause your enemies who rise against you to be stricken before your face; they shall come out against you one way and flee before you seven ways.

8. Jehovah shall command the blessing on you in your storehouses and in all to which you put your hand, and He will bless you in the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you.

9. Jehovah will establish you as a holy people unto Himself, as He has sworn unto you, if you keep the commandments of Jehovah your God and have walked in His ways.

10. And all peoples of the earth shall see that you are called by the name of Jehovah, and they shall be afraid of you.

11. And Jehovah will make you exceed in prosperity, in the fruit of your womb, in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, in the land of which Jehovah has sworn to your fathers to give to you.

12. Jehovah will open to you His good treasure, the heavens, to give the rain to your land in its season, and to bless all the work of your hand. You shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow.

13. And Jehovah will make you the head and not the tail; you shall be above only, and not be beneath, if you heed the commandments of Jehovah your God, which I am commanding you today, and take heed to do them.

14. And you shall not turn aside from any of the words which I am commanding you this day, to the right or the left, to go after other gods to serve them.

15. But it shall come to pass, if you do not obey the voice of Jehovah your God, to take heed to do all His commandments and His statutes which I am commanding you today, that all these curses shall come upon you and overtake you:

16. Cursed shall you be in the city, and cursed shall you be in the field.

17. Cursed shall be your basket and your kneading bowl.

18. Cursed shall be the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your land, the offspring of your cattle and the increase of your flocks.

19. Cursed shall you be when you come in, and cursed shall you be when you go out.

20. Jehovah will send upon you cursing, turmoil, and rebuke in all that you set your hand to do, until you are destroyed and until you perish quickly, because of the evil of your doings in which you have forsaken Me.

21. Jehovah will make the plague cling to you until He has consumed you from off the land which you are going in to possess.

22. Jehovah will strike you with consumption, with fever, with inflammation, with burning fever, with the sword, with blight, and with mildew; they shall pursue you until you perish.

23. And your heavens over your head shall be bronze, and the earth under you shall be iron.

24. Jehovah will make the rain of your land into dust and powder; from the heavens it shall come down upon you until you are destroyed.

25. Jehovah will cause you to be stricken before your enemies; you shall go out one way against them and flee seven ways before them; and you shall be an object of terror to all the kingdoms of the earth.

26. Your carcasses shall be food for all the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the earth, and no one shall frighten them away.

27. Jehovah will strike you with the boils of Egypt, with tumors, with the scab, and with the itch, from which you cannot be healed.

28. Jehovah will strike you with madness and blindness and bewilderment of heart.

29. And you shall grope at noonday, as a blind man gropes in darkness; you shall not prosper in your ways; you shall be only oppressed and plundered all your days, and no one shall deliver you.

30. You shall betroth a wife, but another man shall lie with her; you shall build a house, but you shall not dwell in it; you shall plant a vineyard, but shall not begin to eat.

31. Your ox shall be slaughtered before your eyes, but you shall not eat of it; your donkey shall be violently taken away from before you, and shall not be restored to you; your sheep shall be given to your enemies, and you shall have no one to rescue them.

32. Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people, and your eyes shall look and fail with longing for them all day long; and there shall be no might in your hand.

33. A nation whom you have not known shall eat the fruit of your land and your produce, and you shall be only oppressed and crushed continually.

34. Thus you shall be driven mad because of the sight which your eyes see.

35. Jehovah will strike you in the knees and on the legs with severe boils which cannot be healed, and from the sole of your foot to the top of your head.

36. Jehovah will bring you and the king whom you set over you to a nation which neither you nor your fathers have known, and there you shall serve other gods; wood and stone.

37. And you shall become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword among all the nations where Jehovah shall drive you.

38. You shall carry much seed out to the field but gather little in, for the locust shall consume it.

39. You shall plant vineyards and tend them, but you shall neither drink of the wine nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat them.

40. You shall have olive trees throughout all your territory, but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for your olives shall drop off.

41. You shall beget sons and daughters, but they shall not be yours; for they shall go into captivity.

42. Locusts shall dispossess all your trees and the produce of your land.

43. The sojourners among you shall rise higher and higher above you, and you shall come down lower and lower.

44. He shall lend to you, but you shall not lend to him; he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.

45. Moreover all these curses shall come upon you and pursue and overtake you, until you are destroyed, because you did not obey the voice of Jehovah your God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which He has commanded you.

46. And they shall be upon you for a sign and a wonder, and upon your seed perpetually.

47. Because you did not serve Jehovah your God with joy and gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things,

48. therefore you shall serve your enemies, whom Jehovah will send against you, in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness, and in need of everything; and He will put a yoke of iron upon your neck until He has destroyed you.

49. Jehovah will bring a nation against you from afar, from the ends of the earth, as the eagle flies, a nation whose language you will not understand,

50. a nation of fierce countenance, which does not regard the face of the old nor show favor to the young.

51. And they shall eat the fruit of your livestock and the fruit of your land, until you are destroyed; they shall not leave you grain or new wine or oil, or the offspring of your cattle or the increase of your flocks, until they have destroyed you.

52. They shall besiege you at all your gates until your high and fortified walls, in which you trust, come down throughout all your land; and they shall besiege you at all your gates throughout all your land which Jehovah your God has given to you.

53. You shall eat the fruit of your own womb, the flesh of your sons and your daughters whom Jehovah your God has given to you, in the siege and desperate straits in which your enemies shall distress you.

54. The eye of the man who is tender and very delicate shall quiver with hostility toward his brother, toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the rest of his children whom he leaves behind,

55. so that he will not give to any of them the flesh of his children whom he shall eat, because he has nothing left in the siege and desperate straits in which your enemy shall distress you in all your gates.

56. The eye of the tender and dainty woman among you, who would not have ventured to set the sole of her foot on the ground because of her delicateness and tenderness, will quiver with hostility toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son and her daughter,

57. and toward her afterbirth which comes forth from between her feet and her children whom she bears; for she shall eat them secretly for lack of everything in the siege and desperate straits in which your enemy shall distress you in all your gates.

58. If you do not take heed to do all the Words of this Law that are written in this book, to fear this glorious and awesome name, JEHOVAH GOD,

59. then Jehovah will bring upon you and your seed extraordinary plagues; great and long lasting plagues; and evil long lasting sicknesses.

60. Moreover He will bring back upon you all the diseases of Egypt, of which you were afraid, and they shall cleave to you.

61. Also every sickness and every plague, which is not written in this Book of the Law, will Jehovah bring upon you to destroy you.

62. You shall be left few in number, whereas you were as the stars of heaven in multitude, because you would not obey the voice of Jehovah your God.

63. And it shall be, that just as Jehovah has rejoiced over you to do you good and multiply you, so Jehovah will rejoice over you to destroy you and annihilate you; and you shall be torn away from off the land which you are going in to possess.

64. And Jehovah will scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other, and there you shall serve other gods, which neither you nor your fathers have known; wood and stone.

65. And among those nations you shall find no rest, nor shall the sole of your foot have a resting place; but there Jehovah shall give you a trembling heart, failing eyes, and fainting soul.

66. Your life shall hang in doubt before you; you shall fear day and night, and have no assurance of life.

67. In the morning you shall say, Oh, that it were evening! And at evening you shall say, Oh, that it were morning! because of the fear which terrifies your heart, and because of the sight which your eyes see.

68. And Jehovah will take you back to Egypt in ships, by the way of which I had said to you, You shall never see it again. And there you shall have been sold to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.

## Deuteronomy 29

1. These are the words of the covenant which Jehovah commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which He had made with them in Horeb.

2. And Moses summoned all Israel and said to them: You have seen all that Jehovah has done before your eyes in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land;

3. the great trials which your eyes have seen, the signs, and those great wonders.

4. Yet Jehovah has not given you a heart to perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear, to this very day.

5. And I have led you forty years in the wilderness. Your clothes have not worn out on you, and your sandals have not worn out on your feet.

6. You have not eaten bread, nor have you drunk wine or strong drink, that you may know that I am Jehovah your God.

7. And when you came to this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out against us to battle, and we struck them.

8. We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh.

9. Therefore keep the Words of this covenant, and do them, that you may be wise in all that you do.

10. All of you are standing today before Jehovah your God: your heads, your tribes, your elders and your officials, all the men of Israel;

11. your little ones and your wives; and the sojourner who is in your camp, from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water;

12. to enter into the covenant with Jehovah your God, and into His oath, which Jehovah your God is making with you today,

13. to establish you today as a people for Himself, to be, Himself, your God, just as He has spoken to you, and as He has sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

14. I am making this covenant and this oath, not only with you,

15. but with him who stands here with us today before Jehovah our God, as well as with him who is not here with us today

16. (for you know that we dwelt in the land of Egypt and that we came through the nations which you passed by,

17. and you saw their abominations and their idols among them of wood and stone and silver and gold);

18. so that there not be among you man or woman or family or tribe, whose heart turns away today from Jehovah our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations, and that there not be among you a root bearing venom or bitterness;

19. and so it not happen, when he hears the words of this curse, that he has blessed himself in his heart, thinking, I shall have peace, even though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart; and thus to snatch away the watered with the thirsty.

20. Jehovah will not consent to forgive him; for then the anger of Jehovah and His jealousy shall smoke against that man, and every curse that is written in this book shall lie down upon him, and Jehovah shall blot out his name from under the heavens.

21. And Jehovah shall separate him from all the tribes of Israel for evil, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this Book of the Law,

22. so that your children of the generations to come, who rise up after you, and the foreigner who comes from a distant land, when they see the plagues of that land and the sicknesses which Jehovah has laid upon it, shall utter:

23. The whole land is brimstone, salt, and burning; it is not sown, nor does it sprout, nor does any grass grow there, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which Jehovah overthrew in His anger and His wrath.

24. And all the nations shall say, Why has Jehovah done thus unto this land? What is the meaning of this great burning anger?

25. Then people shall say: Because they have forsaken the covenant of Jehovah the God of their fathers, which He had made with them to bring them out of the land of Egypt;

26. for they went and served other gods and bowed down to them, gods that they had not known and that He had not apportioned to them.

27. And the anger of Jehovah burned against this land, to bring upon it every curse that is written in this Book.

28. And Jehovah uprooted them from their land in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.

29. Jehovah our God hides Himself; but reveals Himself to us and to our children forever, to do all the Words of this Law.

## Deuteronomy 30

1. And it shall come to pass, when all these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse which I have set before you, and you call them to mind among all the nations where Jehovah your God has thrust you away,

2. and you return to Jehovah your God and obey His voice, according to all that I am commanding you today, you and your children, with all your heart and with all your soul,

3. that Jehovah your God will bring you back from captivity, and have compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all the nations where Jehovah your God has scattered you.

4. If you are thrust out to the ends of the heavens, from there Jehovah your God will gather you, and from there He will fetch you.

5. And Jehovah your God will bring you into the land which your fathers had possessed and you had possessed. He will prosper you and multiply you more than your fathers.

6. And Jehovah your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your seed, to love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live.

7. And Jehovah your God will put all these curses upon your enemies and upon those who were hating you, who had persecuted you.

8. And you shall return and obey the voice of Jehovah and do all His commandments which I am commanding you today.

9. Jehovah your God will make you abound in every work of your hand, in the fruit of your womb, in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your land for good. For Jehovah will again rejoice over you for good, as He has rejoiced over your fathers,

10. if you obey the voice of Jehovah your God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which are written in this Book of the Law, and if you turn to Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul.

11. For this commandment which I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you to understand, nor is it far off.

12. It is not in the heavens, for you to think: Who shall ascend into the heavens for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?

13. Nor is it beyond the sea, for you to think: Who shall go over the sea for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?

14. But the Word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it.

15. Behold, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil;

16. in that I am commanding you today to love Jehovah your God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments, His statutes, and His judgments, that you may live and multiply; and Jehovah your God will bless you in the land which you are going in to possess.

17. But if your heart turns away so that you will not obey, and have drawn away, and bowed down to other gods and served them,

18. I have declared to you today that you shall be exterminated to perish; you shall not prolong your days in the land which you are crossing over the Jordan to go in and possess.

19. I call Heaven and earth to bear witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. Therefore choose life, that both you and your seed may live;

20. to love Jehovah your God, to obey His voice, and to cleave unto Him, for He is your life and the length of your days; to dwell in the land which Jehovah has sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give it to them.

## Deuteronomy 31

1. And Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.

2. And he said to them: I am one hundred and twenty years old today. I can no longer go out and come in. And Jehovah has said to me, You shall not cross over this Jordan.

3. Jehovah your God Himself is crossing over before you; He will destroy these nations before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua himself is crossing over before you, as Jehovah has spoken.

4. And Jehovah will do to them as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites and their land, when He destroyed them.

5. Jehovah will give them up before you, to do to them according to all the commandments which I have commanded you.

6. Be strong and of good courage, do not fear nor be afraid of them; for Jehovah your God, He is the One who is going with you. He will not abandon you nor forsake you.

7. And Moses called to Joshua and said to him in the eyes of all Israel, Be strong and of good courage, for you shall go with this people into the land which Jehovah has sworn to their fathers to give to them, and you shall cause them to inherit it.

8. And Jehovah, He is going before you. He will be with you; He will not abandon you nor forsake you. Do not fear nor be dismayed.

9. And Moses wrote this Law and delivered it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and to all the elders of Israel.

10. And Moses commanded them, saying: At the end of every seven years, at the appointed time in the year of release, at the Feast of Booths,

11. when all Israel comes to appear before Jehovah your God in the place which He chooses, you shall read this Law before all Israel in their ears.

12. Gather the people together, men and women and little ones, and the sojourner who is within your gates, that they may hear and that they may learn to fear Jehovah your God and take heed to do all the Words of this Law,

13. and that their children, who have not known it, may hear and learn to fear Jehovah your God all the days you live in the land which you are crossing the Jordan to possess.

14. And Jehovah said to Moses, Behold, the day has drawn near for you to die. Summon Joshua, and present yourselves at the tent of meeting, that I may commission him. And Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting.

15. And Jehovah appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood above the door of the tent.

16. And Jehovah said to Moses: Behold, you shall rest with your fathers; and this people will rise up and commit adultery with the gods of the foreigners of the land, where they are going in to be among them, and they will forsake Me and break My covenant which I have made with them.

17. And My anger will burn against them in that day, and I shall forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured. And many evils and troubles shall befall them, so that they will say in that day, Have not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?

18. And I will conceal to hide My face in that day because of all the evil which they have done, in that they have turned to other gods.

19. Now therefore, write down this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel; put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for Me against the children of Israel.

20. When I have brought them to the land flowing with milk and honey, of which I have sworn to their fathers, and they have eaten and filled themselves and grown fat, then they will have turned to other gods and served them; and they will have provoked Me and broken My covenant.

21. And it shall be, when many evils and troubles find them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten in the mouths of their seed, for I know the imagination of their works even today, even before I bring them into the land of which I have sworn to give to them.

22. Therefore Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children of Israel.

23. And He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, Be strong and of good courage; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land of which I have sworn to them, and I shall be with you.

24. So it was, when Moses had completed writing the words of this Law in a book, when they were finished,

25. that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, saying:

26. Take this Book of the Law, and put it inside the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, to be there as a witness against you;

27. for I know your rebellion and your stiff neck. If today, while I am yet alive with you, you have been rebellious against Jehovah, then how much more after my death?

28. Gather to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears and call Heaven and earth to testify against them.

29. For I know that after my death you will pervert yourselves to corruption, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days, because you will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, to provoke Him to anger through the work of your hands.

30. And Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song to their conclusion:

## Deuteronomy 32

1. Give ear, O Heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.

2. Let my teaching drop as the rain, my speech distill as the dew, as raindrops on the tender herb, and as showers upon the grass.

3. For I proclaim the name of Jehovah; ascribe greatness to our God.

4. He is the Rock, His work is perfect; for all His ways are justice, a Mighty God of truth and without injustice; righteous and upright is He.

5. They have corrupted themselves; they are not His children, because of their blemish: a perverse and crooked generation.

6. Do you deal thus with Jehovah, O foolish and unwise people? Is He not your Father, who bought you? Has He not made you and established you?

7. Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations. Ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will say to you:

8. When the Most High divided their inheritance to the nations, when He separated the sons of Adam, He set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel.

9. For Jehovahs portion is His people; Jacob is the allotment of His inheritance.

10. He found him in a desert land and in the wasteland, a howling wilderness; He encircled him, He instructed him, He kept him as the pupil of His eye.

11. As an eagle stirs up its nest, hovers over its young, spreading out its wings, taking them up, carrying them on its wings,

12. so Jehovah alone led him, and there was no foreign god with him.

13. He made him ride in the heights of the earth, that he might eat the produce of the fields; He made him suck honey from the rock, and oil from the rock of flint;

14. butter from the cattle, and milk of the flock, with fat of lambs; and rams of the sons of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of wheat; and you drank wine, the blood of the grapes.

15. But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked; you grew fat, you grew thick, you are gorged! And he forsook the God who had made him, and treated with contempt the Rock of his salvation.

16. They provoked Him to jealousy with strange gods; with abominations they provoked Him to anger.

17. They sacrificed to demons, not to God, to gods they had not known, to new gods come lately, that your fathers had not feared.

18. Of the Rock who begot you, you are unmindful, and have forgotten the Mighty God who brought you forth.

19. And when Jehovah saw it, He spurned them, because of the provocation of His sons and His daughters.

20. And He said, I will hide My face from them, I will see what their end will be, for they are a perverse generation, children in whom is no faithfulness.

21. They have provoked Me to jealousy by what is not the Mighty God; they have moved Me to anger by their vanities. So I will provoke them to jealousy by those who are not a people; I will move them to anger by a foolish nation.

22. For a fire has been kindled in my anger, and shall burn to the lowest Sheol; it shall consume the earth with her produce, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.

23. I will heap evil upon them; I will use up My arrows upon them.

24. They shall be wasted with hunger, devoured by burning heat and bitter destruction; I will also send against them the teeth of beasts, with the poison of the serpents of the dust.

25. The sword from outside, and the terror from within, shall bereave the young man and virgin, the nursing child and the man of gray hairs.

26. I have said, I will dash them in pieces, I will bring to an end the memory of them from among men,

27. had I not feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should misunderstand, lest they should say, our hand is high; and Jehovah has not done all this.

28. For they are a nation void of counsel, nor is there any understanding in them.

29. Oh, that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!

30. How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and Jehovah had delivered them up?

31. For their rock is not like our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.

32. For their vine is of the vine of Sodom and of the fields of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter.

33. Their wine is the poison of serpents, and the cruel venom of vipers.

34. Is this not laid up in store with Me, sealed up among My treasures?

35. Vengeance is Mine, and recompense; their foot shall slip in due time; for the day of their calamity is near, and the things prepared have made haste upon them.

36. For Jehovah will judge His people and have compassion on His servants, when He sees that their power is gone, and there is no one remaining, bond or free.

37. He will say, Where are their gods, the rock in which they sought refuge?

38. Who ate the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you, and be your refuge.

39. See now that I, even I, am He, and there is no God besides Me; I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal; nor is there any who can deliver out of My hand.

40. For I raise My hand to the heavens, and say, As I live forever,

41. if I whet My glittering sword, and My hand takes hold on judgment, I will render vengeance to My enemies, and repay those who hate Me.

42. I will make My arrows drunk with blood, and My sword shall devour flesh, with the blood of the slain and the captives, from the heads of the commanders of the enemy.

43. Rejoice, O nations, with His people; for He will avenge the blood of His servants, and render vengeance to His adversaries; He will provide atonement for His land and His people.

44. And Moses came with Joshua the son of Nun and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people.

45. And Moses finished speaking all these words to all Israel,

46. and He said to them: Set your hearts on all the words which I am testifying against you today, that you command your children to take heed to do all the Words of this Law.

47. For these are not empty words to you, for it is your life; and by this Word you shall prolong your days in the land where you are crossing over the Jordan to possess.

48. And Jehovah spoke to Moses that same day, saying:

49. Go up into this mountain of Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, across from Jericho; view the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel as a possession;

50. and die on the mountain which you ascend, and be gathered to your people, even as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people;

51. because you have trespassed against Me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin, because you did not honor Me in the midst of the children of Israel.

52. Yet you shall see the land before you, though you shall not go there, into the land which I am giving to the children of Israel.

## Deuteronomy 33

1. Now this is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.

2. And he said: Jehovah has come from Sinai, and dawned on them from Seir; He has shone forth from Mount Paran, and He has come with ten thousands of saints; from His right hand a fiery Law for them.

3. Yes, He loves the people; all His saints are in Your hand; they sit down at Your feet; everyone receives Your Words.

4. Moses has commanded a Law for us, a heritage for the congregation of Jacob.

5. And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people were gathered, all the tribes of Israel together.

6. Let Reuben live, and not die, and let his men be numbered.

7. And this he said of Judah: Hear, Jehovah, the voice of Judah, and bring him to his people; let his hands be sufficient for him, and may You be a help against his enemies.

8. And of Levi he said: Let Your Thummim and Your Urim be with Your Godly man, whom You tested at Massah, and with whom You contended at the waters of Meribah;

9. who says of his father and mother, I have not seen them; nor has he acknowledged his brothers, or known his own children; for they have kept Your Word and guarded Your covenant.

10. They shall teach Jacob Your judgments, and Israel Your Law. They shall put incense before Your nose, and a whole burnt offering upon Your altar.

11. Bless his strength, O Jehovah, and accept the work of his hands; strike the loins of those who rise against him, and of those who hate him, that they rise not again.

12. Of Benjamin he said: The beloved of Jehovah shall dwell in safety by Him, who shelters him all the day long; and he shall dwell between His shoulders.

13. And of Joseph he said: Blessed of Jehovah is his land, with the excellence of the heavens, with the dew, and the deep lying beneath,

14. with the excellent yield of the sun, with the excellent produce of the months,

15. with the chief things of the ancient mountains, with the excellence of the enduring hills,

16. with the excellence of the earth and its fullness, and the favor of Him who dwelt in the bush; let it come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the head of him who was separated from his brothers.

17. His glory is like a firstborn bull, and his horns like the horns of the oryx; together with them He shall thrust the peoples to the ends of the earth; they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.

18. And of Zebulun he said: Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, and Issachar in your tents!

19. They shall call the peoples to the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness; for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and of treasures hidden in the sand.

20. And of Gad he said: Blessed is he who enlarges Gad; he dwells as a lion, and tears the arm and the crown of the head.

21. He saw the first part for himself, because a lawgivers portion was reserved there. He came with the heads of the people; he has administered the justice of Jehovah, and His judgments with Israel.

22. And of Dan he said: Dan is a lions whelp; he shall leap from Bashan.

23. And of Naphtali he said: O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full of the blessing of Jehovah, possess the west and the south.

24. And of Asher he said: Asher is most blessed of sons; let him be acceptable to his brothers, and let him dip his foot in oil.

25. Your sandals shall be iron and bronze; as your days, so your strength.

26. There is no one like the Mighty God of Jeshurun, riding the Heavens for your help, and in His majesty upon the clouds.

27. The God of old is your refuge, and underneath are the eternal arms. He will thrust out the enemy before you, and say, Destroy!

28. And Israel shall dwell alone in safety, the fountain of Jacob in a land of grain and new wine; his heavens shall also drop dew.

29. Blessed are you, O Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by Jehovah, the shield of your help and the sword of your majesty! Your enemies shall cower before you, and you shall tread down their high places.

## Deuteronomy 34

1. And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is across from Jericho. And Jehovah showed him all the land of Gilead as far as Dan,

2. all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the western Sea,

3. the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar.

4. And Jehovah said to him, This is the land of which I have sworn to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, I will give it to your seed. I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not cross over there.

5. So Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moab, according to the mouth of Jehovah.

6. And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth Peor; but no one knows his grave to this day.

7. Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died. His eyes had not dimmed nor had his natural vigor abated.

8. And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days. And the days of weeping and mourning for Moses ended.

9. And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the Spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him; so the children of Israel heeded him, and did as Jehovah had commanded Moses.

10. And since then there has not arisen in Israel a prophet like Moses, whom Jehovah knew face to face,

11. in all the signs and wonders which Jehovah had sent him to do in the land of Egypt, before Pharaoh, before all his servants, and in all his land,

12. and by all the mighty hand and all the great terror which Moses had done in the eyes of all Israel.
