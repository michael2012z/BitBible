## Micah 1

1. The Word of Jehovah that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem:

2. Hear, all you people. Take heed, O earth, and all the fullness of it. And let the Lord Jehovah be a witness against you, the Lord from His holy temple.

3. For behold, Jehovah is coming out of His place, and He will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth.

4. And the mountains shall melt under Him, and the valleys shall burst open, as wax before the fire, as waters poured out on a steep place.

5. All this is against the transgression of Jacob, and against the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria. And what are the high places of Judah? Are they not Jerusalem.

6. Therefore I will make Samaria into a ruinous heap of the field, places for planting a vineyard. And I will pour down her stones into the valley, and I will uncover her foundations.

7. And all her carved images shall be beaten to pieces, and all her wages of harlotry shall be burned with fire. And I will make all her idols a desolation. For she gathered it from the wages of a harlot, and they shall return to the wages of a harlot.

8. Therefore I will wail and howl; I will go stripped and naked; I will make a wailing like the jackals, and mourning like the daughters of the owl.

9. For her wounds are incurable; for it has come to Judah; it has reached to the gate of my people, to Jerusalem.

10. Do not declare it in Gath; do not weep and wail. In Beth Aphrah roll and wallow in dust.

11. Pass over, you inhabitant of Shaphir, having your shame naked. The inhabitant of Zaanan has not gone out; Beth Ezel mourns; its standing place is taken from you.

12. For the inhabitant of Maroth waited anxiously for good, but evil came down from Jehovah to the gate of Jerusalem.

13. O inhabitant of Lachish, harness the chariot to the swift steeds; she is the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion, for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.

14. Therefore you shall give parting gifts to Moresheth Gath. The houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.

15. Yet I will bring an heir to you, O inhabitant of Mareshah. The glory of Israel shall come unto Adullam.

16. Make yourself bald, and cut off your hair for your dainty children. Enlarge your baldness like the eagle, for they have gone from you into exile.

## Micah 2

1. Woe to those who devise wickedness and do evil on their beds! In the morning light they practice it, because it is in the power of their hand.

2. And they covet and seize fields and houses, and carry them away. And they oppress a man and his household, even a man and his inheritance.

3. Therefore thus says Jehovah: Behold, I am devising evil against this family, from which you shall not remove your necks; nor shall you walk haughtily, for this is an evil time.

4. In that day one shall take up a parable against you and wail a mournful lamentation, saying, We are devastated in utter ruin. He has changed the possession of my people. How He has removed it from me! To the turncoat He has divided the fields.

5. Therefore you will not have one to cast a measuring line by lot in the assembly of Jehovah.

6. Do not prophesy as you prophesy, you say. So they shall not prophesy to you; they shall not take away reproaches.

7. You who are named House of Jacob, is the Spirit of Jehovah limited? Are these His doings? Do not My Words do good to the one who walks uprightly?

8. Even recently My people have risen up like an enemy. You strip off an inner robe before an outer garment, from those who pass by securely, as those returning from war.

9. You have thrown the women of My people out from their pleasant houses; you have taken away My honor forever from their children.

10. Rise up and depart. This is not your rest, for it is unclean. It shall destroy with grievous destruction.

11. If a man walks with a spirit of deception and lies saying, I will prophesy to you for wine and for strong drink, he shall even be a prophet for this people.

12. I will collect and gather all of you, O Jacob; I will collect and gather the remnant of Israel. I will set them together like the sheep of the fold, like a flock in the middle of their pasture. They shall be in commotion because of the multitude of people.

13. The one who breaks through comes before them; they break through and pass through the gate and go out by it. And their king shall pass before them, and Jehovah at their head.

## Micah 3

1. And I said, Hear now, O heads of Jacob, and you rulers of the house of Israel; is it not for you to know justice.

2. You who hate good and love evil, who tear their skin off them, and their flesh from off their bones;

3. who also eat the flesh of My people, and flay their skin off from them; and they break their bones and chop them in pieces as for the pot, and as flesh in the kettle.

4. Then they shall cry out to Jehovah, but He will not answer them. He will even hide His face from them at that time, because they have done evil in their doings.

5. Thus says Jehovah concerning the prophets who mislead My people, who bite with their teeth and call out, Peace! And whoever does not put anything into their mouth, they even prepare a war against him.

6. Therefore the night shall be to you without vision; and darkness without divining. And the sun shall go down on the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.

7. And the seers shall be ashamed, and the diviners confounded, all of them; yea, they shall cover their mustache, for there is no answer from God.

8. But by the Spirit of Jehovah I am full of power and justice and might, to declare to Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.

9. Now hear this, you heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, you who abhor justice and pervert all equity,

10. who build up Zion with blood and Jerusalem with iniquity:

11. Her heads judge for a bribe, and her priests teach for pay, and her prophets divine for money; yet they lean on Jehovah, saying, Is not Jehovah among us? No evil can come upon us.

12. Therefore, on account of you, Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house like the high places of the forest.

## Micah 4

1. But it shall be in the latter days, that the mountain of the house of Jehovah shall be established on the top of the mountains; and it shall be lifted up above the hills; and peoples shall flow to it.

2. And many nations shall come and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of the God of Jacob. And He will teach us His ways, and we will walk in His paths. For the Law shall go forth out of Zion, and the Word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.

3. And He shall judge between many peoples, and will decide for strong nations afar off. And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, nor shall they learn war any more.

4. But they shall each one sit under his vine and under his fig tree, and there shall be no cause for trembling. For the mouth of Jehovah of Hosts has spoken.

5. For all the peoples walk, each one in the name of his god; but we will walk in the name of Jehovah our God forever and ever.

6. In that day I will gather the lame, declares Jehovah, and I will gather the banished, and the ones I have afflicted.

7. And I will establish the lame in a place as a remnant, and her who was cast off into a strong nation. And Jehovah shall reign over them in Mount Zion from now on, even forever.

8. And you, O tower of the flock, the stronghold of the daughter of Zion, it shall come to you. And the rule of the chief ones shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.

9. Now why do you cry aloud with an outcry? Is there no king among you? Has your adviser perished? For pangs have seized you like one in travail.

10. Writhe in pain and bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like one giving birth. For now you shall go out from the city, and you shall live in the field. And you shall go to Babylon. There you shall be delivered. There Jehovah shall redeem you from the hand of your enemies.

11. Now also many nations are gathered against you, saying, Let her be defiled, and let our eyes look upon Zion.

12. But they do not know the purposes of Jehovah, nor do they understand His counsel. For He will gather them like the sheaves to the threshing floor.

13. Rise up and thresh, O daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hooves bronze, and you shall crush many peoples. And I will consecrate their gain to Jehovah, and their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth.

## Micah 5

1. Now gather yourself together in troops, O daughter of troops; he has laid siege against us. They shall strike the Judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek.

2. And you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are insignificant among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall come forth to Me the One to be Ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from the days of eternity.

3. Therefore He will give them up until the time the one giving birth has given birth. Then the remnant of His brothers shall return to the sons of Israel.

4. And He shall stand and feed His flock in the strength of Jehovah, in the majesty of the name of Jehovah His God. And they shall dwell, for now He shall be great to the ends of the earth.

5. And this shall be peace. When Assyria shall come into our land, and when he shall tread in our palaces, then we shall raise against him seven shepherds and eight anointed men.

6. And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod at the entrances. Thus He shall deliver us from Assyria, when he comes into our land, and when he treads within our borders.

7. And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples as dew from Jehovah, as showers on the grass, which does not wait for man, nor delay for the sons of men.

8. And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who both tramples and tears in pieces if he passes through, and there is no one to deliver.

9. Your hands shall be raised against your foes, and all your enemies shall be cut off.

10. And it shall be in that day, that I will cut off your horses out of your midst, and I will destroy your chariots, declares Jehovah.

11. And I will cut off the cities of your land and tear down all your fortresses.

12. And I will cut off sorceries out of your hand, and there shall not be any more conjurers.

13. And I will also cut off your graven images and your pillars from your midst. And you shall no more bow down to the work of your hands.

14. And I will pluck your groves from your midst, and I will destroy your cities.

15. And I will execute vengeance in anger and in fury on the nations, such as they have not heard.

## Micah 6

1. Hear now what Jehovah says: Rise up, contend with the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice.

2. Mountains, and you enduring foundations of the earth, hear the contention of Jehovah, for Jehovah has a quarrel with His people, and He will argue with Israel.

3. O My people, what have I done to you? And how have I made you weary? Testify against Me.

4. For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house of bondage; and I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam before you.

5. My people, remember now what Balak, king of Moab, counseled; and what Balaam, the son of Beor, answered him from Shittim to Gilgal, so that you may know the righteousness of Jehovah.

6. With what shall I come before Jehovah, to bow myself before the loftiness of God? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with yearling calves?

7. Will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

8. O man, He has declared to you what is good. And what does Jehovah require of you, but to do justice, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.

9. The voice of Jehovah cries out to the city; and one of sound wisdom will see Your name. Hear the staff, and Him who appointed it.

10. Are there yet in the house of the wicked the treasures of wickedness, and the abominable short ephah?

11. Shall I declare to be pure the wicked balances, or the bag of deceitful weight stones?

12. For her rich ones are full of violence, and her inhabitants speak lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.

13. Therefore I also will make you sick by striking you, making you desolate because of your sins.

14. You shall eat, but not be satisfied, and your emptiness shall be in your midst; and you will move back, but shall not be safe; and that which you rescue, I will give to the sword.

15. You shall sow, but you shall not reap; you shall tread the olive, but you shall not anoint yourselves with oil; and new wine, but shall not drink wine.

16. For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab. And you walk in their counsels, so that I may make you a desolation, and your inhabitants a hissing. And you shall bear the reproach of My people.

## Micah 7

1. Woe is me! For I am like the gatherings of summer fruit, like the gleanings of the vintage. There is no cluster to eat; my soul desires the first-ripe fruit.

2. The good man has perished from the earth, and there is no one upright among mankind. All of them lie in wait for blood; each one hunts his brother with a net.

3. Both hands are on evil, to do it well. Both the ruler and the judge ask for a bribe. And the great one speaks the lust of his soul; and they weave it together.

4. The best of them is like a thorn; the upright more than a hedge of thorns. The day of your watchman and your punishment comes; now shall be their perplexity.

5. Put no faith in a companion; put no trust in a friend; keep the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your bosom;

6. for the son dishonors the father; the daughter rises up against her mother; the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a mans enemies are the men of his own house.

7. But I will look to Jehovah; I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me.

8. Do not rejoice against me, O my enemy; for if I fall, I shall arise. For if I sit in darkness, Jehovah is a light to me.

9. I will bear the indignation of Jehovah because I have sinned against Him, until He pleads my case and executes justice for me. He will bring me forth to the light; I shall see His righteousness.

10. And my enemy shall see; and shame shall cover her who said to me, Where is Jehovah your God? My eyes shall see her. Now she shall be trampled down as the mud of the streets.

11. In the day your walls are to be built, in that day the decree shall be far removed.

12. In that day they shall come to you from Assyria and the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the River, and from sea to sea, and mountain to mountain.

13. But the land shall become desolate because of those who dwell in it, from the fruit of their doings.

14. Shepherd Your people with Your rod, the flock of Your possession, who dwell alone in the woodland, in the midst of Carmel. Let them graze in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.

15. As in the days when you came out from the land of Egypt, I will show them marvelous things.

16. The nations shall see and be put to shame for all their might. They shall lay their hand over their mouth; their ears shall be deaf.

17. They shall lick the dust like a snake; they shall tremble out from their holes like ones that shrink back into the earth; they shall dread Jehovah our God; they shall fear because of You.

18. Who is a Mighty God like You, forgiving iniquity and passing over the transgression of the remnant of His possession? His anger does not remain strong forever, for He delights in mercy.

19. He will return and have compassion on us; He will subdue our iniquities. And You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.

20. You will give faithfulness to Jacob, goodness to Abraham, which You have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.
