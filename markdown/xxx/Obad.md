# Obadiah

## Obadiah 1

1. The vision of Obadiah: Thus says the Lord Jehovah concerning Edom: We have heard a report from Jehovah, and a messenger is sent among the nations; rise up, and let us rise up against her for battle.

2. Behold, I have made you small among the nations; you are greatly despised.

3. The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who dwell in the clefts of the rock; whose dwelling is high, saying in your heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?

4. Though you rise as high as the eagle, and though you set your nest among the stars, I will bring you down from there, declares Jehovah.

5. If thieves had come to you, if robbers by night (O, how you will be cut off!), would they not have stolen until they had enough? If the grape-gatherers came to you, would they not leave gleanings?

6. O, how Esau is searched out! His hidden things are sought out!

7. All the men of your covenant have sent you away to the border. The men who were at peace with you have deceived you and have prevailed against you. They are setting your bread as a trap under you; no one is aware of it.

8. Shall I not in that day even destroy the wise out of Edom and understanding out of the mountains of Esau? declares Jehovah.

9. And your mighty ones, O Teman, shall be afraid, so that each man from the mountains of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.

10. Shame shall cover you because of your violence against your brother Jacob, and you shall be cut off forever.

11. In the day that you stood on the other side, in the day that strangers took captive his forces, and foreigners entered his gates, and cast lots for Jerusalem, even you were as one of them.

12. But you should not have looked on the day of your brother, on the day of his destruction; nor should you have rejoiced over the sons of Judah in the day of their destruction; nor should you have spoken proudly in the day of distress.

13. You should not have entered into My peoples gate in the day of his calamity; also you should not have looked on his evil in the day of his calamity, nor should you have sent away his forces in the day of his calamity.

14. Nor should you have stood at the crossroads to cut off those of him who escaped, nor should you have delivered up his survivors to prison in the day of distress.

15. For the day of Jehovah is near upon all the nations: As you have done, it shall be done to you; your recompense shall return upon your own head.

16. For as you have drunk on My holy mountain, so shall all the nations continually drink. Yea, they shall drink and shall swallow; and they shall be as though they had never been.

17. But on Mount Zion there shall be deliverance, and it shall be holy. And the house of Jacob shall possess their own possessions.

18. And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble. And they shall burn among them and consume them. And there shall be no survivor to the house of Esau, for Jehovah has spoken.

19. And those from the south shall possess the mountain of Esau, and the low lands of the Philistines. And they shall possess the fields of Ephraim and Samaria. And Benjamin shall possess Gilead.

20. And the captives of this host of the sons of Israel shall possess the land of the Canaanites to Zarephath; even the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad shall possess the cities of the south.

21. And deliverers shall go up into Mount Zion to judge the mountain of Esau, and the kingdom shall be Jehovahs.
