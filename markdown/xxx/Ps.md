# Psalms

## Psalms 1

1. Blessed is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked, nor has stood in the way of sinners, nor has sat in the seat of the scornful.

2. But his delight is in the Law of Jehovah; and in His Law he meditates day and night.

3. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that brings forth its fruit in its season, and its leaf shall not wither, and all that he does shall prosper.

4. The wicked are not so, but are like chaff which the wind drives away.

5. Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

6. For Jehovah knows the way of the righteous; but the way of the wicked shall perish.

## Psalms 2

1. Why do the nations rage, and the peoples devise a vain thing?

2. The kings of the earth take their stand, and the rulers take counsel together, against Jehovah and against His anointed, saying,

3. Let us break and tear away their bonds, and cast away their cords from us.

4. He who sits in the Heavens shall laugh; Jehovah shall have them in derision.

5. Then He shall speak to them in His anger, and terrify them in His wrath.

6. Yet, I have set My King on My holy hill of Zion.

7. I will declare the decree: Jehovah has said unto Me, You are My Son; today I have begotten You.

8. Ask of Me, and I will give the nations for Your inheritance, and the ends of the earth for Your possession.

9. You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them in pieces like a potterÂ’s vessel.

10. And now be wise, O kings; be instructed, you judges of the earth.

11. Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

12. Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and you perish from the way, when His wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all those who put their trust in Him.

## Psalms 3

__A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom.__

1. O Jehovah, how my adversaries have increased! Many are they who rise up against me.

2. Many are saying of my soul, There is no deliverance for him in God. Selah.

3. But You, O Jehovah, are a shield for me; my glory, the One who lifts up my head.

4. I cried unto Jehovah with my voice, and He heard me out of His holy hill. Selah.

5. I lay down and slept. I awoke, for Jehovah sustained me.

6. I am not afraid of ten thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around.

7. Arise, O Jehovah; deliver me, O my God; for You have struck all my enemies on the cheekbone. You have broken the teeth of the wicked.

8. Salvation belongs to Jehovah. Your blessing is on Your people. Selah.

## Psalms 4

__To the Chief Musician. Neginoth. A Psalm of David.__

1. Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have enlarged me in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.

2. O you sons of men, how long will you turn My glory into shame? Will you love vanity and seek after falsehood? Selah.

3. But know that Jehovah has set apart the godly for Himself. Jehovah hears when I call unto Him.

4. Tremble, and sin not; commune within your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.

5. Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and trust in Jehovah.

6. There are many who say, Who will show us any good? Jehovah, lift up the light of Your countenance upon us.

7. You have put gladness in my heart, more than during the time when their grain and their wine increased.

8. I will both lie down in peace, and sleep; for You alone, Jehovah, make me dwell in safety.

## Psalms 5

__To the Chief Musician. Nehiloth. A Psalm of David.__

1. Give ear to my words, O Jehovah; consider my meditation.

2. Give attention to the voice of my cry, my King and my God; for unto You will I pray.

3. My voice shall You hear in the morning, O Jehovah; in the morning I will direct my prayer unto You, and I will look up.

4. For You are not a Mighty God that delights in wickedness; nor shall evil dwell with You.

5. The boastful shall not stand in Your sight. You hate all doers of iniquity.

6. You shall destroy those who speak lies; Jehovah abhors the man of blood and treachery.

7. But as for me, I will come into Your house in the abundance of Your mercy; I will bow down in Your fear toward Your holy temple.

8. Lead me, O Jehovah, in Your righteousness, because of my enemies; make Your way straight before my face.

9. For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is destruction; their throat is an open grave; they flatter with their tongue.

10. Declare them guilty, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions, for they have rebelled against You.

11. But let all those who put their trust in You rejoice; let them always shout for joy, because You defend them. And let those who love Your name be joyful in You.

12. For You, O Jehovah, will bless the righteous; with favor You will surround him as with a shield.

## Psalms 6

__To the Chief Musician. Sheminith. A Psalm of David.__

1. O Jehovah, rebuke me not in Your anger, nor chasten me in Your fury.

2. Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah, for I am weak; O Jehovah, heal me, for my bones are anxious.

3. My soul also is exceedingly anxious; but You, O Jehovah, how long?

4. Return, O Jehovah, rescue my soul! Deliver me because of Your goodness!

5. For in death there is no remembrance of You; in Sheol who will give thanks to You?

6. I am weary from my groaning; all night I make my bed swim; I dissolve my couch with my tears.

7. My eye has wasted away because of grief; it has grown weak because of all my enemies.

8. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity; for Jehovah has heard the voice of my weeping.

9. Jehovah has heard my supplication; Jehovah will receive my prayer.

10. Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly dismayed; let them turn back and be ashamed in a moment.

## Psalms 7

__A song of David, which he sang to Jehovah, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite.__

1. O Jehovah my God, in You I put my trust; deliver me from all those who pursue me, and rescue me,

2. lest they tear my soul like a lion, tearing it in pieces, and there is no one to rescue.

3. O Jehovah my God, if I have done this: if there is iniquity in my hands;

4. if I have repaid evil to one who was at peace with me, or if I have plundered my enemy without cause;

5. let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it; yea, let him trample down my life upon the earth and lay my honor in the dust. Selah.

6. Arise, O Jehovah, in Your anger; lift up Yourself because of the rage of my enemies, and arouse Yourself for me to the judgment which You have commanded.

7. Thus the congregation of the people shall surround You; for their sakes, therefore, return on high.

8. Jehovah shall judge the people; judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and according to my integrity within me.

9. O let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish the just. For the righteous God tries the hearts and minds.

10. My defense is from God, who saves the upright in heart.

11. God judges the righteous, and the Mighty God is angry with the wicked every day.

12. If he does not turn back, He will sharpen His sword; He has bent His bow and made it ready.

13. He has also prepared instruments of death for him; He makes His arrows hotly pursue.

14. Behold, he writhes in iniquity, and has conceived trouble, and has brought forth falsehood.

15. He has excavated a cistern and dug it, and has fallen into the pit which he made.

16. His trouble shall return upon his own head, and his violence shall come down upon his own crown.

17. I will praise Jehovah according to His righteousness, and will sing praise to the name of Jehovah Most High.

## Psalms 8

__To the Chief Musician. Gittith. A Psalm of David.__

1. O Jehovah our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth! You have set Your glory above the heavens!

2. Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings You have ordained strength, because of Your enemies, that You might remove the enemy and the avenger.

3. When I look at Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars which You have established;

4. what is man that You are mindful of him, and the son of man that You visit him?

5. For You have made him lacking a little from God, and have crowned him with glory and honor.

6. You made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet:

7. all sheep and oxen, even the beasts of the field;

8. the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea passing through the paths of the seas.

9. O Jehovah, our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth!

## Psalms 9

__To the Chief Musician. Muthlabben. A Psalm of David.__

1. I will praise You, O Jehovah, with my whole heart; I will tell of all Your marvelous works.

2. I will be glad and rejoice in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.

3. When my enemies have turned back, they shall fall and perish at Your presence.

4. For You have maintained my right and my cause; You sat on the throne judging in righteousness.

5. You have rebuked the nations, You have destroyed the wicked, You have blotted out their name forever and ever.

6. The desolations of the enemy have come to an end forever, and You have destroyed the cities; the remembrance of them has perished with them.

7. But Jehovah shall endure forever; He has prepared His throne for justice.

8. And He shall judge the world in righteousness; He shall execute judgment to the people with equity.

9. Jehovah also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of distress.

10. And those who know Your name will put their trust in You; for You, Jehovah, have not forsaken those who seek You.

11. Sing praises to Jehovah, who dwells in Zion; declare His deeds among the nations.

12. When He investigates bloodshed, He forgets not the cry of the lowly.

13. Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; look upon my affliction from those who hate me, You who lift me up from the gates of death,

14. so that I may declare all Your praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion. I will rejoice in Your salvation.

15. The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made; their own foot is caught in the net which they hid.

16. Jehovah is known. He has executed judgment; the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.

17. The wicked shall be turned away into Sheol, all the nations that forget God.

18. For the needy shall not always be forgotten; the expectation of the poor shall not perish forever.

19. Arise, O Jehovah; let not man prevail. Let the nations be judged before Your face.

20. Put them in fear, O Jehovah; let the nations know that they are but men. Selah.

## Psalms 10

1. Why do You stand afar off, O Jehovah? Will You hide in times of distress?

2. The wicked in his pride persecutes the lowly; let them be caught in the plots that they have devised.

3. For the wicked boasts of his heartÂ’s desire, and blesses those who plunder, whom Jehovah has spurned.

4. Through the pride of his countenance the wicked do not seek after God; God is not in all his schemes.

5. His ways are always twisted; Your judgments are high, out of his sight. As for all his enemies, he snorts at them.

6. He has said in his heart, I shall not be moved; from generation to generation I shall not be in adversity!

7. His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression; under his tongue are trouble and wickedness.

8. He sits in the lurking places of the villages; in the secret places he murders the innocent; his eyes are hidden against the unfortunate ones.

9. He lies in wait secretly, like a lion in his den. He lies in wait to catch the poor; he catches the poor when he draws him into his net.

10. He lies low and crouches, and the poor unfortunate ones have fallen by his might.

11. He has said in his heart, the Mighty God has forgotten; He hides His face; He will never see it!

12. Arise, O Jehovah! O Mighty God, lift up Your hand! Forget not the lowly poor.

13. Why have the wicked spurned God? He has said in his heart, You will not investigate.

14. But You have seen it, for You pay attention to trouble and provocation; to repay it with Your hand. The poor commits himself to You; You are the Helper of the fatherless.

15. Break the arm of the wicked and the evil one; investigate his wickedness, until You find no more.

16. Jehovah is King forever and ever; the nations have perished out of His land.

17. Jehovah, You have heard the desire of the lowly; You will prepare their heart, You will cause Your ear to hear,

18. to vindicate the fatherless and the oppressed, so that the man of the earth may terrify no more.

## Psalms 11

__To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.__

1. In Jehovah I put my trust; how can you say to my soul, Flee like a bird to the mountains?

2. For lo, the wicked bend their bow; they make ready their arrow on the string, so that they may secretly shoot at the upright in heart.

3. If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?

4. Jehovah is in His holy temple; JehovahÂ’s throne is in Heaven; His eyes behold, His eyelids examine the sons of men.

5. Jehovah tries the righteous; but His soul hates the wicked and the one who loves violence.

6. Upon the wicked He will rain snares, fire and brimstone; and a horrible tempest shall be the portion of their cup.

7. For the righteous Jehovah loves righteousness; His face beholds the upright.

## Psalms 12

__To the Chief Musician. Sheminith. A Psalm of David.__

1. Help, Jehovah, for the godly man ceases; for the faithful have vanished from among the sons of men.

2. They speak vanity each one with his neighbor; with flattering lips and a double heart they speak.

3. Jehovah shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaks proud things,

4. that has said, We shall be strong with our tongue; our lips are our own; who is lord over us?

5. For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, I will now arise, says Jehovah; I will set him in the safety for which he pants.

6. The Words of Jehovah are pure Words, like silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.

7. You shall keep them, O Jehovah, You shall preserve them from this generation forever.

8. The wicked walk on every side, when vileness is exalted among the sons of men.

## Psalms 13

__To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.__

1. How long will You forget me, O Jehovah? Forever? How long will You hide Your face from me?

2. How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my inner being daily? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?

3. Consider and answer me, O Jehovah my God; enlighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;

4. lest my enemy say, I have prevailed against him, and those who oppress me rejoice when I am shaken.

5. But I have trusted in Your mercy; my heart shall rejoice in Your salvation.

6. I will sing to Jehovah, because He has dealt bountifully with me.

## Psalms 14

__To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.__

1. The fool has said in his heart, There is no God! They are corrupt; they have done abominable works, there is no one who does good.

2. Jehovah looked down from Heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any who understood and sought God.

3. They have all turned aside, together they have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, no, not one.

4. Have all the workers of iniquity not known, eating up My people as they eat bread? They have not called upon Jehovah.

5. There they were in great fear; for God is in the generation of the righteous.

6. You shame the counsel of the lowly, for Jehovah is his refuge.

7. Oh that the salvation of Israel was out of Zion! When Jehovah brings back the captivity of His people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

## Psalms 15

__A Psalm of David.__

1. O Jehovah, who may abide in Your tent? Who may dwell on Your holy hill?

2. He who walks uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart;

3. he who does not backbite with his tongue, nor does evil to his neighbor, nor takes up a reproach against his friend;

4. in whose eyes the reprobate is despised, but he honors those who fear Jehovah; he has sworn to his hurt, and does not change it;

5. he has not put out his money at interest, nor has he taken a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved.

## Psalms 16

__Michtam of David.__

1. Watch over me, O Mighty God, for in You I put my trust.

2. Oh my soul, you have said to Jehovah, You are my Lord; I have no goodness apart from You.

3. As for the saints who are on the earth, they are the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight.

4. Their sorrows shall be multiplied who hasten after another god. I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood; and I will not take up their names on my lips.

5. Jehovah is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup; You shall uphold my lot.

6. The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places; yea, I have a beautiful inheritance.

7. I will bless Jehovah, who has given me counsel; my heart also instructs me at night.

8. I have set Jehovah always before Me; because He is at My right hand, I shall not be moved.

9. Therefore My heart is glad, and My glory rejoices; My flesh also will rest in hope;

10. for You will not leave My soul in Sheol; nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.

11. You will make known to Me the way of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy. At Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.

## Psalms 17

__A Prayer of David.__

1. Hear a just cause, O Jehovah; give attention to my cry, listen to my prayer; for it is not from deceitful lips.

2. Let my sentence come forth from Your presence; let Your eyes behold with equity.

3. You have examined my heart; You have visited me in the night; You have tried me, and found nothing; I have purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.

4. Concerning the works of men, by the Words of Your lips, I have kept from the paths of the destroyer.

5. My steps have been upheld in Your paths, so that my footsteps have not slipped.

6. I have called upon You, for You hear me, O Mighty God; extend Your ear to me, and hear my speech.

7. Set apart Your wonderful lovingkindness, O You who by Your right hand saves those who trust in You, from those who rise up against me.

8. Keep me as the pupil of the eye; hide me under the shadow of Your wings,

9. from the face of the wicked who have devastated me; from the enemies of my soul who surround me.

10. They are enclosed in their own fat; with their mouths they speak proudly.

11. They have encompassed us in our steps, they keep watch with their eyes, lying down on the ground,

12. like a lion that longs to tear, and like a young lion lurking in secret places.

13. Arise, O Jehovah, forestall him; bow him down; deliver my soul from the wicked with Your sword,

14. from men by Your hand, O Jehovah, from men of the world whose portion is in this life, and whose belly You fill with Your hidden treasure. They are satisfied with children, and leave an abundance to their infants.

15. As for me, I will behold Your face in righteousness; when I awake, I shall be satisfied with the image of You.

## Psalms 18

__To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David, the servant of Jehovah, who spoke unto Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. And he said,__

1. I love You, O Jehovah, my strength.

2. Jehovah is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer; my Mighty God, my rock wall, in whom I will trust; He is my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.

3. I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised; so shall I be delivered from my enemies.

4. The cords of death have surrounded me, and the floods of the wicked made me afraid.

5. The cords of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of death have confronted me.

6. In my distress I called upon Jehovah, and cried out to my God; He heard my voice from His temple, and my cry came before Him, into His ears.

7. Then the earth shook and trembled; and the foundations of the hills quaked and were shaken, because He was angry.

8. Smoke went up out of His nostrils, and fire devoured out of His mouth; coals were kindled by it.

9. He also bowed the heavens and came down, and darkness was under His feet.

10. And He rode upon a cherub, and soared; yea, He flew swiftly upon the wings of the wind.

11. He made darkness His secret place; His pavilion around Him was dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.

12. From the brightness before Him, His dark clouds passed over with hailstones and coals of fire.

13. Jehovah also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave forth His voice, hailstones and coals of fire.

14. Yea, He sent out His arrows and scattered them; and He shot out lightnings and confounded them.

15. Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were uncovered at Your rebuke, O Jehovah, at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.

16. He sent from above, He took me, He drew me out of many waters.

17. He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from those who hated me; for they were too strong for me.

18. They confronted me in the day of my calamity; but Jehovah was my support.

19. He brought me forth also into a broad place; He delivered me because He delighted in me.

20. Jehovah rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands He has given back to me.

21. For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, and have not wickedly departed from my God.

22. For all His judgments were before me, and I did not put away His Statutes from me.

23. I was also perfect before Him, and I kept myself from my iniquity.

24. Therefore Jehovah has given back to me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in His eyes.

25. With the merciful You will show Yourself merciful; with a perfect man You will show Yourself perfect;

26. with the pure You will show Yourself pure; and with the crooked You will show Yourself twisted.

27. For You will save the lowly people, but will bring down lofty looks.

28. For You will light my lamp; Jehovah my God will cause my darkness to shine.

29. For by You I run against a troop; and by my God I leap over a wall.

30. As for the Mighty God, His way is perfect; the Word of Jehovah is tested; He is a shield to all those who trust in Him.

31. For who is God besides Jehovah? Or, who is a Rock except our God?

32. It is the Mighty God who clasps me with strength and makes my way perfect.

33. He makes my feet like the feet of deer, and sets me on my high places.

34. He teaches my hands to war, so that a bow of bronze is stretched by my arms.

35. You have also given me the shield of Your salvation; and Your right hand has held me up, and Your meekness has made me great.

36. You enlarged the place for my steps under me, so that my feet have not slipped.

37. I have pursued my enemies and overtaken them; nor did I turn back until they were destroyed.

38. I have shattered them, and they cannot rise again; they have fallen under my feet.

39. For You have clasped me with strength for the battle; You bowed down under me those who rose up against me.

40. You have also given me the necks of my enemies; so that I annihilated those who hated me.

41. They cried out for help, but there was no one to deliver; even to Jehovah, but He did not answer them.

42. Then I beat them fine as the dust before the wind; I cast them out like the dirt in the streets.

43. You have delivered me from the strivings of the people; You have made me the head of the nations; a people whom I have not known shall serve me.

44. As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me; the children of foreigners shall cower before me.

45. The children of foreigners shall fall down and come trembling out of their holes.

46. Jehovah lives! Blessed be my rock! Let the God of my salvation be exalted!

47. It is the Mighty God who avenges me, and puts the people to flight.

48. He delivers me from my enemies; yea, You lift me up above those who rise up against me; You have delivered me from the violent man.

49. Therefore I will give thanks to You, O Jehovah, among the nations, and make music unto Your name,

50. who gives great deliverance to His king, and deals mercy to His anointed, to David and to his seed forevermore.

## Psalms 19

__To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.__

1. The heavens declare the glory of the Mighty God; and the firmament proclaims His handiwork.

2. Day unto day pours forth speech, and night unto night reveals knowledge.

3. There is no speech nor words where their voice is not heard.

4. Their line has gone out through all the earth and their words to the ends of the world. In them He has set a tent for the sun,

5. which comes forth like a bridegroom out from his chamber; he exults as a strong man to run a race,

6. going forth from the end of the heavens, and its circuit to the ends of it. And there is nothing hidden from its heat.

7. The Law of Jehovah is perfect, converting the soul; the Testimony of Jehovah is sure, making wise the simple.

8. The Statutes of Jehovah are upright, rejoicing the heart; the Commandments of Jehovah are pure, illuminating the eyes.

9. The fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of Jehovah are true and altogether just,

10. more to be desired than gold, even than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

11. And Your servant is warned by them; in keeping them there is great reward.

12. Who can understand his errors? Acquit me of that which is hidden;

13. restrain Your servant from arrogance; do not let them rule over me. Then I shall be perfect, and I shall be innocent of great transgression.

14. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in Your sight, O Jehovah, my Rock and my Redeemer.

## Psalms 20

__To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.__

1. May Jehovah answer you in the day of distress, and the name of the God of Jacob set you securely on high,

2. sending you help from the sanctuary, and sustaining you out of Zion.

3. May He remember all your offerings, and accept your burnt offering. Selah.

4. May He grant you according to your inner heart, and fulfill all your counsel.

5. We will rejoice in your salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up banners; may Jehovah fulfill all your petitions.

6. Now I know that Jehovah saves His anointed; He will answer him from His holy Heaven with the saving strength of His right hand.

7. Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; but we will remember the name of Jehovah our God.

8. They have bowed down and fallen; but we have risen and stand upright.

9. Save, O Jehovah! Let the King answer us when we call.

## Psalms 21

__To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.__

1. The king shall rejoice in Your strength, O Jehovah; and in Your salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!

2. You have given him his heartÂ’s desire, and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.

3. For You go before him with the blessings of goodness; You set a crown of pure gold upon his head.

4. He asked life from You; You give to him length of days forever and ever.

5. His glory is great in Your salvation; honor and majesty You have placed upon him.

6. For You have made him most blessed forever; You have made him rejoice with gladness in Your presence.

7. For the king trusts in Jehovah, and through the mercy of the Most High he shall not be moved.

8. Your hand shall find out all Your enemies; Your right hand shall find out those who hate You.

9. You shall make them as a fiery oven in the time of Your presence; Jehovah will swallow them up in His wrath, and the fire shall devour them.

10. Their fruit shall You destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the sons of men.

11. For they intended evil against You; they devised a plot which they were not able to accomplish.

12. For You will make them turn their back; You will make ready Your arrows on Your strings against their faces.

13. Be exalted, O Jehovah, in Your own strength! We will sing, and make music unto Your power.

## Psalms 22

__To the chief Musician. Aijeleth Shahar. A Psalm of David.__

1. My Mighty God, My Mighty God, why have You forsaken Me, and are far from My deliverance, and from the words of My groaning?

2. O My God, I cry in the daytime, but You do not answer; and in the nighttime, and am not silent.

3. But You are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel.

4. Our fathers trusted in You; they trusted, and You delivered them.

5. They cried to You, and were delivered; they trusted in You, and were not ashamed.

6. But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised by the people.

7. All who see Me mock Me; they shoot out the lip; they shake the head, saying,

8. He trusted on Jehovah; let Him deliver Him; let Him rescue Him, since He delights in Him!

9. For You are He who took Me out of the womb, causing Me to trust while on My motherÂ’s breasts.

10. I was cast upon You from the womb; You are My Mighty God from My motherÂ’s belly.

11. Be not far from Me, for trouble is near; for there is no one to help.

12. Many bulls have encircled Me; strong bulls of Bashan have surrounded Me.

13. They have gaped at Me with their mouths, like a tearing and roaring lion.

14. I am poured out like water, and all My bones are separated; My heart is like wax, it has melted within Me.

15. My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and My tongue clings to My jaws; and You have brought Me into the dust of death.

16. For dogs have surrounded Me; the congregation of the wicked have enclosed Me. They have pierced My hands and My feet.

17. I can count all My bones. They look and stare at Me.

18. They divide My garments among them and cast lots for My clothing.

19. But You, O Jehovah, be not far from Me; O My Strength, make haste to help Me!

20. Deliver My soul from the sword, My only one from the hand of the dog.

21. Deliver Me from the lionÂ’s mouth; from the horns of the oryx. You have answered Me.

22. I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the assembly I will praise You.

23. You who fear Jehovah, praise Him! All you seed of Jacob, glorify Him; and fear Him all you seed of Israel!

24. For He has not despised nor detested the affliction of the afflicted; nor has He hidden His face from him; but when he cried out to Him, He heard.

25. My praise shall be of You in the great assembly; I will make good My vows before those who fear Him.

26. The lowly shall eat and be satisfied; those who seek Jehovah shall praise Him; your heart shall live forever.

27. All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to Jehovah; and all the families of the nations shall bow down before You.

28. For the kingdom is JehovahÂ’s; and He rules over the nations.

29. All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and bow down; all those who go down to the dust shall bow before Him, for no one can keep alive his own soul.

30. A seed shall serve Him; it shall be recounted of Jehovah to the coming generation.

31. They shall come, and shall declare His righteousness to a people that shall yet be born, that He has done this.

9. Do not take away my soul with sinners, nor my life with men of blood,

10. in whose hands is an evil plot, and their right hand is full of bribes.

3. Though an army should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise against me, in this I have confidence.

4. One thing I have desired from Jehovah, that I will seek after: That I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of Jehovah, and to inquire in His temple.

5. For in the time of evil He shall hide me in His den, in the secrecy of His tent He shall hide me; He shall lift me up upon a rock.

6. And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me; and I will offer sacrifices of joy in His tent. I will sing; yea, I will make music unto Jehovah.

8. When You say, Seek My face, my heart has said unto You, Your face, O Jehovah, I will seek.

3. Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace to their neighbors, yet evil is in their hearts.

4. Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their practices; give them according to the work of their hands; give back to them what they deserve.

2. O Jehovah my God, I cried out to You, and You have healed me.

3. O Jehovah, You have brought up my soul from Sheol; You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the Pit.

4. Make music unto Jehovah, O you saints of His, and give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness.

5. For His anger is but for a moment; in His favor is life. Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.

6. And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.

7. O Jehovah, by Your favor You have made my mountain to stand strong; You hid Your face, and I was troubled.

8. I cried out to You, O Jehovah; and unto Jehovah I made supplication.

9. What profit is there in my blood, in going down to the pit? Will the dust praise You? Will it declare Your truth?

10. Hear, O Jehovah, and have mercy upon me; Jehovah, be my helper!

11. You have turned my mourning into dancing for me; You have loosened my sackcloth, and clothed me with gladness,

12. so that my glory may make music unto You, and not be silent. O Jehovah my God, I will give thanks unto You forever.

## Psalms 31

__To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.__

1. In You, O Jehovah, I put my trust; let me never be ashamed; deliver me in Your righteousness.

3. For You are my rock and my fortress; therefore for Your great name lead me and guide me.

4. Bring me out of the net that they have hid for me, for You are my strength.

5. Into Your hand I commit my spirit; You have redeemed me, O Jehovah, the Mighty God of Truth.

7. I will be glad and rejoice in Your mercy; for You have looked upon my affliction; You have known the distress of my soul,

8. and have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; You have set my feet in a broad place.

9. Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah, for I am in trouble; my eye has wasted away with grief; even my soul and my belly.

10. For my life has been spent with grief, and my years with sighing; my strength fails because of my iniquity, and my bones have wasted away.

11. I was a reproach among all my enemies, but especially among my neighbors, and an object of dread to my friends; those who saw me outside have fled from me.

12. I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind; I am like a broken vessel.

13. For I have heard the slander of many; fear is on every side; while they take counsel together against me, they have plotted to take away my life.

14. But I trusted in You, O Jehovah; I have said, You are my God.

15. My times are in Your hand; deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from those who persecute me.

16. Make Your face shine upon Your servant; in Your mercy deliver me.

17. Let me not be ashamed, O Jehovah; for I have called upon You. Let the wicked be ashamed; let them be silent in Sheol.

18. Let the lying lips be put to silence; the lips which speak with arrogance, haughtiness and contempt against the just.

19. How great is Your goodness, which You have treasured up for those who fear You, which You have done for those who trust in You before the sons of men!

20. You shall hide them in the secret place of Your presence from the snares of man; You shall hide them in a shelter away from the strife of tongues.

21. Blessed is Jehovah, for He has shown me His marvelous kindness in a besieged city.

22. For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before Your eyes; but indeed You heard the voice of my supplications, when I cried out to You.

23. O love Jehovah, all you His saints; for Jehovah preserves the faithful, and abundantly recompenses the proud doer.

24. Be strong, and He will strengthen your heart, all you who hope in Jehovah.

4. For by day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; my sap was turned into the drought of summer. Selah.

7. He gathers the waters of the sea like a heap, and designates the depths in storehouses.

8. Let all the earth fear Jehovah; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.

9. For He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.

11. The counsel of Jehovah stands forever, the thoughts of His heart from generation to generation.

12. Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah; the people He has chosen for His possession.

13. Jehovah looks down from Heaven; He watches all the sons of mankind.

14. From His dwelling place He gazes upon all the inhabitants of the earth.

15. He fashions their hearts together; He understands all their works.

16. The king is not delivered by the multitude of an army; a mighty man is not rescued by much strength.

18. Behold, the eye of Jehovah is upon those who fear Him, on those who hope in His mercy;

19. to deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.

20. Our soul waits for Jehovah; He is our help and our shield.

21. For our heart shall rejoice in Him, because we have trusted in His holy name.

22. Let Your mercy, O Jehovah, be upon us, according as we have hoped in You.

8. O taste and see that Jehovah is good; blessed is the man who trusts in Him.

9. O fear Jehovah, you His holy ones; for there is nothing lacking to those who fear Him.

2. Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for my help.

3. Also draw out the spear and close up the way against those who pursue me; say to my soul, I am your salvation.

4. Let those who seek after my soul be put to shame and dishonored; let those who devise evil against me be turned back and abashed.

5. Let them be as chaff before the wind, and let the Angel of Jehovah drive them away.

6. Let their way be dark and slippery, and let the Angel of Jehovah pursue them.

7. For without cause they have hidden their net for me in a pit; without cause they have dug for my soul.

9. And my soul shall be joyful in Jehovah; it shall rejoice in His salvation.

10. All my bones shall say, Jehovah, who is like You, who delivers the lowly from him who is too strong for him; yea, the poor and the needy from him who plunders him?

11. Violent witnesses rose up; they asked of me things which I have not known.

12. They rewarded me evil for good, to the bereavement of my soul.

13. But when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth; I humbled my soul with fastings; and my prayer returned into my own bosom.

14. As a friend, as to my brother, I walked about; as one who mourns for a mother, I was bowed down in gloom, mourning.

15. But at my stumbling they gathered themselves together and rejoiced; and before I knew it the attackers gathered themselves against me; they tore at me and were not still;

16. with the hypocrites, mockers, for a cake, they gnashed at me with their teeth.

17. O Jehovah, how long will You look on? Rescue my soul from their ravages, my only one from the lions.

18. I will give You thanks in the great assembly; I will praise You among many people.

19. Let not those who are my deceitful enemies rejoice over me, nor let those who hate me without cause wink with the eye.

20. For they do not speak peace; but they devise deceitful things against the quiet ones of the earth.

21. They also open wide their mouths against me and have said, Aha, aha! Our eyes have seen it.

22. You have seen this, O Jehovah; do not keep silent; O Jehovah, do not be far from me.

23. Stir up Yourself and awake to my justice, to my case, my God and my Lord.

24. Give judgment for me, O Jehovah my God, according to Your righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.

25. Let them not say in their hearts, Aha! Our Soul! Let them not say, We have swallowed him up.

26. Let them be ashamed and abashed together, those who rejoice over my adversity. Let them be clothed with shame and reproach who magnify themselves against me.

27. Let those who delight in my justification shout and rejoice; and let them say continually, Let Jehovah be magnified, who delights in the welfare of His servant.

28. And my tongue shall speak of Your righteousness and of Your praise all day long.

## Psalms 36

__To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David, the servant of Jehovah.__

1. The transgression of the wicked declares within my heart: There is no fear of God before his eyes.

2. For he flatters himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity and hate is found.

3. The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit; he has left off acting wisely and doing good.

4. He devises wickedness on his bed; he sets himself in a way that is not good; he does not despise evil.

5. Your mercy, O Jehovah, is in the heavens; Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.

6. Your righteousness is like the great mountains; Your judgments are a great deep; O Jehovah, You deliver man and beast.

7. How precious is Your lovingkindness, O God! And the sons of men take refuge under the shadow of Your wings.

8. They shall be satisfied with the fatness of Your house; and You shall make them drink of the river of Your pleasures.

9. For with You is the Fountain of Life; in Your light we shall see light.

10. O continue Your lovingkindness to those who know You, and Your righteousness to the upright in heart.

11. Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked cause me to wander.

12. There the doers of wickedness have fallen; they have been cast down, and are not able to rise.

4. Delight yourself also in Jehovah, and He shall give you the desires of your heart.

5. Roll your ways upon Jehovah; trust also in Him, and He will bring it to pass.

6. And He will bring forth your righteousness like the light, and your justice like the noonday.

7. Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for Him; do not fret over him who prospers in his way, because of him who works out wicked devices.

8. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; do not fret; it only leads to evil.

9. For evildoers shall be cut off; but those who wait upon Jehovah, they shall inherit the earth.

10. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall be no more; indeed, you shall diligently consider his place, and it shall be no more.

11. But the lowly shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.

12. The wicked plots against the just, and gnashes at him with his teeth.

13. Jehovah laughs at him, for He sees that his day is coming.

14. The wicked have drawn out the sword and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, to slaughter those who walk uprightly.

15. Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.

17. For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but Jehovah upholds the righteous.

18. Jehovah knows the days of the upright, and their inheritance shall be forever.

19. They shall not be ashamed in the evil time, and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.

20. But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of Jehovah shall be as prized lambs; they are consumed; like smoke they vanish.

21. The wicked borrows and does not repay, but the righteous shows mercy and gives.

22. For those blessed by Him shall inherit the earth, and those cursed by Him shall be cut off.

23. The steps of a good man are ordered by Jehovah, and he delights in His way.

24. Though he fall, he shall not be cast down, for Jehovah upholds his hand.

25. I have been young, and now am old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.

26. All day long he is gracious and lends, and his seed is blessed.

27. Depart from evil and do good, and live forevermore.

28. For Jehovah loves justice and does not forsake His Godly ones; they are preserved forever; but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.

29. The righteous shall inherit the earth, and dwell in it forever.

30. The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom, and his tongue talks of justice.

31. The Law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.

32. The wicked watches the righteous, and seeks to kill him.

33. Jehovah will not abandon him in his hand, nor allow him to be found guilty when he is judged.

34. Wait upon Jehovah and keep His way, and He will lift you up to inherit the earth; when the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.

35. I have seen the wicked, ruthless, and spreading himself like a luxuriant native tree.

36. Yet he passed away, and lo, he was no more; indeed, I sought for him, but he could not be found.

37. Observe the perfect and consider the upright one; for the latter time of that man is peace.

38. But the transgressors shall be destroyed together; the end of the wicked shall be cut off.

39. But the salvation of the righteous is from Jehovah; He is their strength in the time of distress.

40. And Jehovah will help them and deliver them; He will deliver them from the wicked and save them, because they have trusted in Him.

## Psalms 38

__A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.__

1. O Jehovah, do not rebuke me in Your wrath, neither chasten me in Your fury.

2. For Your arrows pierce me, and Your hand presses down upon me.

3. There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your anger, nor peace within myself because of my sin.

4. For my iniquities have gone over my head; like a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.

5. My wounds have stunk and festered, because of my foolishness.

6. I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all day long.

7. For my loins are filled with inflammation, and there is no soundness in my flesh.

8. I am feeble and severely broken; I have roared because of the groanings of my heart.

9. Lord, all my desire is before You; and my sighing is not hidden from You.

10. My heart pants; my strength fails me; as for the light of my eyes, it also is gone from me.

11. My lovers and my friends stand at a distance from my plague; and my relatives stand afar off.

12. And those who seek my life lay snares for me; and those who seek my hurt speak of destruction, and devise treachery all day long.

13. But like one who is deaf, I do not hear; and I am like a mute one who opens not his mouth.

14. Thus I am like a man who hears not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.

15. For in You, O Jehovah, have I hoped; You will hear, O Lord my God.

16. For I said, Hear me, lest they rejoice over me; lest, when my foot slips, they magnify themselves against me.

17. For I am ready to fall, and my pain is continually before me.

18. For I will declare my iniquity; I am afraid because of my sin.

19. But my enemies are active; they are strong; and those who hate me wrongfully have multiplied.

20. And those who render evil for good oppose me, because I follow what is good.

21. Forsake me not, O Jehovah; O my God, be not far from me!

22. Make haste to help me, O Lord, my Salvation!

## Psalms 39

__To the Chief Musician. Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.__

1. I said, I will take heed to my ways so that I do not sin with my tongue; I will restrain my mouth with a muzzle while the wicked are before me.

2. I was mute with silence; I kept still, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred up.

3. My heart was hot within me; while I was musing, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue:

4. O Jehovah, make me to know my end, and what is the measure of my days, that I may know how frail I am.

5. Behold, You have made my days as a handbreadth, and my age is as nothing before You. Surely every man, even though standing tall, is total vanity. Selah.

6. Surely every man walks about like a shadow! Surely they are stirred up in vain. He heaps up the produce, and does not know who shall gather it.

7. And now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in You.

8. Deliver me from all my transgressions; make me not the reproach of the foolish.

9. I was mute, I did not open my mouth; because You have done it.

10. Remove Your stroke away from me; I am destroyed by the blow of Your hand.

11. You correct a man for iniquity with rebukes, and you make his desires vanish away like a moth. Surely every man is vanity. Selah.

12. Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, and give ear to my cry. Do not be silent at my tears; for I am a stranger with You, a sojourner, as all my fathers were.

13. Look away from me, that I may regain strength before I go away and be no more.

## Psalms 40

__To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.__

1. I waited patiently for Jehovah, and He inclined unto me, and heard my cry.

2. He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and secured my steps.

3. And He has put a new song in my mouth, praise to our God; many shall see it and fear, and shall trust in Jehovah.

4. Blessed is the man who makes Jehovah his trust and has not turned to the proud, nor to such as turn aside to lies.

5. O Jehovah my God, many are the wonderful works which You have done, and Your thoughts which are toward us; they cannot be recounted to You if I were to declare and speak of them, for they are more than can be numbered.

6. Sacrifice and offering You did not desire; my ears You have opened. Burnt offering and sin offering You have not asked.

7. Then I said, Lo, I come (in the volume of the Book it is written of Me):

8. I delight to do Your will, O My God, and Your Law is within My heart.

9. I have preached righteousness in the great assembly; lo, I have not restrained My lips, O Jehovah, You know.

10. I have not hidden Your righteousness within my heart; I have declared Your faithfulness and Your salvation; I have not hidden Your lovingkindness and Your truth from the great assembly.

11. Do not withhold Your tender mercies from me, O Jehovah; let Your lovingkindness and Your truth continually keep watch over me.

12. For evils without number have encompassed me; my iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of my head; therefore my heart fails me.

13. Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me; O Jehovah, make haste to help me!

14. Let them be ashamed and abashed together, those who seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to dishonor, those who wish me evil.

15. Let them be desolate as a consequence of their shame, those who say to me, Aha, aha!

16. Let all those who seek You rejoice and be glad in You, and the ones who love your salvation always say, Let Jehovah be magnified.

17. But I am poor and needy; yet Jehovah will have regard for me. You are my help and my deliverer; O my God, do not delay.

## Psalms 41

__To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.__

1. Blessed is he who gives attention to the poor; Jehovah will deliver him in the time of evil.

2. Jehovah will watch over him and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed on the earth; and You will not deliver him to the soul of his enemies.

3. Jehovah will sustain him on the bed of illness; You will change his bed of sickness.

4. I said, Jehovah, be merciful unto me; heal my soul; for I have sinned against You.

5. My enemies speak evil of me, saying, When will he die, and his name perish?

6. And when he comes to see me, he speaks vanity; his heart gathers iniquity to itself; he goes out and speaks of it.

7. All those who hate me whisper against me; they plot evil against me.

8. They say, A wicked thing is poured out upon him, and now that he lies down, he shall rise up no more.

9. Even the man of peace in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.

10. But You, O Jehovah, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, so that I may repay them.

11. By this I know that You delight in me, because my enemy does not triumph over me.

12. As for me, You uphold me in my integrity, and set me before Your face forever.

13. Blessed is Jehovah the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! Amen and Amen.

## Psalms 42

__To the chief Musician. Maschil. For the sons of Korah.__

1. As the deer pants after the water brooks, so my soul pants after You, O God.

2. My soul thirsts for God, for the living Mighty God; when shall I come and appear before God?

3. My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all the day, Where is your God?

4. When I remember these things, I pour out my soul within me; for I had gone with the multitude; I went with them to the house of God with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping the feast.

5. Why are you cast down, O my soul, and murmur within me? Hope in God; for I shall praise Him for the deliverance coming from His presence.

6. O my God, my soul is cast down within me; therefore I will remember You from the land of Jordan, from the summits of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.

7. Deep calls to deep at the sound of Your waterfalls; all Your waves and Your billows have gone over me.

8. Jehovah will command His lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night His song shall be with me, my prayer to the Mighty God of my life.

9. I will say to God my Rock, Why have You forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

10. As with a shattering of my bones, my enemies have reproached me, while they say daily to me, Where is your God?

11. Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why do you murmur within me? Hope in God; for I still praise Him for the deliverance coming from the presence of my God.

## Psalms 43

1. Judge for me, O God, and plead my case against an ungodly nation. O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.

2. For You are the God of my strength; why do You cast me off? Why do I go mourning under the oppression of the enemy?

3. O send out Your light and Your truth! Let them lead me; let them bring me to Your holy hill, and to Your tabernacle.

4. Then I will go to the altar of God, the Mighty God, my exceeding joy; yea, on the harp I will give thanks to You, O God, my God.

5. Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why do you murmur within me? Hope in God; for I still praise Him for the deliverance coming from the presence of my God.

## Psalms 44

__To the chief Musician. For the sons of Korah. Maschil.__

1. We have heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us the work which You did in their days, in the days of old.

2. You drove out the nations with Your hand, and planted them; You brought evil upon peoples and cast them out.

3. For they did not take the land into possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them; but it was Your right hand, and Your arm, and the light of Your face, because You favored them.

4. You are my king, O God; command victories for Jacob.

5. Through You we will push our enemies; through Your name we will trample those who rise up against us.

6. For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword deliver me.

7. But You have delivered us from our enemies, and have put to shame those who hated us.

8. In God we have boasted all day long, and praise Your name forever. Selah.

9. But You have cast us off and put us to shame, and You do not go forth with our armies.

10. You make us turn back from the enemy; and those who hate us have plundered for themselves.

11. You have given us up like sheep for food, and have scattered us among the nations.

12. You sell Your people for nothing, and have not increased wealth by their price.

13. You make us a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to those who are round about us.

14. You make us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples.

15. My disgrace is daily before me, and the shame of my face has covered me,

16. because of the voice of him who reproaches and reviles; before the enemy and avenger.

17. All this has come upon us; yet we have not forgotten You, nor dealt falsely with Your Covenant.

18. Our heart is not turned back, nor have our steps turned aside from Your way,

19. though You have crushed us in the place of dragons and covered us with the shadow of death.

20. If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god,

21. shall not God search this out? For He knows the secrets of the heart.

22. Yet, for Your sake we are killed all day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.

23. Awake! Why do You sleep, O Lord? Arise! Do not cast us off forever.

24. Why do You hide Your face, and forget our affliction and distress?

25. For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly clings to the earth.

26. Arise for our help, and redeem us through Your mercy!

## Psalms 45

__To the chief Musician. Shoshannim. For the sons of Korah. Maschil. A Song of the beloved.__

1. My heart has been stirred over a good matter; I speak of my works regarding the King; my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.

2. You are the fairest of the sons of men; grace is poured into Your lips; therefore God has blessed You forever.

3. Gird Your sword upon Your thigh, O mighty One, with Your glory and Your majesty.

4. And ride prosperously in Your majesty, because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and Your right hand shall teach You awesome things.

5. Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the KingÂ’s enemies; peoples fall under You.

6. Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; the scepter of Your kingdom is a scepter of uprightness.

7. You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your fellows.

8. All Your garments smell of myrrh, and aloes and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, by which they have made You glad.

9. KingsÂ’ daughters are among Your precious ones; on Your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir.

10. Listen, O daughter, consider and extend your ear; forget your own people also, and your fatherÂ’s house.

11. Thus the King shall greatly long for your beauty, for He is your Lord; bow down before Him.

12. And the daughter of Tyre shall come with a gift; even the rich among the peoples shall entreat your face.

13. The kingÂ’s daughter is all glorious within; her clothing is plaited with gold.

14. She shall be brought to the King in clothing of needlework; the virgins, her companions who follow, shall be brought to You.

15. They shall be brought with gladness and rejoicing; they shall enter into the KingÂ’s palace.

16. In the place of your fathers shall be your sons, whom you will make princes in all the earth.

17. I will make Your name to be remembered from generation to generation; therefore the people shall praise You forever and ever.

## Psalms 46

__To the chief Musician. A song for the sons of Korah. Alamoth.__

1. God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.

2. Therefore we will not fear when the earth changes, when mountains are slipping into the midst of the seas.

3. Let its waters roar and foam; let the mountains shake with the swelling of it. Selah.

4. There is a river whose streams cause rejoicing in the city of God, the consecrated place of the tabernacle of the Most High.

5. God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved; God shall help her at the break of day.

6. The nations raged, the kingdoms were shaken; He uttered His voice, the earth melted.

7. Jehovah of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.

8. Come, behold the works of Jehovah, who has made desolations on the earth;

9. who makes wars to cease to the ends of the earth; He breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two; He burns the chariots in the fire.

10. Be still, and know that I am God! I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth!

11. Jehovah of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.

## Psalms 47

__To the Chief Musician. A Psalm for the sons of Korah.__

1. Clap your hands, all you peoples! Shout unto God with the voice of triumph!

2. For Jehovah Most High is awesome, a great King over all the earth.

3. He shall put to flight the peoples under us, and nations under our feet.

4. He will choose our inheritance for us, the majesty of Jacob whom He has loved. Selah.

5. God has gone up with a shout, Jehovah with the sound of a shofar.

6. Sing praises unto God, sing praises! Sing praises unto our King, sing praises!

7. For God is King of all the earth; sing praises with understanding.

8. God reigns over the nations, God sits upon the throne of His holiness.

9. The nobles of the peoples are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham; for the shields of the earth belong to God; He is greatly exalted.

## Psalms 48

__A Song and Psalm for the Sons of Korah.__

1. Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of His holiness.

2. Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is Mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the Great King.

3. God is made known in her palaces for a refuge.

4. For, lo, the kings were assembled; they passed by together.

5. They saw it, so they marveled; they were troubled, and hurried away.

6. Fear took hold of them there, and writhing, like a woman giving birth.

7. You break the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.

8. As we have heard, so we have seen in the city of Jehovah of Hosts, in the city of our God. God will establish it forever. Selah.

9. We have thought of Your lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of Your temple.

10. According to Your name, O God, so is Your praise to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is full of righteousness.

11. Let Mount Zion rejoice! Let the daughters of Judah exult because of Your justice!

12. Walk around Zion, and go all around it; count the towers of it;

13. set your heart on its bulwarks, pass by its fortress; so that you may recount it to the following generation.

14. For this God is our God forever and ever; He will be our guide even unto death.

## Psalms 49

__To the Chief Musician. A Psalm for the sons of Korah.__

1. Hear this, all you peoples; give ear, all you inhabitants of the world;

2. both children of mankind, and sons of men, rich and poor together.

3. My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.

4. I will extend my ear to a parable; I will open my dark saying upon the harp.

5. Why should I fear in the days of evil, when the depravity of my supplanters surrounds me?

6. Those who trust in their wealth and boast in the abundance of their riches:

7. None of them can at all redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him

8. (for the redemption of their soul is precious, and it comes to an end forever),

9. that he might yet live forever and never see the pit.

10. For he sees wise men die; likewise the fool and the brutish ones perish, and leave their wealth to others.

11. Their inner thought is that their houses will last forever, and their dwelling places from generation to generation; they call their lands after their own names.

12. Nevertheless man, though precious, does not remain; he is like the animals that perish.

13. This way of theirs is their folly; yet those who follow delight in their sayings. Selah.

14. Like sheep they are appointed to the grave; death shall shepherd them, and the upright shall have the rule over them in the morning; their form is consumed; Sheol is their home.

15. But God will redeem my soul from the hand of Sheol; for He will carry me away. Selah.

16. Be not afraid when one becomes rich, when the glory of his house increases;

17. for when he dies he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not descend after him.

18. For in his life he blessed his own soul (indeed, they praise you when you do well for yourself).

19. But he shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.

20. A man with honor, but lacking understanding, is like the animals that perish.

## Psalms 50

__A Psalm of Asaph.__

1. The Mighty God Jehovah has spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun to its going down.

2. Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shone forth.

3. Our God comes, and He is not silent; a fire shall devour before Him, and it shall be very stormy all around Him.

4. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that He may judge His people.

5. Gather My saints to Me, and those who make a covenant with Me by sacrifice.

6. Let the heavens declare His righteousness, for God Himself is Judge. Selah.

7. Hear, My people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will testify against you; I am God, your God.

8. I will not reprove you for your sacrifices, or your burnt offerings, which are continually before Me.

9. I will take no bull out of your house, nor goats out of your folds;

10. for every beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills.

11. I know all the birds of the mountains; and the wild beasts of the field are Mine.

12. If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world is Mine, and the fullness of it.

13. Will I eat the flesh of the mighty, or drink the blood of goats?

14. Offer to God thanksgiving, and make good your vows to the Most High,

15. and call on Me in the day of trouble; and I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me.

16. But to the wicked God says, What is it you do, to declare My Statutes, and to take up My Covenant in your mouth;

17. seeing as how you hate correction, and cast off My Words behind you?

18. When you saw a thief, then you were pleased to be with him, and have been a partaker with adulterers.

19. You give your mouth to evil, and your tongue frames deceit.

20. You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own motherÂ’s son.

21. These things you have done, and I have kept silent; you thought that I was like yourself; but I will rebuke you, and set in order before your eyes.

22. Now consider this, you who forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be no one to deliver.

23. Whoever offers praise glorifies Me; and to him who orders his way, I will show the salvation of God.

## Psalms 51

__To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.__

1. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Your lovingkindness; according to the multitude of Your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions.

2. Wash me completely from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.

3. For I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is continually before me.

4. Against You, You only, have I sinned, and done evil in Your sight; that You might be found just when You speak, and pure when You judge.

5. Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.

6. Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts; and in the hidden part You shall make me to know wisdom.

7. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

8. Make me to hear joy and gladness, that the bones which You have broken may rejoice.

9. Hide Your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.

10. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.

11. Cast me not away from Your presence, and take not Your Holy Spirit from me.

12. Restore unto me the joy of Your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.

13. Then I will teach transgressors Your ways, and sinners shall be converted to You.

14. Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, O God of my salvation, and my tongue shall shout aloud of Your righteousness.

15. O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth shall show forth Your praise.

16. For You do not desire sacrifice, or else I would give it; You do not delight in burnt offering.

17. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.

18. Do good in Your good pleasure to Zion; build the walls of Jerusalem.

19. Then shall You be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering; then they shall offer bulls on Your altar.

## Psalms 52

__To the Chief Musician. Maschil. A Psalm of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said to him, David has come to the house of Ahimelech.__

1. Why do you boast yourself in evil, O mighty man? The Mighty God is good daily.

2. Your tongue devises destruction, like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.

3. You love evil more than good, and lying more than to speak righteousness. Selah.

4. You love all devouring words, O deceitful tongue.

5. The Mighty God will likewise destroy you forever; He will take you away, and pluck you out of your tent, and has rooted you out of the land of the living. Selah.

6. The righteous also shall see and fear, and shall laugh at him, saying,

7. Behold, the man who did not make God his strength, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and was strong in his wickedness.

8. But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever.

9. I will give thanks to You forever, because You have done it; and in the presence of Your saints I will wait upon Your name, for it is good.

## Psalms 53

__To the chief Musician. Mahalath. Maschil. A Psalm of David.__

1. The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity; there is no one who does good.

2. God looked down from Heaven upon the children of mankind to see if any was circumspect, seeking God.

3. Every one of them has turned back; they have all together become corrupt; not one is doing good, no, not even one.

4. Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? They eat up my people as they eat bread; they have not called upon God.

5. There they fear with dread, where there was no dread, for God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you; you have put them to shame because God has rejected them.

6. Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When God brings back the captivity of His people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

## Psalms 54

__To the Chief Musician. Neginoth. Maschil. A Psalm of David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Does not David hide himself among us?__

1. Deliver me, O God, by Your name, and contend for me by Your strength.

2. Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.

3. For strangers have risen up against me, and terrible men seek after my soul; they have not set God before them. Selah.

4. Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is with those who uphold my soul.

5. He will repay evil to my enemies; cut them off in Your truth.

6. I will freely sacrifice unto You; I will praise Your name, O Jehovah, for it is good.

7. For He has delivered me out of all trouble; and my eye has seen its desire upon my enemies.

## Psalms 55

__To the chief Musician. Neginoth. Maschil. A Psalm of David.__

1. Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not Yourself from my supplication.

2. Give attention to me, and hear me; I am restless in my meditation, and murmur;

3. because of the voice of the enemy, from the oppression of the wicked; for they drop down trouble upon me, and in wrath they hate me.

4. My heart writhes within me; and the terrors of death have fallen upon me.

5. Fear and trembling have come upon me, and horror overwhelms me.

6. And I said, Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest.

7. Lo, I would wander far off; I would abide in the wilderness. Selah.

8. I would hasten my escape from the rushing wind and tempest.

9. Swallow up, O Lord, and divide their tongues; for I have seen violence and strife in the city.

10. Day and night they go around upon its walls; wickedness and trouble are also in its midst.

11. Lust is in its midst; oppression and guile do not depart from its streets.

12. For it is not an enemy who reproaches me, then I could bear it. It is not one who hates me who magnified himself against me, or I would hide myself from him;

13. but it is you, a man my equal, my friend and acquaintance.

14. We took sweet counsel together, and walked to the house of God in the throng.

15. Let death seize them, and let them go down alive into Sheol; for evil is among them and in their dwellings.

16. As for me, I will call upon God, and Jehovah will deliver me.

17. Evening and morning and at noon I meditate and am in a stir; and He will hear my voice.

18. He has delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me; for there were many against me.

19. The Mighty God will hear and testify to them, even He who abides from of old. Selah. Because they do not change, therefore they do not fear God.

20. He has put forth his hands against those who were at peace with him; he has broken his covenant.

21. His flattery has been with forked tongue, and war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.

22. Cast your burden upon Jehovah, and He will sustain you; He will never allow the righteous to totter.

23. But You, O God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction; bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in You.

## Psalms 56

__To the chief Musician. Jonathelemrechokim. Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath.__

1. Be merciful to me, O God, for man would swallow me up. Fighting daily, he oppresses me.

2. My enemies have panted after me daily; for they are many who proudly fight against me.

3. When I am afraid I trust in You.

4. In God (I praise His Word), in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do to me.

5. All day long they twist my words; all their thoughts are against me for evil.

6. They stir up strife; they hide themselves; they watch my steps as they lie in wait for my soul.

7. Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, O God!

8. You have kept an account of my wanderings; O put my tears into Your bottle; are they not in Your Book.

9. When I cry out, then my enemies shall be turned back. This I know, for God is with me.

10. In God (I praise His Word); in Jehovah (I praise His Word);

11. In God I have put my trust; I will not be afraid of what man can do to me.

12. Your vows are upon me, O God; I will give thanks unto You,

13. for You have delivered my soul from death. Have You not kept my feet from falling, so that I may walk before God in the light of the living?

## Psalms 57

__To the chief Musician. Altaschith. Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave.__

1. Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me; for my soul trusts in You. Yea, in the shadow of Your wings I will make my refuge, until these calamities pass by.

2. I will cry out unto God Most High, unto the Mighty God who does all things for me.

3. He will send from Heaven, and deliver me from the reproaches of him who would swallow me up. Selah. God will send forth His mercy and His truth.

4. My soul is among lions; I lie among the sons of men who are on fire, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

5. Be exalted above the heavens, O God; let Your glory be above all the earth.

6. They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down; they have dug a pit before me, they have fallen into it. Selah.

7. My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and make music.

8. Awake, my honor! Awake, lute and harp! I will awaken the dawn.

9. I will give thanks unto You, O Lord, among the peoples; I will make music unto You among the nations.

10. For Your mercy is great to the heavens, and Your truth unto the clouds.

11. Be exalted above the heavens, O God; let Your glory be above all the earth.

## Psalms 58

__To the chief Musician. Altaschith. Michtam of David.__

1. Do you indeed speak justice, O silent ones? Do you judge with equity, O sons of men?

2. Indeed, in heart you work injustice; you weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth.

3. The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray from the belly, speaking lies.

4. Their poison is like the poison of a serpent, like the deaf cobra that stops its ear,

5. which will not heed the charmerÂ’s voice, who charms so skillfully.

6. O God, break their teeth in their mouth; break out the fangs of the young lions, O Jehovah.

7. Let them flow away like waters that move along. When he bends his bow to shoot arrows, let them be as though they were cut off.

8. Let them be as a snail that melts away; as a stillborn child of a woman, that has not seen the sun.

9. Before your pots can feel the thorns, whether green or glowing, He shall sweep it away.

10. The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.

11. And man shall say, Truly, there is a reward for the righteous; truly, there is a God who judges in the earth.

## Psalms 59

__To the chief Musician. Altaschith. Michtam of David; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.__

1. Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; defend me from those who rise up against me.

2. Rescue me from the workers of wickedness, and deliver me from men of blood.

3. For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul; the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression nor for my sin, O Jehovah.

4. They run and prepare themselves though there is no fault in me. Awake to meet me, and pay attention!

5. You therefore, O Jehovah the God of Hosts, the God of Israel, awake and punish all the nations; do not be merciful to any wicked traitors. Selah.

6. They return at evening; they growl like a dog, and go all around the city.

7. Behold, they belch with their mouth; swords are in their lips; for they say, Who hears?

8. But You, O Jehovah, shall laugh at them; You will have all the nations in derision.

9. I wait upon You, O my Strength; for God is my refuge.

10. The God of my mercy shall go before me; God shall let me see my desire upon my enemies.

11. Do not kill them, lest my people forget; scatter them by Your power and bring them down, O Lord our shield.

12. Let them be taken in their pride for the sin of their mouth and the word of their lips, along with the cursing and the lying which they speak.

13. Consume them in wrath, consume them, so that they may not be; and let them know that God rules in Jacob to the ends of the earth. Selah.

14. And at evening when they return, let them growl like a dog, and go all around the city.

15. Let them wander up and down for food, and pass the night unsatisfied.

16. But I will sing of Your power; yes, I will sing aloud of Your mercy in the morning; for You have been my stronghold and refuge in the day of my distress.

17. To You, O my Strength, I will make music; for God is my stronghold and the God of my mercy.

## Psalms 60

__To the Chief Musician. Shushaneduth. Michtam of David, to teach; when he struggled with Syrian Naharaim and with Syrian Maachah, when Joab returned and struck twelve thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt.__

1. O God, You have cast us off, You have broken us, You were angry; bring us back.

2. You have made the earth tremble; You split it open. Heal its breaks, for it is shaking.

3. You have shown Your people hard things; You have made us drink the wine of staggering.

4. You have given a banner to those who fear You, to flee to before truth. Selah.

5. That Your beloved may be rescued, deliver with Your right hand and respond to me.

6. God has spoken in His holiness: I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem and measure out the valley of Succoth.

7. Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the refuge of My head; Judah is My lawgiver;

8. Moab is My washpot; over Edom will I cast off My shoe; Philistia, shout in triumph.

9. Who will bring me into the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom?

10. Have not You, O God, cast us off? And will not You, O God, go out with our armies?

11. Give us help from distress; for the help of man is vain.

12. Through God we shall do mightily; for it is He who will trample our enemies.

## Psalms 61

__To the chief Musician. Neginah. A Psalm of David.__

1. Hear my cry, O God; give attention to my prayer.

2. From the ends of the earth I cry out to You when my heart is faint; lead me to the Rock that is higher than I.

3. For You have been a shelter for me, a strong tower before the enemy.

4. I will dwell in Your tent forever; I will trust in the shelter of Your wings. Selah.

5. For You, O God, have heard my vows; You have given an inheritance to those who fear Your name.

6. You will add days to the days of the king; his years unto generations and generations.

7. He shall abide before God forever; appoint mercy and truth to preserve him.

8. So I will make music unto Your name forever, so that I may daily make good my vows.

## Psalms 62

__To the chief Musician. Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.__

1. Only before God is my soul silent; from Him comes my salvation.

2. He only is my rock and my salvation; He is my stronghold; I shall not be greatly moved.

3. How long will you assail a man? You shall be slain, all of you, like a bowing wall and a tottering fence.

4. Surely they have plotted to cast him down from his high position; they delight in lies; they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.

5. My soul, be still only before God; for my expectation is from Him.

6. He only is my rock and my salvation; He is my stronghold; I shall not be shaken.

7. In God is my salvation and my glory; the rock of my strength; my refuge is in God.

8. Trust in Him at all times, you people; pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for us. Selah.

9. Surely the sons of men are a vapor; men are a lie; if they were to climb up into the scales, they are altogether lighter than vapor.

10. Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery; if riches increase, do not set your heart upon them.

11. God has spoken once, twice I have heard this: That power belongs to God.

12. Also to You, O Jehovah, belongs mercy; for You give to every man according to his work.

## Psalms 63

__A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.__

1. O God, You are my Mighty God. I will seek You earnestly; my soul thirsts for You; my flesh longs for You, as in a dry and weary land, where there is no water.

2. I have seen You in the sanctuary, to look upon Your power and Your glory.

3. Because Your lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise You.

4. So I will bless You while I live; I will lift up my hands in Your name.

5. My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise You with joyful lips,

6. when I remember You upon my bed and meditate on You in the night watches.

7. Because You have been my help, therefore in the shadow of Your wings will I rejoice.

8. My soul has clung to You; Your right hand upholds me.

9. But those who seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.

10. They shall fall by the sword; they shall be a portion for foxes.

11. But the king shall rejoice in God; everyone who swears by Him shall glory; but the mouth of those who speak lies shall be stopped.

## Psalms 64

__To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.__

1. Hear my voice, O God, in my meditation; preserve my life from fear of the enemy.

2. Hide me from the counsel of the wicked, from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity,

3. who sharpen their tongue like a sword. They have bent their bows to shoot their arrows; even bitter words,

4. so that they may shoot at the perfect one from a hiding place; suddenly they shoot at him and do not fear.

5. They encourage themselves in an evil plan; they talk of laying snares secretly; they say, Who shall see them?

6. They devise injustice; they have finished searching out a plot. Yea, the inward part of man and the heart are unfathomable.

7. But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly they shall be wounded.

8. So they shall stumble over their own tongues; everyone who sees them shall flee away.

9. And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall prudently comprehend His works.

10. The righteous shall be glad in Jehovah, and shall trust in Him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.

## Psalms 65

__To the Chief Musician. A Psalm and Song of David.__

1. Silence is praise to You, O God, in Zion; and unto You is a vow performed.

2. To You who hears prayer, all flesh comes.

3. Perverse speech has prevailed against me; as for our transgressions, You shall atone for them.

4. Blessed is the one whom You choose, and cause to draw near You. He shall dwell in Your courts; we shall be satisfied with the goodness of Your house, of Your holy temple.

5. By awesome deeds in righteousness You will answer us, O God of our salvation; You who are the hope of all the ends of the earth and the sea, of those far away.

6. The mountains are established by Your strength, girded with might,

7. who stills the noise of the sea, the roar of their waves, and the tumult of the peoples.

8. And those who dwell in the remotest regions are afraid of Your signs; You make the goings forth of the morning and evening rejoice.

9. You visit the earth and water it; You greatly enrich it; the river of God is full of water; You provide their grain, for in this way You have prepared it.

10. You water its furrows with water; You deepen its ridges; You make it soft with showers; You bless the sprouting of it.

11. You crown the year with Your goodness, and Your trenches drip with fertility.

12. They trickle on the pastures of the wilderness; and the little hills are girded with rejoicing.

13. The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with grain; they shout for joy and sing.

## Psalms 66

__To the Chief Musician. A Psalm. A Song.__

1. Shout for joy unto God, all the earth!

2. Make music to the honor of His name; make His praise glorious.

3. Say unto God, How awesome are Your works! Through the greatness of Your power Your enemies cower before You.

4. All the earth shall bow down before You and sing unto You, and make music unto Your name. Selah.

5. Come and see the works of God; He is awesome in His deeds toward the sons of men.

6. He has turned the sea into dry land; they went through the river on foot; there we rejoiced in Him.

7. He rules by His power forever; His eyes keep watch over the nations; let not the rebels lift themselves up and exalt. Selah.

8. O bless our God, you peoples, and make the voice of His praise to be heard;

9. who gives our souls life, and does not allow our feet to slip.

10. For You have tried us, O God; You have refined us, as silver is refined.

11. You have brought us into the net; You have laid affliction upon our loins.

12. You have allowed men to ride over our heads; we have gone through fire and through water, but You have brought us out into plenty.

13. I will go into Your house with burnt offerings; I will make good to You my vows,

14. which my lips have uttered and my mouth has spoken when I was in distress.

15. I will offer to You burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bulls with goats. Selah.

16. Come and hear, all you who fear God, and I will declare what He has done for my soul.

17. I cried out unto Him with my mouth, and He was lifted up in praise with my tongue.

18. If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear.

19. Surely God has heard; He has given attention to the voice of my prayer.

20. Blessed is God, who has not turned away my prayer, nor His mercy from me!

## Psalms 67

__To the Chief Musician. Neginoth. A Psalm. A Song.__

1. God be merciful unto us, and bless us, and cause His face to shine upon us. Selah.

4. O let the nations be glad and sing for joy! For You shall judge the peoples righteously and govern the nations on earth. Selah.

5. Let the peoples give thanks to You, O God; let all the peoples give thanks to You.

6. Then the earth shall yield its increase; and God, our own God, shall bless us.

7. God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear Him.

## Psalms 68

__To the chief Musician. A Psalm or Song of David.__

1. Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered; let those also who hate Him flee before Him.

2. As smoke is driven away, so drive them away; as wax melts before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.

3. But the righteous are glad; they rejoice before God. Yes, let them exceedingly rejoice.

4. Sing unto God, make music unto His name; exalt Him who rides in the wilderness by His name YAH, and rejoice before Him.

5. In His holy dwelling God is a father to the fatherless, and a judge for the widows.

6. God causes those who are alone to live in households; He delivers those who are bound into prosperity; but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.

7. O God, when You went out before Your people, when You marched through the wilderness; Selah:

8. The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God; Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.

9. You, O God, sent a plentiful rain, by which You established Your inheritance when it was weary.

10. Your community has dwelt in it; You, O God, have provided from Your goodness for the poor.

11. The Lord gave the Word; great was the host of those who proclaimed it.

12. Kings of armies fled, they fled away; and she who stayed at home divided the spoils.

13. When you lie down among the sheepfolds, you shall be like the wings of a dove covered with silver, and its pinions with yellow gold.

14. When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it snowed in Salmon.

15. Mount Bashan is GodÂ’s mountain; Mount Bashan is a mountain of peaks.

16. Why do you gaze in envy, O mountain peaks, at the mountain where God desires to dwell? Yes, Jehovah will abide in it forever.

17. The chariots of God are a vast innumerable number, thousands of thousands; the Lord is among them as at Sinai, in the Holy Place.

18. You have gone up on high; You have led captivity captive; You have received gifts for men, yes, even for the rebellious; that YAH God might dwell among them.

19. Blessed is the Lord who day by day bears our burdens, the Mighty God of our salvation! Selah.

20. Our Mighty God is the God of salvation; and unto Jehovah the Lord belong the escapes from death.

21. But God shall wound the head of His enemies, and the hairy head of him who walks on in his guilt.

22. The Lord said, I will bring back from Bashan; I will bring back My people from the depths of the sea;

23. so that your foot may shatter your enemies in blood, and the tongue of your dogs may lap it.

24. They have seen Your goings, O God; the goings of my Mighty God, my King, in the sanctuary.

25. The singers went before, then those playing instruments followed; among them were the maidens playing the timbrels.

26. Bless God in the congregations, the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.

27. There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the leaders of Judah and their multitude, the leaders of Zebulun, and the leaders of Naphtali.

28. Your God has commanded your strength; O God, be strong in that which You have done for us.

29. Because of Your temple at Jerusalem, kings shall bring presents unto You.

30. Rebuke the beasts of the reeds, the community of the bullheaded with the calves of the peoples, trampling with pieces of silver. Scatter the people who delight in war.

31. Ambassadors shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall hurry with gifts in her hands unto God.

32. Sing unto God, you kingdoms of the earth; O make music unto the Lord. Selah.

33. To Him who rides on the Heavens of heavens from antiquity; lo, He sends out His voice, a mighty voice.

34. Ascribe strength unto God over Israel; His majesty and His strength in the clouds.

35. O God, You are awesome out of Your sanctuary; the Mighty God of Israel is He who gives strength and power to the people. Blessed is God.

## Psalms 69

__To the chief Musician. Shoshannim. A Psalm of David.__

1. Deliver me, O God; for the waters have come in upon my soul!

2. I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing; I have come into deep waters, where the floods have overflowed me.

3. I am weary from my crying; my throat is dried; my eyes fail while I wait for my God.

4. They who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; my deceitful enemies who would destroy me are mighty. I am made to bring back what I did not take away.

5. O God, You know my folly, and my guilt is not hidden from You.

6. Do not let those who wait upon You, O Lord Jehovah of Hosts, be ashamed because of me; let not those who seek You be put to shame because of me, O God of Israel,

7. because I have borne reproach for Your sake, shame has covered my face.

8. I have become a stranger to My brothers, and a foreigner to My motherÂ’s children.

9. For the zeal of Your house has eaten Me up; and the reproaches of those who reproached You have fallen upon Me.

10. When I wept in my soul with fasting, it became my reproach.

11. I also made sackcloth my clothing, and I became a byword to them.

12. Those who sit in the gate speak against me, and I am the taunting song of the drunkards.

13. But as for me, my prayer is to You, O Jehovah, in a favorable time; O God, in the multitude of Your mercies hear me, in the truth of Your salvation.

14. Rescue me out of the mire, and let me not sink; let me be rescued from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters.

15. Do not let the flood of waters overflow me, nor let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut its mouth upon me.

16. Hear me, O Jehovah, for Your lovingkindness is good; turn to me according to the multitude of Your tender mercies.

17. And hide not Your face from Your servant; for I am in trouble; hear me speedily.

18. Draw near to My soul, and redeem it; deliver Me because of My enemies.

19. You have known My reproach, and My shame, and My dishonor; My enemies are all before You.

20. Reproach has broken My heart, and I am full of heaviness. I looked for someone to show pity, but there was no one; and for comforters, but I found none.

21. They also gave Me gall for my food; and in My thirst they gave Me vinegar to drink.

22. Let their table become a snare before them; and to those at peace, a trap.

23. Let their eyes be darkened, so that they do not see; and make their loins shake continually.

24. Pour out Your indignation upon them, and let Your burning anger take hold of them.

25. Let their dwelling place be desolate; let no one dwell in their tents.

26. For they have persecuted the ones whom You have stricken, and they talk to the grief of those You pierced.

27. Add iniquity to their iniquity, and let them not come into Your righteousness.

28. Let them be blotted out of the Book of Life, and not be written with the righteous.

29. But I am lowly and in pain; let Your salvation, O God, set me up on high.

30. I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify Him with thanksgiving.

31. This also shall please Jehovah better than an ox or a bull that has horns and hooves.

32. The lowly shall see and be glad; and your heart shall live, you who seek God.

33. For Jehovah hears the needy, and does not despise His prisoners.

34. Let the heavens and earth praise Him, the seas, and everything that moves in them.

35. For God will deliver Zion, and will build the cities of Judah, that they may dwell there and possess it.

36. And the seed of His servants shall inherit it, and those who love His name shall dwell in it.

## Psalms 70

__To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.__

1. Make haste, O God, to rescue me; make haste to help me, O Jehovah.

2. Let them be ashamed and abashed, those who seek after my soul; let them be turned backward and dishonored, those who desire my hurt.

3. Let them be turned back as a consequence of their shame, those who say, Aha, aha!

4. Let all those who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; and let those who love Your salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.

5. But I am lowly and needy; make haste to me, O God! You are my help and my deliverer; O Jehovah, do not delay!

## Psalms 71

1. In You, O Jehovah, I put my trust; let me never be put to shame.

2. Rescue me in Your righteousness, and cause me to escape; extend Your ear to me, and save me.

3. Be a rock of refuge for me, to which I may continually go; You have given command to save me, for You are my Rock and my Fortress.

4. Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

5. For You are my hope, O Lord Jehovah, my trust from my youth.

6. Upon You I have been supported from the womb; You are He who took me out of my motherÂ’s belly; my praise shall continually be of You.

7. I am like a wonder to many, but You are my strong refuge.

8. Let my mouth be filled with Your praise, with Your glory all the day.

9. Do not cast me off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength fails.

10. For my enemies speak against me; and those who lie in wait for my soul take counsel together,

11. saying, God has forsaken him; pursue and take him, for there is no one to rescue him.

12. O God, be not far from me; O my God, make haste to help me!

13. Let them be ashamed; let those who are enemies of my soul be consumed; let them be covered with reproach and dishonor, who seek my hurt.

14. But I will hope continually, and I have praised You again and again.

15. My mouth shall recount Your righteousness and Your salvation all the day; for I do not know their number.

16. I will go in the strength of the Lord Jehovah; I will keep in remembrance Your righteousness; Yours alone.

17. O God, You have taught me from my youth; and to this day I have declared Your marvelous works.

18. And now when I am old and grayheaded, O God, do not leave me, until I have declared Your strength to this generation, and Your power to everyone who is to come.

19. Your righteousness also, O God, is very high, You who have done great things. O God, who is like You,

20. who has shown me great and evil distresses. You will revive me again, and bring me up again from the depths of the earth.

21. You will increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.

22. I will also give thanks unto You with the lute, O my God, for Your faithfulness. To You I will make music with the harp, O Holy One of Israel.

23. My lips shall greatly rejoice when I make music unto You, and my soul, which You have redeemed.

24. My tongue also shall meditate on Your righteousness all day long; for those who seek evil upon me are abashed; they are brought to shame.

## Psalms 72

__A Psalm for Solomon.__

1. Give the king Your justice, O God, and Your righteousness to the kingÂ’s Son.

2. He will judge Your people in righteousness, and Your lowly with justice.

3. The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.

4. He shall execute justice for the lowly of the people; He shall save the children of the needy, and shall crush in pieces the oppressor.

5. They shall fear You as long as the sun and moon endure, from generation to generation.

6. He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass, like showers that water the earth.

7. In His days the righteous shall flourish, and abundance of peace, until the moon is no more.

8. He shall also have dominion from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.

9. Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before Him; and His enemies shall lick the dust.

10. The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents; the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

11. Yea, all kings shall fall down before Him; all nations shall serve Him.

12. For He shall deliver the needy when he cries, and the lowly who has no helper.

13. He shall have pity on the poor and needy and shall save the souls of the needy.

14. He shall redeem their soul from oppression and violence; and their blood shall be precious in His sight.

15. And He shall live, and to Him shall be given the gold of Sheba; and prayer shall continually be made for Him; He shall be blessed daily.

16. There shall be an abundance of grain in the earth on the top of the mountains; its fruit shall shake like Lebanon, and those of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.

17. His name is eternal; His name shall continue and increase before the sun; and men shall be blessed in Him; all nations shall call Him blessed.

18. Blessed is Jehovah God, the God of Israel, who alone does wondrous things.

19. And blessed is His glorious name forever; let all the earth be filled with His glory! Amen and Amen.

20. The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.

## Psalms 73

__A Psalm of Asaph.__

1. Truly God is good to Israel, to the pure of heart.

2. But as for me, my foot had almost stumbled; my steps had nearly slipped.

3. For I was jealous of the boastful, when I saw the peace of the wicked.

4. For there are no bonds in their death; but their belly is fat.

5. They are not in trouble like other men; neither are they plagued like other men.

6. Therefore pride is their necklace; violence covers them like a garment.

7. Their eyes bulge with fatness; they have more than the heart could imagine.

8. They scoff and speak of evil oppression; they speak arrogantly.

9. They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongues walk through the earth.

10. Therefore His people return here, and waters of a full cup are drained out to them.

11. And they say, How does the Mighty God know? and, Is there knowledge in the Most High?

12. Behold, these are the wicked, who are continually at ease; they increase in riches.

13. Surely I have made my heart pure in vain, and washed my hands in innocence.

14. For all day long I have been plagued, and chastened every morning.

15. If I had said, I will speak thus; behold, I would have deceived a generation of Your sons.

16. When I thought deeply in order to understand this, it was troublesome to me,

17. until I went into the sanctuary of the Mighty God; then I understood their end.

18. Surely You set them in slippery places; You cast them down to desolation.

19. How have they been brought to desolation, as in a moment! They are fully brought to an end with destruction,

20. like a dream when one awakes; so, O Lord, when You awake, You shall despise their image.

21. For my heart was grieved and I was pierced to the core.

22. I was so foolish and ignorant; I was like a beast before You.

23. Nevertheless I am continually with You; You have held me by my right hand.

24. You will lead me with Your counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.

25. Whom have I in Heaven besides You? And there is no one I desire on earth.

26. My flesh and my heart waste away; but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion forever.

27. For lo, those who are far from You shall perish; You have destroyed all those who go whoring away from You.

28. But it is good for me to draw near to God; I have put my trust in the Lord Jehovah, to declare all Your works.

## Psalms 74

__Maschil of Asaph.__

1. O God, have You cast us off forever? Will Your anger smoke against the sheep of Your pasture?

2. Remember Your congregation, which You have purchased of old, the scepter of Your inheritance which You have redeemed; this mount Zion in which You have dwelt.

3. Lift up Your feet to the perpetual desolations, even all the evil the enemy has done in the sanctuary.

4. Your enemies roar in the midst of Your meeting place; they set up their banners for signs.

5. They are known for bringing their axes against the thick trees.

6. And now all its engravings they strike down with axes and hammers.

7. They have set fire to Your sanctuary; they have defiled to the ground the dwelling place of Your name.

8. They said in their hearts, Together let us violently oppress them. They have burned up all the meeting places of the Mighty God in the land.

9. We do not see our signs; there is no prophet any more; neither is there among us any who knows how long.

10. O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? Will the enemy blaspheme Your name forever?

11. Why do You withdraw Your hand, even Your right hand? From your bosom, draw it out of Your bosom and exterminate them.

12. For God is my King of old, working deliverance in the midst of the earth.

13. You have divided the sea by Your strength; You have broken the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.

14. You have crushed the heads of leviathan, and given him to be food to the people living in the wilderness.

15. You have cleaved open the fountain and the flood; You have dried up mighty rivers.

16. The day is Yours, the night also is Yours; You have prepared the light and the sun.

17. You have established all the borders of the earth; You have made summer and winter.

18. Remember this, that the enemy has reproached, O Jehovah, and that the foolish people have blasphemed Your name.

19. O do not deliver the soul of Your turtle dove to the beasts; forget not the community of Your lowly forever.

20. Have regard to the covenant; for the dark places of the earth are full of the abode of violence.

21. O let not the oppressed return ashamed; let the lowly and needy praise Your name.

22. Arise, O God, plead Your own case; remember the daily reproaches of the fool.

23. Forget not the voice of Your enemies; the roar of those who rise up against You continually increases.

## Psalms 75

__To the chief Musician. Altaschith. A Psalm or Song of Asaph.__

1. Unto You, O God, we have given thanks, unto You we have given thanks; for Your wondrous works have declared that Your name is near.

2. When I choose the appointed time, I will judge with equity.

3. The earth and all its inhabitants are melting away; I have meted out its pillars. Selah.

4. I said to the boastful, Do not deal boastfully; and to the wicked, Do not lift up the horn;

5. do not lift up your horn on high; nor speak with a stiff neck.

6. For exaltation comes neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.

7. But God is the Judge; He puts down one and exalts another.

8. For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is fully mixed; and He pours out from it; but the dregs of it, all the wicked of the earth shall drain its dregs and drink.

9. But I will declare forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.

10. I will also cut off all the horns of the wicked; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.

## Psalms 76

__To the chief Musician. Neginoth. A Psalm or Song of Asaph.__

1. In Judah God is known; His name is great in Israel.

2. In Salem also is His covert, and His dwelling place in Zion.

3. There He broke the flaming arrows of the bow, the shield and sword, and the battle. Selah

4. You are more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.

5. The stouthearted were plundered; they have become drowsy and fallen asleep; and none of the mighty men have found their hands.

6. At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep.

7. You, Yourself, are to be feared; and who may stand in Your presence when once You are angry?

8. You caused judgment to be heard from Heaven; the earth feared and was still,

9. when God arose to justice, to deliver all the lowly of the earth. Selah

10. Surely the wrath of man shall praise You; with the remainder of wrath You shall gird Yourself.

11. Vow unto Jehovah your God, and make good; let all who are around Him bring presents to Him who is to be feared.

12. He shall cut off the spirit of princes; He is to be feared by the kings of the earth.

## Psalms 77

__To the chief Musician. Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.__

1. I cried out unto God with my voice; unto God with my voice; and He gave ear unto me.

2. In the day of my distress I sought the Lord; my hand was stretched out in the night without ceasing; my soul refused to be comforted.

3. I remembered God, and was troubled; I complained, and my spirit fainted. Selah

4. You have held my eyelids open; I am so disturbed that I cannot speak.

5. I have considered the days of old, the years of antiquity.

6. I call to remembrance my song in the night; I meditate within my heart, and my spirit makes diligent search.

7. Will the Lord cast off forever? And will He be pleased no more?

8. Has His mercy come to an end forever? Has His Word failed from generation to generation?

9. Has the Mighty God forgotten to be gracious? Has He in anger shut up His tender mercies? Selah

10. And I said, This is my weakness; the years of the right hand of the Most High.

11. I will remember the works of YAH; surely I will remember Your wonders of old.

12. I will also meditate on all Your works, and talk of Your deeds.

13. Your way, O God, is in holiness; who is so great a Mighty God as our God?

14. You are the Mighty God who does wonders; you have declared Your strength among the peoples.

15. You have with Your arm redeemed Your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah

16. The waters saw You, O God; the waters saw You, they were afraid; the depths also trembled.

17. The clouds poured out water; the skies sent out a sound; Your arrows also went here and there.

18. The voice of Your thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightnings lit up the world; the earth trembled and shook.

19. Your way was in the sea, Your path in the great waters, and Your footsteps have not been known.

20. You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

## Psalms 78

__Maschil of Asaph.__

1. Give ear, O my people, to my instruction; extend your ears to the words of my mouth.

2. I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old,

3. which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.

4. We will not hide them from their children, recounting to the following generation the praises of Jehovah, and His strength and His wonderful works that He has done.

5. For He established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a Law in Israel, which He commanded our fathers, that they should declare them to their children;

6. that the following generation might know them, the children who would be born, that they might arise and recount them to their children,

7. that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of the Mighty God, but keep His commandments;

8. and might not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that did not set its heart aright, and whose spirit has not been faithful to the Mighty God.

9. The sons of Ephraim, being armed to shoot with their bows, turned back in the day of battle.

10. They did not keep the Covenant of God; they refused to walk in His Law,

11. and forgot His works and His wonders that He had shown them.

12. He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

13. He divided the sea and caused them to pass through; and He made the waters stand up like a heap.

14. In the daytime also He led them with the cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.

15. He split the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink in abundance from the depths.

16. He also brought streams out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.

17. But they sinned even more against Him by rebelling against the Most High in the wilderness.

18. And they tested the Mighty God in their heart by asking for food for the lust of their soul.

19. Yes, they spoke against God: They said, Can the Mighty God set a table in the wilderness?

20. Behold, He struck the rock, so that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed. Can He give bread also? Can He provide flesh for His people?

21. Therefore Jehovah heard this and was furious; so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel,

22. because they did not believe in God, and did not trust in His salvation;

23. though He had commanded the clouds above, and opened the doors of the heavens,

24. had rained down manna upon them to eat, and given them of the grain of the heavens.

25. Men ate the bread of the mighty; He sent them food to the full.

26. He caused an east wind to blow in the heavens; and by His power He brought in the south wind.

27. He also rained flesh upon them like the dust, and winged birds like the sand of the seas;

28. and He let them fall into the midst of their camp, all around their dwellings.

29. So they ate and were abundantly satisfied, for He gave them their own desire.

30. They were not deprived of their lust; but while their food was still in their mouths,

31. the wrath of God came upon them, and killed the fattest of them, and struck down the choice men of Israel.

32. For all this they still sinned, and did not believe in His wondrous works.

33. Therefore He brought an end to their days in vanity, and their years in dismay.

34. When He killed them, then they sought after Him; and they returned and sought earnestly for the Mighty God.

35. Then they remembered that God was their rock, and the Most High God was the One who redeemed them.

36. Nevertheless they deceived Him with their mouths, and they lied to Him with their tongues;

37. for their heart was not steadfast with Him, nor were they faithful in His covenant.

38. But He, being compassionate, forgave their iniquity, and did not destroy them; yea, many a time He turned His anger away, and did not stir up all His wrath;

39. for He remembered that they were but flesh, a breath that passes away and does not come again.

40. How often they provoked Him in the wilderness, and grieved Him in the desert!

41. Yea, they turned back and tempted the Mighty God, and troubled the Holy One of Israel.

42. They did not remember His hand, the day when He ransomed them from the enemy,

43. when He brought to pass His signs in Egypt, and His wonders in the fields of Zoan;

44. turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink.

45. He sent swarms of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.

46. He also gave their crops to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.

47. He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost.

48. He also gave up their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to lightning.

49. He cast upon them His burning anger, wrath, indignation, and distress, by sending evil angels.

50. He made a path for His anger; He did not spare their soul from death, but gave their life over to the plague,

51. and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the first of their strength in the tents of Ham.

52. But He made His own people go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock;

53. and He led them on safely, so that they did not fear; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.

54. And He brought them to the border of His sanctuary, this mountain which His right hand had acquired.

55. He also drove out the nations before them, allotted them an inheritance by a surveyorÂ’s line, and made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.

56. Yet they tested and provoked the Most High God, and did not keep His Testimonies,

57. but turned back and acted unfaithfully like their fathers; they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.

58. For they provoked Him to anger with their high places, and moved Him to jealousy with their graven images.

59. When God heard this, He was angry, and greatly despised Israel,

60. so that He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which He had placed among men,

61. and delivered His strength into captivity, and His glory into the enemyÂ’s hand.

62. He also gave His people over to the sword, and was angry with His inheritance.

63. The fire consumed their young men, and their maidens were not given in marriage.

64. Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.

65. Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep, like a mighty man overcome with wine.

66. And He struck His enemies; He put them to a perpetual reproach.

67. Moreover He rejected the tent of Joseph, and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,

68. but chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which He loved.

69. And He built His sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which He has founded forever.

70. He also chose David His servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;

71. from following the ewes nursing their young He brought him, to shepherd Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance.

72. So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

## Psalms 79

__A Psalm of Asaph.__

1. O God, the nations have come into Your inheritance; Your holy temple they have defiled; they have laid Jerusalem in heaps.

2. The dead bodies of Your servants they have given as food for the birds of the heavens, the flesh of Your saints to the beasts of the earth.

3. Their blood they have shed like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them.

4. We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to those who are around us.

5. How long, Jehovah? Will You be angry forever? Will Your jealousy burn like fire?

6. Pour out Your wrath upon the nations that have not known You, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon Your name.

7. For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.

8. Oh, do not remember our former iniquities against us! Let Your tender mercies come speedily to meet us, for we have been brought very low.

9. Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Your name; and rescue us, and make atonement for our sins, for Your nameÂ’s sake!

10. Why should the nations say, Where is their God? Let it be known among the nations in our sight, the avenging of the blood of Your servants which has been shed.

11. Let the groaning of the prisoner come before You; according to the greatness of Your power preserve alive the children of death;

12. and return upon our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached You, O Lord.

13. So we, Your people and sheep of Your pasture, will continually give You thanks; we will show forth Your praise from generation to generation.

## Psalms 80

__To the chief Musician. Shoshannimeduth. A Psalm of Asaph.__

1. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, You who lead Joseph like a flock; You who dwell between the cherubim, shine forth!

2. Stir up Your strength before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh and come and save us!

3. Bring us back, O God, and cause Your face to shine, and we shall be saved!

4. O Jehovah the God of Hosts, how long will You be angry against the prayer of Your people?

5. You have fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink a third time.

6. You make us an object of contention to our neighbors, and our enemies laugh among themselves.

7. Bring us back, O God of Hosts; cause Your face to shine, and we shall be saved!

8. You have brought a vine out of Egypt; You have cast out the nations and planted it.

9. You have cleared away for it, and caused the roots to take root, and it filled the land.

10. The hills were covered with its shade, and its boughs were like mighty cedars.

11. It sent out its boughs to the Sea, and its branches to the River.

12. Why have You broken down its hedges, so that all who pass by the way pluck its fruit?

13. The boar out of the woods tears it up, and the wild beast of the field devours it.

14. Return, we beseech You, O God of Hosts; look down from Heaven and look upon and visit this vine,

15. and the vineyard which Your right hand has planted, and the son that You made strong for Yourself.

16. It is burned with fire, it is cut down; they perish at the rebuke of Your face.

17. Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand, upon the son of man whom You have made strong for Yourself.

18. Then we will not turn back from You; revive us, and we will call upon Your name.

19. Turn us back, O Jehovah the God of Hosts; cause Your face to shine, and we shall be saved!

## Psalms 81

__To the chief Musician. Gittith. A Psalm of Asaph.__

1. Sing aloud unto God our strength; make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob.

2. Raise a song; bring out the timbrel, the pleasant harp and lute.

3. Blow the shofar at the new moon, at the full moon, on our solemn feast day.

4. For this is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.

5. This He has ordained in Joseph as a testimony, when He went throughout the land of Egypt, where I heard a language I did not understand.

6. I removed his shoulder from the burden; his hands left the pots.

7. You called in distress, and I rescued you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah

8. Hear, O My people, and I will testify to you! O Israel, if you will listen to Me:

9. There shall be no strange god among you; nor shall you bow down to any foreign god.

10. I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt; open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.

11. But My people would not heed My voice, and Israel would have none of Me.

12. So I gave them over to their own stubborn heart, to walk in their own counsels.

13. Oh, that My people had listened to Me, that Israel had walked in My ways!

14. I would soon have subdued their enemies, and turned My hand against their adversaries.

15. The haters of Jehovah would have cowered before Him, and their time would have endured forever.

16. He would have fed them also with the finest of the wheat; and with honey out of the rock I would have satisfied you.

## Psalms 82

__A Psalm of Asaph.__

1. God stands in the congregation of the mighty; He judges among the gods.

2. How long will you judge unjustly, and show partiality to the wicked? Selah

3. Defend the poor and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and needy.

4. Deliver the poor and needy; rescue them out of the hand of the wicked.

5. They do not know, nor do they understand; they walk about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.

6. I have said, You gods, all of you are sons of the Most High.

7. But you shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.

8. Arise, O God, judge the earth; for You shall inherit all nations.

## Psalms 83

__A Song or Psalm of Asaph.__

1. Do not keep silent, O God! Do not hold Your peace, and do not be still, O Mighty God!

2. For lo, Your enemies roar; and those who hate You have lifted up their head.

3. They have taken crafty counsel against Your people, and conspired against Your treasure.

4. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation, that the name of Israel may be remembered no more.

5. For they have consulted together with one heart; they covenant an alliance against You:

6. The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab and the Hagrites;

7. Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;

8. Assyria also has joined with them; they have helped the sons of Lot. Selah

9. Deal with them as with Midian, as with Sisera, as with Jabin at the Brook Kishon,

10. who perished at En Dor, who became as dung upon the land.

11. Make their nobles like Oreb and like Zeeb, yea, all their anointed like Zebah and Zalmunna,

12. who have said, Let us take for ourselves the pastures of God for a possession.

13. O my God, make them like the whirling dust, like the chaff before the wind!

14. As the fire burns the forest, and as the flame sets the mountains on fire,

15. so pursue them with Your tempest, and terrify them with Your storm.

16. Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek Your name, O Jehovah.

17. Let them be ashamed and dismayed forever; yea, let them be abashed and perish,

18. that they may know that You, whose name alone is Jehovah, are the Most High over all the earth.

## Psalms 84

__To the chief Musician. Gittith. A Psalm for the sons of Korah.__

1. How lovely is Your dwelling place, O Jehovah of Hosts!

2. My soul longs, yea, is spent for the courts of Jehovah; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living Mighty God.

3. Even the sparrow has found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young; even Your altars, O Jehovah of Hosts, my King and my God.

4. Blessed are those who dwell in Your house; they will still praise You. Selah

5. Blessed is the man whose strength is in You, whose heart is upon Your highways.

6. As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a spring; the early rain also covers it with blessings.

7. They go from strength to strength, appearing before God in Zion.

8. O Jehovah the God of Hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah

9. Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of Your anointed.

10. For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness.

11. For Jehovah God is a sun and shield; Jehovah will give grace and glory; no good thing will He withhold from those who walk in integrity.

12. O Jehovah of Hosts, blessed is the man who trusts in You!

## Psalms 85

__To the chief Musician. A Psalm for the sons of Korah.__

1. Lord, You have been gracious to Your land; You have brought back the captivity of Jacob.

2. You have forgiven the iniquity of Your people; You have covered all their sin. Selah

3. You have withdrawn all Your wrath; You have drawn back from Your burning anger.

4. Restore us, O God of our salvation, and make a break in Your anger toward us.

5. Will You be angry with us forever? Will You draw out Your anger from generation to generation?

6. Will You not revive us again, that Your people may rejoice in You?

7. Show us Your mercy, Jehovah, and grant us Your salvation.

8. I will hear what Jehovah the Mighty God will speak, for He will speak peace to His people and to His saints; but let them not turn back to folly.

9. Surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him, that glory may dwell in our land.

10. Mercy and truth have met together; righteousness and peace have kissed.

11. Truth shall spring out of the earth, and righteousness shall look down from Heaven.

12. Yea, Jehovah will give good; and our land shall yield its increase.

13. Righteousness shall go before Him, and shall set us in the way of His steps.

## Psalms 86

__A Prayer of David.__

1. Extend Your ear, O Jehovah, hear me; for I am lowly and needy.

2. Preserve my soul, for I am holy; You my God, save Your servant who trusts in You!

3. Be merciful unto me, O Lord, for I cry out to You daily.

4. Make glad the soul of Your servant, for unto You, O Lord, I lift up my soul.

5. For You, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, and abounding in mercy unto all those who call upon You.

6. Give ear, O Jehovah, unto my prayer; and give attention to the voice of my supplications.

7. In the day of my distress I will call upon You, for You will answer me.

8. Among the gods there is none like You, O Lord; nor any like Your works.

9. All nations whom You have made shall come and bow down before You, O Lord, and shall glorify Your name;

10. for You are great, and do wondrous things; You alone are God.

11. Teach me Your way, O Jehovah; I will walk in Your truth; unite my heart to fear Your name.

12. I will praise You, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify Your name always.

13. For great is Your mercy toward me, and You have delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol.

14. O God, the proud have risen against me, and the company of violent men have sought after my soul, and have not set You before them.

15. But You, O Lord, are a Mighty God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering and abundant in mercy and truth.

16. O turn to me, and have mercy upon me! Give Your strength to Your servant, and deliver the son of Your handmaid.

17. Show me a sign for good, that those who hate me may see it and be ashamed, because You, Jehovah, have helped me and comforted me.

## Psalms 87

__A Psalm or Song for the sons of Korah.__

1. His foundation is in the holy mountains.

2. Jehovah loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.

3. Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God! Selah

4. I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to those who know me; behold, O Philistia and Tyre, with Ethiopia: this one was born there.

5. And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man have been born in her; and the Most High shall establish her.

6. Jehovah will take account, when He registers the peoples: This one was born there. Selah

7. Both the singers and the players on pipes say, All my springs are in you.

## Psalms 88

__A Song or Psalm for the sons of Korah, to the chief Musician. Mahalath Leannoth. Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite.__

1. O Jehovah the God of my salvation, I have cried out day and night before You.

2. Let my prayer come before You; extend Your ear to my cry.

3. For my soul is full of evil, and my life draws near to Sheol.

4. I am reckoned with those who go down to the pit; I am like a man with no strength,

5. free among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom You remember no more, and who have been cut off from Your hand.

6. You have laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the depths.

7. Your wrath has leaned upon me, and You have afflicted me with all Your waves. Selah

8. You have removed my acquaintances far from me; You have made me an abomination to them; I am shut up, and I cannot go out;

9. my eye has become faint because of affliction. Jehovah, I have called daily upon You; I have stretched out my hands unto You.

10. Will You work wonders for the dead? Shall the dead arise and give thanks to You? Selah

11. Shall Your lovingkindness be declared in the grave? Or Your faithfulness in Abaddon?

12. Shall Your wonders be known in the dark? And Your righteousness in the land of oblivion?

13. But unto You I have cried out, O Jehovah, and in the morning my prayer comes before You.

14. Jehovah, why do You cast off my soul? Why do You hide Your face from me?

15. I have been afflicted and ready to die from my youth; I have suffered Your terrors; I am perplexed.

16. Your fury has passed over me; Your terrors have cut me off.

17. They have encompassed me like water all day long; they have engulfed me altogether.

18. Lover and friend You have removed far from me, and my acquaintances into darkness.

## Psalms 89

__Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite.__

1. I will sing of the mercies of Jehovah forever; with my mouth will I make known Your faithfulness from generation to generation.

2. For I have said, Mercy shall be built up forever; Your faithfulness You shall establish in the heavens.

3. I have made a covenant with My elect, I have sworn unto David My servant:

4. Your seed I will establish forever, and build up your throne from generation to generation. Selah

5. And the heavens shall confess Your wonders, O Jehovah; Your faithfulness also in the assembly of the saints.

6. For who in the clouds can be compared to Jehovah? Who among the sons of the gods can be likened unto Jehovah?

7. The Mighty God is greatly to be feared in the council of the saints, and to be held in reverence by all those around Him.

8. O Jehovah the God of Hosts, who is mighty like You, O YAH? Your faithfulness is round about You.

9. You rule the raging of the sea; when its waves rise, You still them.

10. You have broken Rahab in pieces, as one who is slain; You have scattered Your enemies with Your mighty arm.

11. The heavens are Yours, the earth also is Yours; You have founded the world and all its fullness.

12. The north and the south, You have created them; Tabor and Hermon rejoice in Your name.

13. You have a mighty arm; strong is Your hand, and exalted is Your right hand.

14. Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; mercy and truth go before Your face.

15. Blessed are the people who know the shouts of joy! They walk, O Jehovah, in the light of Your countenance.

16. In Your name they rejoice all day long, and in Your righteousness they are exalted.

17. For You are the glory of their strength, and in Your favor our horn is exalted.

18. For Jehovah is our shield, and our King, the Holy One of Israel.

19. Then You spoke in a vision to Your holy one, and said: I have placed help upon a mighty one; I have exalted a chosen one out of the people.

20. I have found David, My servant; with My holy oil I have anointed him;

21. with whom My hand shall be established; My arm also shall strengthen him.

22. The enemy shall not exact usury upon him, nor the son of injustice afflict him.

23. I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague those who hate him.

24. But My faithfulness and My mercy shall be with him, and in My name his horn shall be exalted.

25. I will also set his hand over the sea, and his right hand over the rivers.

26. He shall call unto Me, You are my Father, my Mighty God, and the Rock of my salvation.

27. And I will make him My firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.

28. My mercy I will keep for him forever, and My covenant shall be established with him.

29. His seed also I have ordained eternally, and His throne as the days of Heaven.

30. If his sons forsake My Law and do not walk in My justice,

31. if they break My Statutes and do not keep My Commandments,

32. then I will punish their transgression with the rod, and their perversities with strokes.

33. Nevertheless in My lovingkindness I will not crush him, nor deal falsely in My faithfulness.

34. My covenant I will not break, nor alter what has gone forth out of My lips.

35. Once I have sworn by My holiness; I will not lie to David:

36. His seed is forever, and his throne as the sun before Me;

37. it shall be established forever like the moon, a faithful witness in the clouds. Selah

38. But You have cast off and rejected, You have passed over Your anointed.

39. You have spurned the covenant of Your servant; You have dishonored his crown on the ground.

40. You have broken down all his hedges; You have brought his strongholds to ruin.

41. All who pass by the way plunder him; he is a reproach to his neighbors.

42. You have exalted the right hand of his oppressors; You have made all his enemies rejoice.

43. You have also turned back the edge of his sword, and have not sustained him in the battle.

44. You have made his glory to cease, and hurled his throne down to the ground.

45. The days of his youth You have shortened; You have covered him with shame. Selah

46. How long, Jehovah? Will You hide Yourself forever? Will Your fury burn like fire?

47. Remember the time of life; why have you created the sons of men for vanity?

48. What strong man can live and not see death? Can he deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah

49. O Lord, where are Your former lovingkindnesses which You swore unto David in Your faithfulness?

50. Remember, O Lord, the reproaches of Your Servant, which I bear in My bosom, of all the many peoples,

51. with which Your enemies have reproached, O Jehovah, with which they have reproached the heel of Your Anointed.

52. Blessed is Jehovah forevermore! Amen and Amen.

## Psalms 90

__A Prayer of Moses the man of God.__

1. O Lord, You have been our dwelling place from generation to generation.

2. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are the Mighty God.

3. You return man to dust, and say, Return, O sons of men.

4. For a thousand years in Your sight are like yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.

5. You carry them away like a flood; they are like a sleep. In the morning they are like grass which grows up:

6. In the morning it blossoms and sprouts; in the evening it is cut down and dries up.

7. For we have been consumed by Your anger, and by Your wrath we have been terrified.

8. You have set our iniquities before You, our secrets in the light of Your countenance.

9. For all our days have turned away in Your wrath; we finish our years with a sigh.

10. The days of our years are seventy years; and if by reason of vigor they are eighty years, yet their boast is toil and wickedness; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.

11. Who knows the power of Your anger? For as is the fear of You, so is Your wrath.

12. So teach us to number our days, that we may bring about a heart of wisdom.

13. Return, O Jehovah! How long? And have compassion on Your servants.

14. O satisfy us early with Your mercy, that we may exult and be glad all our days!

15. Make us glad according to the days in which we have been afflicted, the years in which we have seen evil.

16. Let Your work appear unto Your servants, and Your glory unto their children.

17. And let the beauty of Jehovah our God be upon us, and establish the work of our hands upon us; yea, establish the work of our hands.

## Psalms 91

1. He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

2. I will say of Jehovah, He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in Him will I trust.

3. Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the destructive pestilence.

4. He shall cover you with His feathers, and under His wings you shall take refuge; His truth shall be your shield and buckler.

5. You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flies by day,

6. nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday.

7. A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; but it shall not come near you.

8. Only with your eyes shall you look, and see the retribution of the wicked.

9. Because you have made Jehovah, who is my refuge, even the Most High, your dwelling place,

10. no evil shall befall you, nor shall any plague come near your dwelling;

11. for He shall give His angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways.

12. In their hands they shall bear you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone.

13. You shall tread upon the lion and the viper, the young lion and the dragon you shall trample underfoot.

14. Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore I will deliver him; I will set him on high, because he has known My name.

15. He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him and honor him.

16. With long life I will satisfy him, and show him My salvation.

## Psalms 92

__A Psalm or Song for the sabbath day.__

1. It is good to give thanks to Jehovah, and to make music to Your name, O Most High;

2. to declare Your lovingkindness in the morning, and Your faithfulness every night,

3. on an instrument of ten strings, on the lute, and on the harp, with resounding music.

4. For You, Jehovah, have made me glad through Your work; I will triumph in the works of Your hands.

5. O Jehovah, how great are Your works! Your thoughts are very deep.

6. A brutish man does not know, nor does a fool understand this.

7. When the wicked spring up like grass, and when all the workers of iniquity blossom, it is that they may be destroyed forever.

8. But You, Jehovah, are on high forever.

9. For lo, Your enemies, O Jehovah, for lo, Your enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

10. But my horn You have exalted like an oryx; I have been anointed with fresh oil.

11. My eye also shall see my desire upon my enemies; my ears shall hear my desire upon the wicked who rise up against me.

12. The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree, he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.

13. Those who are planted in the house of Jehovah shall flourish in the courts of our God.

14. They shall still bear fruit in old age; they shall be fat and luxuriant;

15. to declare that Jehovah is upright; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.

## Psalms 93

1. Jehovah reigns, He is clothed with majesty; Jehovah is clothed, He has girded Himself with strength. The world also is established, so that it cannot be shaken.

2. Your throne is established from of old; You are from eternity.

3. The streams have lifted up, O Jehovah, the streams have lifted up their sound; the streams lift up their waves.

4. Jehovah on high is mightier than the sound of many waters, than the mighty breakers of the sea.

5. Your Testimonies are very sure; holiness befits Your house, O Jehovah, to the length of days.

## Psalms 94

1. O Jehovah, Mighty God, to whom vengeance belongs; O Mighty God, to whom vengeance belongs, shine forth!

2. Be exalted, O Judge of the earth; restore recompense to the proud.

3. Jehovah, how long will the wicked, how long will the wicked triumph?

4. They belch forth, and speak arrogant things; all the workers of iniquity boast in themselves.

5. They crush Your people, O Jehovah, and afflict Your heritage.

6. They slay the widow and the sojourner, and murder the fatherless.

7. Yet they say, YAH does not see, nor does the God of Jacob perceive it.

8. Understand, you stupid ones among the people; and you fools, when will you be wise?

9. He who planted the ear, shall He not hear? He who formed the eye, shall He not see?

10. He who chastens the nations, shall He not correct, He who teaches man knowledge?

11. Jehovah knows the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.

12. Blessed is the man whom You correct, O YAH, and teach out of Your Law,

13. that You may give him rest from the evil days, until the pit is dug for the wicked.

14. For Jehovah will not cast off His people, nor will He forsake His inheritance.

15. But justice shall return to righteousness, and all the upright in heart shall follow it.

16. Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?

17. Unless Jehovah had been my help, my soul would shortly have dwelt in silence.

18. If I had said, My foot slips, Your mercy, O Jehovah, holds me up.

19. In the multitude of my anxieties within me, Your comforts delight my soul.

20. Shall the throne of iniquity, which fashions trouble by decree, have fellowship with You?

21. They gather together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.

22. But Jehovah has been my defense, and my God the rock of my refuge.

23. He brings upon them their own iniquity, and will cut them off in their own evil; Jehovah our God shall cut them off.

## Psalms 95

1. Oh come, let us sing unto Jehovah! Let us shout joyfully unto the Rock of our salvation.

2. Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving; let us shout joyfully to Him with psalms.

3. For Jehovah is the great and Mighty God, and the great King above all gods.

4. In His hand are the deep places of the earth; the summits of the hills are also His.

5. The sea is His, for He made it; and His hands formed the dry land.

6. Oh come, let us prostrate ourselves and bow down; let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker.

7. For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand. Today, if you will hear His voice:

8. harden not your hearts, as in the strife, as in the day of testing in the wilderness,

9. when your fathers tried Me; they examined Me and saw My work.

10. For forty years I was grieved with that generation, and said, It is a people who go astray in their hearts, and they have not known My ways.

11. So I swore in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest.

## Psalms 96

1. Oh, sing unto Jehovah a new song! Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth.

2. Sing unto Jehovah, bless His name; proclaim the good news of His salvation from day to day.

3. Declare His glory among the nations, His wonders among all peoples.

4. For Jehovah is great and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.

5. For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but Jehovah made the heavens.

6. Honor and majesty are before Him; strength and beauty are in His sanctuary.

7. Ascribe unto Jehovah, O families of the peoples, ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength.

8. Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due His name; bring an offering, and come into His courts.

9. O bow down before Jehovah in the beauty of holiness! Tremble before Him, all the earth.

10. Say among the nations, Jehovah reigns; the world also is firmly established, it shall not be shaken; He shall judge the peoples with equity.

11. Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and all its fullness;

12. let the field be joyful, and all that is in it. Then all the trees of the forests shall rejoice before Jehovah.

13. For He is coming, for He is coming to judge the earth. He shall judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with His truth.

## Psalms 97

1. Jehovah reigns; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of the islands be glad!

2. Clouds and darkness are round about Him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne.

3. A fire goes before Him and burns up His enemies round about.

4. His lightnings light up the world; the earth sees and trembles.

5. The mountains melt like wax at the presence of Jehovah, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

6. The heavens declare His righteousness, and all the peoples see His glory.

7. Let all be put to shame who serve graven images, who boast of idols. Bow down before Him, all you gods.

8. Zion has heard and was glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of Your judgments, O Jehovah.

9. For You, Jehovah, are most high above all the earth; You are exalted far above all gods.

10. You who love Jehovah, hate evil! He preserves the souls of His saints; He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.

11. Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.

12. Rejoice in Jehovah, you righteous, and give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness.

## Psalms 98

1. O sing unto Jehovah a new song! For He has done marvelous things; His right hand and His holy arm have given Him the victory.

2. Jehovah has made known His salvation; His righteousness He has laid bare in the eyes of the nations.

3. He has remembered His mercy and His faithfulness to the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

4. Shout joyfully unto Jehovah, all the earth; break forth with praise, and make music.

5. Make music unto Jehovah with the harp, with the harp and the voice of melody,

6. with trumpets and the sound of a shofar; shout joyfully before Jehovah, the King.

7. Let the sea roar, and all its fullness, the world and those who dwell in it;

8. let the rivers clap their hands; let the hills be joyful together before Jehovah,

9. for He is coming to judge the earth. With righteousness He shall judge the world, and the peoples with equity.

## Psalms 99

1. Jehovah reigns; let the peoples tremble! He dwells between the cherubim; let the earth quake!

2. Jehovah is great in Zion, and He has been exalted above all the peoples.

3. Let them praise Your great and awesome name; it is holy.

4. The KingÂ’s strength also loves justice; You have established equity; You have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.

5. Exalt Jehovah our God, and bow down at His footstool; He is holy.

6. Moses and Aaron were among His priests, and Samuel was among those who called upon His name; they called upon Jehovah, and He answered them.

7. He spoke to them in the cloudy pillar; they kept His testimonies and the statutes He gave them.

8. You answered them, O Jehovah our God; You were to them the Mighty God who forgives, though You took vengeance on their deeds.

9. Exalt Jehovah our God, and bow down at His holy hill; for Jehovah our God is holy.

## Psalms 100

__A Psalm of Thanksgiving.__

1. Shout joyfully unto Jehovah, all you lands!

2. Serve Jehovah with gladness; come before His presence with joyful voice.

3. Know that Jehovah, He is God; it is He who has made us, and not we ourselves; we are His people and the sheep of His pasture.

4. Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise. Be thankful unto Him, and bless His name.

5. For Jehovah is good; His mercy is eternal, and His truth endures from generation to generation.

## Psalms 101

__A Psalm of David.__

1. I will sing of mercy and justice; unto You, O Jehovah, will I make music.

2. I will behave wisely in a perfect way. Oh, when will You come to me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.

3. I will set nothing wicked before my eyes; I hate the work of those who fall away; it shall not cling to me.

4. A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will not know evil.

5. Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor, I will annihilate; the one who has a haughty look and a proud heart, I will not endure.

6. My eyes shall be on the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; he who walks in a perfect way shall serve me.

7. He who works deceit shall not dwell within my house; he who tells lies shall not be established in my sight.

8. Early will I destroy all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off all the doers of wickedness from the city of Jehovah.

## Psalms 102

__A prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed and pours out his complaint before Jehovah.__

1. Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, and let my cry come unto You.

2. Hide not Your face from me in the day of my distress; extend Your ear to me; in the day that I call, answer me speedily.

3. For my days have vanished like smoke, and my bones are burned like a firebrand.

4. My heart is stricken and dried up like grass, so that I forget to eat my bread.

5. Because of the sound of my groaning my bones cling to my skin.

6. I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am like an owl of the desert.

7. I am wakeful, and am like a sparrow alone on the housetop.

8. My enemies reproach me all day long, those who are mad at me swear an oath against me.

9. For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,

10. because of Your indignation and Your wrath; for You have taken me up and cast me away.

11. My days are like a shadow that lengthens, and I am dried up like grass.

12. But You, O Jehovah, shall endure forever, and Your remembrance from generation to generation.

13. You will arise and have mercy upon Zion; for the time to favor her, yea, the set time, has come.

14. For Your servants take pleasure in her stones, and show favor to her dust.

15. So the nations shall fear the name of Jehovah, and all the kings of the earth Your glory.

16. For Jehovah shall build up Zion; He shall appear in His glory.

17. He shall turn toward the prayer of the destitute, and shall not despise their prayer.

18. This shall be written for the following generation, that a people yet to be created may praise YAH.

19. For He has looked down from the height of His sanctuary; from Heaven Jehovah has looked upon the earth,

20. to hear the groaning of the prisoner, to set free the children of death,

21. to declare the name of Jehovah in Zion, and His praise in Jerusalem,

22. when the peoples and kingdoms are gathered together to serve Jehovah.

23. He weakened my strength in the way; He shortened my days.

24. I said, O my Mighty God, do not take me away in the midst of my days; Your years are from generation to generation.

25. Of old You laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands.

26. They shall perish, but You will endure; yea, they shall all grow old like a garment; like clothing You will change them, and they shall be changed;

27. but You are the same, and Your years shall not be consumed.

28. The children of Your servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before Your face.

## Psalms 103

__A Psalm of David.__

1. Bless Jehovah, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless His holy name!

2. Bless Jehovah, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits:

3. Who forgives all your iniquities, who heals all your diseases,

4. who redeems your life from destruction, who crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies,

5. who satisfies your mouth with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagleÂ’s.

6. Jehovah executes righteousness and justice for all who are oppressed.

7. He made known His ways to Moses, His acts to the children of Israel.

8. Jehovah is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in mercy.

9. He will not always strive with us, nor will He keep His anger forever.

10. He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor repaid us according to our iniquities.

11. For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is His mercy toward those who fear Him.

12. As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.

13. As a father has compassion on his children, so Jehovah has compassion on those who fear Him.

14. For He knows our frame; He remembers that we are dust.

15. As for man, his days are like grass; as a flower of the field, so he flourishes.

16. And then the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place is noticed no more.

17. But the mercy of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting upon those who fear Him, and His righteousness unto childrenÂ’s children,

18. to such as keep His covenant, and to those who remember His Commandments to do them.

19. Jehovah has established His throne in the heavens, and His kingdom rules over all.

20. Bless Jehovah, you His angels, who excel in strength, who do His Word, heeding the voice of His Word.

21. Bless Jehovah, all you His hosts, you ministers of His, who do His pleasure.

22. Bless Jehovah, all His works, in all places of His dominion. Bless Jehovah, O my soul!

## Psalms 104

1. Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, You are very great: You are clothed with honor and majesty,

2. who covers Yourself with light as with a garment, who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,

3. who lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters, who makes the clouds His chariot, who walks on the wings of the wind,

4. who makes His angels spirits, His ministers a flaming fire.

5. You laid the foundations of the earth, so that it should not be shaken forever.

6. You covered it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.

7. At Your rebuke they fled; at the voice of Your thunder they hurried away.

8. They went up over the mountains; they went down into the valleys, to the place which You have founded for them.

9. You have set a boundary that they may not pass over, that they may not return to cover the earth.

10. He sends the springs into the valleys, they flow among the hills.

11. They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild asses quench their thirst.

12. Over them the birds of the heavens have their dwelling; they utter their voices among the branches.

13. He waters the hills from His upper chambers; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of Your works.

14. He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and vegetation for the service of man, that he may bring forth food out of the earth,

15. and wine that gladdens the heart of man, oil to make his face shine, and bread which strengthens manÂ’s heart.

16. The trees of Jehovah are full, the cedars of Lebanon which He planted,

17. where the birds make their nests; the fir trees, where the stork has her house.

18. The high hills are for the wild goats; the cliffs are a refuge for the hyrax.

19. He appointed the moon for seasons; the sun knows its setting.

20. You make darkness, and it is night, in which all the beasts of the forest creep about.

21. The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from the Mighty God.

22. When the sun rises, they gather together and lie down in their dens.

23. Man goes out to his work and to his labor until the evening.

24. O Jehovah, how manifold are Your works! In wisdom You have made them all. The earth is full of Your possessions;

25. this great and wide sea, in which are innumerable creeping things, living things both small and great.

26. There the ships go; there is that leviathan which You have fashioned to play in it.

27. These all wait upon You, that You may give them their food in due season.

28. What You give them they gather in; You open Your hand, they are filled with good.

29. You hide Your face, they are dismayed; You take away their breath, they die and return to their dust.

30. You send forth Your Spirit, they are created; and You renew the face of the earth.

31. The glory of Jehovah is eternal; Jehovah shall rejoice in His works.

32. He looks upon the earth, and it trembles; He touches the hills, and they smoke.

33. I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live; I will make music unto my God while I have my being.

34. My meditation of Him shall be pleasant; I will be glad in Jehovah.

35. Let sinners be consumed from off the earth, and the wicked be no more. Bless Jehovah, O my soul! Praise YAH!

## Psalms 105

1. Oh, give thanks unto Jehovah! Call upon His name; make known His deeds among the people!

2. Sing unto Him, make music unto Him; talk of all His wondrous works!

3. Glory in His holy name; let the hearts of those rejoice who seek Jehovah!

4. Seek Jehovah and His strength; seek His face continually!

5. Remember His marvelous works which He has done, His wonders, and the justice of His mouth,

6. O seed of Abraham His servant, you children of Jacob, His elect.

7. He is Jehovah our God; His justice is in all the earth.

8. He remembers His covenant forever, the Word which He commanded, to a thousand generations,

9. the covenant which He made with Abraham, and His oath unto Isaac,

10. and confirmed it unto Jacob for a statute, to Israel as a perpetual covenant,

11. saying: To you will I give the land of Canaan as the allotment of your inheritance;

12. when they were but a few men in number, yea very few, and sojourned in it.

13. When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people,

14. He permitted no one to do them wrong; yea, He reproved kings for their sakes,

15. saying, Do not touch My anointed, and do My prophets no harm.

16. Moreover He called for a famine in the land; He broke the whole staff of bread.

17. He sent a man before them; Joseph, who was sold as a slave.

18. They hurt his feet with fetters, he was laid in irons,

19. until the time that his word came to pass. The Word of Jehovah had refined him.

20. The king sent and released him, the ruler of the people let him go free.

21. He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his possessions,

22. to bind his princes at his pleasure, and teach his elders wisdom.

23. Israel also came into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.

24. He increased His people greatly, and made them stronger than their enemies.

25. He turned their heart to hate His people, to deal craftily with His servants.

26. He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron whom He had chosen.

27. They performed His signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.

28. He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they did not rebel against His Word.

29. He turned their waters into blood, and killed their fish.

30. Their land brought forth frogs in swarms, even in the chambers of their kings.

31. He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats in all their territory.

32. He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.

33. He struck their vines also, and their fig trees, and shattered the trees of their territory.

34. He spoke, and locusts came, caterpillars without number,

35. and ate up all the vegetation in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.

36. He also destroyed all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their vigor.

37. He also brought them out with silver and gold, and there was no one feeble among their tribes.

38. Egypt was glad when they departed, for the fear of them had fallen upon them.

39. He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light at night.

40. They asked, and He brought quail, and satisfied them with the bread of Heaven.

41. He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; it ran in the dry places like a river.

42. For He remembered His holy promise, and Abraham His servant.

43. He brought out His people with joy, His elect with gladness.

44. He gave them the lands of the nations, and they inherited the labor of the peoples,

45. that they might keep His statutes and guard His Laws. Praise YAH!

## Psalms 106

1. Praise YAH! O give thanks unto Jehovah, for He is good! For His mercy is eternal.

2. Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah? Who can proclaim all His praise?

3. Blessed are those who keep justice, and he who does righteousness at all times.

4. Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor of Your people; O visit me with Your salvation,

5. that I may see the good of Your elect, that I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, that I may glory with Your inheritance.

6. We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.

7. Our fathers in Egypt did not understand Your wonders; they did not remember the multitude of Your mercies, but rebelled by the sea; the Red Sea.

8. Nevertheless He delivered them for His nameÂ’s sake, that He might make His mighty power known.

9. He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; so He led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.

10. He delivered them from the hand of him who hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

11. The waters covered their enemies; there was not one of them left.

12. Then they believed His Words; they sang His praise.

13. They soon forgot His works; they did not wait for His counsel,

14. but lusted with desire in the wilderness, and tempted the Mighty God in the desert.

15. And He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.

16. When they envied Moses in the camp, and Aaron the saint of Jehovah,

17. the earth opened up and swallowed Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.

18. And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.

19. They made a calf in Horeb, and bowed down to the molten image.

20. Thus they changed their Glory into the image of an ox that eats grass.

21. They forgot the Mighty God their Deliverer, who had done great things in Egypt,

22. wondrous works in the land of Ham, awesome things by the Red Sea.

23. Therefore He said that He would destroy them, had not Moses His elect stood before Him in the breach, to turn away His wrath, so that He should not destroy them.

24. Then they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe His Word,

25. but murmured in their tents, and did not heed the voice of Jehovah.

26. Therefore He raised up His hand and swore against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness,

27. to overthrow their seed among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.

28. They joined themselves also to Baal-Peor, and ate sacrifices to the dead.

29. Thus they provoked Him to anger with their deeds, and the plague broke out upon them.

30. Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was restrained.

31. And it was accounted to him for righteousness from generation to generation forevermore.

32. They angered Him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses on account of them;

33. because they rebelled against His Spirit, so that he spoke rashly with his lips.

34. They did not destroy the peoples as Jehovah had commanded them,

35. but they mingled with the nations and learned their works;

36. they served their idols, which were a snare to them.

37. Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons,

38. and shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.

39. Thus they were defiled with their own works, and went whoring with their deeds.

40. Therefore the wrath of Jehovah was kindled against His people, so that He abhorred His own inheritance.

41. And He gave them into the hand of the nations, and those who hated them ruled over them.

42. Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were humbled under their hand.

43. Many times He delivered them; but they rebelled in their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.

44. Nevertheless He regarded their affliction, when He heard their cry;

45. and remembered His covenant toward them, and was moved to compassion according to the abundance of His mercies.

46. He also gave them compassion before the faces of those who had taken them captive.

47. Deliver us, O Jehovah our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks to Your holy name, to triumph in Your praise.

48. Blessed is Jehovah the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! And let all the people say, Amen! Praise YAH!

## Psalms 107

1. Oh, give thanks unto Jehovah, for He is good; for His mercy is eternal.

2. Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so, whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy,

3. and gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.

4. They wandered in the wilderness in a desolate way; they found no city to dwell in.

5. Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.

6. Then they cried out unto Jehovah in their adversity, and He rescued them out of their distresses.

7. And He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city for a dwelling place.

8. Oh, that men would give thanks unto Jehovah for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the sons of men!

9. For He satisfies the longing soul, and fills the hungry soul with good.

10. Those who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, prisoners in affliction and irons;

11. because they rebelled against the Words of the Mighty God, and despised the counsel of the Most High;

12. therefore He humbled their heart with labor; they fell down, and there was no one to help.

13. Then they cried out unto Jehovah in their adversity, and He delivered them out of their distresses.

14. He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke and tore their bonds apart.

15. Oh, that men would give thanks unto Jehovah for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the sons of men!

16. For He has broken the gates of bronze, and cut the bars of iron in two.

17. Fools, because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.

18. Their soul abhors all kinds of food, and they draw near to the gates of death.

19. Then they cry out unto Jehovah in their adversity, and He delivers them out of their distresses.

20. He sent His Word and healed them, and delivered them from the pit.

21. Oh, that men would give thanks unto Jehovah for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the sons of men!

22. Let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare His works with rejoicing.

23. Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business on great waters,

24. they see the works of Jehovah, and His wonders in the deep.

25. For He commands and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up the waves.

26. They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths; their soul melts because it is bad.

27. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their witsÂ’ end.

28. Then they cry out unto Jehovah in their adversity, and He brings them out of their distresses.

29. He calms the storm, so that its waves are still.

30. Then they are glad because they are quiet; so He guides them to their desired haven.

31. Oh, that men would give thanks unto Jehovah for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the sons of men!

32. Let them exalt Him also in the assembly of the people, and praise Him in the company of the elders.

33. He turns rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into thirsty ground;

34. a fruitful land into barrenness, because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it.

35. He turns a wilderness into pools of water, and dry land into watersprings.

36. There He makes the hungry dwell, that they may establish a city for a dwelling place,

37. and sow fields and plant vineyards, that they may yield a fruitful crop.

38. He also blesses them, and they multiply greatly; and He does not let their cattle decrease.

39. When they are diminished and brought low through oppression, affliction and sorrow,

40. He pours contempt upon nobles, and causes them to wander in the wilderness where there is no path;

41. yet He exalts the poor out of affliction, and makes their families like a flock.

42. The upright see it and rejoice, and all iniquity stops its mouth.

43. Whoever is wise will observe these things, and they shall understand the goodness of Jehovah.

## Psalms 108

__A Song or Psalm of David.__

1. O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and make music, even with my glory.

2. Awake, lute and harp! I will awake at dawn.

3. I will give thanks unto You, O Jehovah, among the peoples, and I will make music unto You among the nations.

4. For Your mercy is great above the heavens, and Your truth unto the clouds.

5. Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, and Your glory above all the earth,

6. that Your beloved may be delivered. Save with Your right hand, and answer me.

7. God has spoken in His holiness: I will rejoice; I will divide Shechem and measure out the Valley of Succoth.

8. Gilead is Mine; Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the protection for My head; Judah is My lawgiver;

9. Moab is My washpot; over Edom I will cast My shoe; over Philistia I will triumph.

10. Who will bring me into the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom?

11. Is it not You, O God, who cast us off? And will You not, O God, go out with our armies?

12. Give us help from adversity, for the help of man is vain.

13. Through God we shall deal with might, for it is He who shall trample our enemies.

## Psalms 109

__To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David.__

1. Do not keep silent, O God of my praise!

2. For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful have opened against me; they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.

3. They have also surrounded me with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.

4. In return for my love they are my adversaries, but I am in prayer.

5. Thus they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.

6. Set a wicked man over him, and let Satan stand at his right hand.

7. When he is judged, let him be found guilty, and let his prayer become sin.

8. Let his days be few, and let another take his office.

9. Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.

10. Let his children continually be vagabonds, and beg; let them seek their bread also from the waste.

11. Let the creditors snare all that he has, and let strangers plunder his labor.

12. Let there be no one to extend mercy to him, nor any to show favor to his fatherless children.

13. Let his posterity be cut off, and in the following generation let their name be blotted out.

14. Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before Jehovah, and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

15. Let them be continually before Jehovah, that He may cut off the memory of them from the earth;

16. because he did not remember to show mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, even to kill the disheartened.

17. As he loved cursing, so let it come upon him; as he did not delight in blessing, so let it be far from him.

18. As he clothed himself with cursing as with his garment, so let it enter his body like water, and like oil into his bones.

19. Let it be to him like the garment which covers him, and for a girdle with which he girds himself continually.

20. Let this be the reward to my adversaries from Jehovah, and to those who speak evil against my soul.

21. But You, O Jehovah the Lord, deal with me for Your nameÂ’s sake; because Your mercy is good, rescue me.

22. For I am lowly and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.

23. I am gone like a shadow when it lengthens; I am shaken off like a locust.

24. My knees totter from fasting, and my flesh has become lean of fatness.

25. I also have become a reproach to them; when they look at me, they shake their heads.

26. Help me, O Jehovah my God! O deliver me according to Your mercy,

27. that they may know that this is Your hand; that You, Jehovah, have done it!

28. Let them curse, but You will bless; when they arise, let them be ashamed, but let Your servant rejoice.

29. Let my adversaries be clothed with disgrace, and let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a cloak.

30. I will give abundant thanks unto Jehovah with my mouth; yes, I will praise Him among the multitude.

31. For He shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those who condemn his soul.

## Psalms 110

__A Psalm of David.__

1. Jehovah said unto my Lord, Sit at My right hand, until I place Your enemies as Your footstool.

2. Jehovah shall send the staff of Your strength out of Zion. Rule in the midst of Your enemies.

3. Your people shall be volunteers in the day of Your power; in the splendor of holiness, from the womb of the dawn, You have the dew of Your youth.

4. Jehovah has sworn and will not regret it: You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.

5. The Lord at Your right hand shall shatter kings in the day of His wrath.

6. He shall judge among the nations, He shall fill them with dead bodies; He shall greatly shatter the heads over the earth.

7. He shall drink of the brook by the wayside; therefore He shall lift up the head.

## Psalms 111

1. Praise YAH! I will praise Jehovah with my whole heart, in the council of the upright and in the congregation.

2. The works of Jehovah are great, sought out by all who have pleasure in them.

3. His work is honorable and glorious, and His righteousness stands eternally.

5. He has given food to those who fear Him; He will always be mindful of His covenant.

6. He has declared to His people the power of His works, to give them the heritage of the nations.

7. The works of His hands are faithfulness and justice; all His precepts are sure.

8. They stand fast forever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.

9. He has sent redemption to His people; He has commanded His covenant forever; holy and awesome is His name.

10. The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all those who do His commandments. His praise stands eternally.

## Psalms 112

1. Praise YAH! Blessed is the man who fears Jehovah, who delights greatly in His Commandments.

2. His seed shall be mighty on the earth; the generation of the upright shall be blessed.

3. Wealth and riches will be in his house, and his righteousness stands forever.

4. Unto the upright there arises light in the darkness; he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.

5. A good man deals graciously and lends; he will guide his affairs with justice.

6. Surely he shall never be shaken; the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.

7. He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is steadfast, trusting in Jehovah.

8. His heart is secure; he will not be afraid, though he sees his adversary.

9. He has dispersed abroad, he has given to the poor; his righteousness stands forever; his horn shall be exalted with honor.

10. The wicked shall see and be indignant; he shall gnash his teeth and melt away; the desire of the wicked shall perish.

## Psalms 113

1. Praise YAH! Praise, O servants of Jehovah, praise the name of Jehovah!

2. Blessed is the name of Jehovah from this time forth and forevermore!

3. From the rising of the sun to its going down JehovahÂ’s name is to be praised.

4. Jehovah is high above all nations, His glory above the heavens.

5. Who is like Jehovah our God, who dwells on high,

6. who humbles Himself to behold the things that are in the heavens and in the earth!

7. He raises the poor out of the dust, and lifts the needy out of the ash heap,

8. that He may seat him with nobles; with the nobles of His people.

9. He causes the barren to dwell in a house, like a joyful mother of children. Praise YAH!

## Psalms 114

1. When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language,

2. Judah was His sanctuary, and Israel His dominion.

3. The sea saw it and fled; Jordan turned back.

4. The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like lambs.

5. What ails you, O sea, that you fled? O Jordan, that you turned back?

6. O mountains, that you skipped like rams? O little hills, like lambs?

7. Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,

8. Who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.

## Psalms 115

1. Not unto us, O Jehovah, not unto us, but to Your name give glory, because of Your mercy, because of Your truth.

2. Why should the nations say, Where now is their God?

3. But our God is in Heaven; He has done whatever He pleased.

4. Their idols are silver and gold, the work of menÂ’s hands.

5. They have mouths, but they do not speak; eyes they have, but they do not see;

6. they have ears, but they do not hear; noses they have, but they do not smell;

7. they have hands, but they do not handle; feet they have, but they do not walk; nor do they utter through their throat.

8. Those who make them are like them; so is everyone who trusts in them.

9. O Israel, trust in Jehovah; He is their help and their shield.

10. O house of Aaron, trust in Jehovah; He is their help and their shield.

11. You who fear Jehovah, trust in Jehovah; He is their help and their shield.

12. Jehovah has been mindful of us; He will bless us; He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron.

13. He will bless those who fear Jehovah, both small and great.

14. Jehovah shall increase you more and more, you and your children.

15. You are blessed by Jehovah, who made the heavens and the earth.

16. Heaven, even the heavens, are JehovahÂ’s; but the earth He has given to the sons of men.

17. The dead do not praise YAH, nor any who go down into silence.

18. But we will bless YAH from this time forth and forevermore. Praise YAH!

## Psalms 116

1. I love Jehovah, because He has heard my voice and my supplications.

2. Because He has extended His ear to me, therefore I will call upon Him all my days.

8. It is better to trust in Jehovah than to put confidence in man.

9. It is better to trust in Jehovah than to put confidence in princes.

10. All the nations have surrounded me, but in the name of Jehovah I will destroy them.

20. This is the gate of Jehovah, through which the righteous shall enter.

21. I will praise You, for You have answered me, and have become my salvation.

## Psalms 120

__A Song of Ascents.__

1. In my distress I have cried out unto Jehovah, and He heard me.

2. Rescue my soul, O Jehovah, from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue.

3. What shall be given to you, or what shall be done to you, O deceitful tongue?

4. Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of the broom tree!

5. Woe is me, that I have sojourned in Meshech, that I have dwelt in the tents of Kedar!

6. My soul has dwelt long with him who hates peace.

7. I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.

## Psalms 121

__A Song of Ascents.__

1. I lift up my eyes from hill to hill. From where does my help come?

2. My help comes from Jehovah, who made the heavens and the earth.

3. He will not allow your foot to slip; He who keeps you will not slumber.

4. Behold, He who keeps Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.

5. Jehovah is your keeper; Jehovah is your shade at your right hand.

6. The sun shall not strike you by day, nor the moon by night.

## Psalms 122

__A Song of Ascents of David.__

1. I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into the house of Jehovah.

2. Our feet shall stand within your gates, O Jerusalem.

3. Jerusalem is built like a city that has been joined together,

4. where the tribes go up, the tribes of YAH, unto the Testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of Jehovah.

5. For thrones are set there for judgment, the thrones of the house of David.

6. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; may they prosper who love you.

__A Song of Ascents.__

3. Have mercy upon us, O Jehovah, have mercy upon us! For we are more than enough held in contempt.

4. Our soul has more than enough of the derision of those who are at ease, with the contempt of the proud who oppress us.

## Psalms 124

__A Song of Ascents of David.__

1. Unless it had been Jehovah who was for us, let Israel now say:

2. Unless it had been Jehovah who was for us, when men rose up against us,

3. then they would have swallowed us alive, when their wrath was kindled against us.

4. Then the waters would have overwhelmed us, the stream would have gone over our soul;

5. then the churning waters would have gone over our soul.

6. Blessed is Jehovah, who has not given us as prey to their teeth.

7. Our soul has escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we have escaped.

8. Our help is in the name of Jehovah, who made the heavens and the earth.

5. As for such as turn aside to their crooked ways, Jehovah shall lead them away with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel!

## Psalms 126

__A Song of Ascents__

1. When Jehovah brought back the captivity of Zion, we were like those who dream.

2. Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with shouts of joy. Then they said among the nations, Jehovah has done great things for them.

3. Jehovah has done great things for us, and we are joyful.

4. Bring back our captivity, O Jehovah, as the streams in the South.

5. Those who sow in tears shall reap in joy.

6. He who goes forth with weeping, bearing seed for sowing, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.

## Psalms 127

__A Song of Ascents for Solomon.__

1. Unless Jehovah builds the house, they labor in vain who build it; unless Jehovah guards the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.

2. It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows; for so He gives His beloved sleep.

3. Behold, children are a heritage from Jehovah, the fruit of the womb is a reward.

4. Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the sons of oneÂ’s youth.

5. Blessed is the man who has his quiver full of them; they shall not be ashamed, but shall speak with their enemies in the gate.

## Psalms 128

__A Song of Ascents.__

1. Blessed is everyone who fears Jehovah, who walks in His ways.

6. Yea, may you see your childrenÂ’s children. Peace be upon Israel!

## Psalms 129

__A Song of Ascents.__

1. Many times they have afflicted me from my youth, let Israel now say:

2. Many times they have afflicted me from my youth; yet they have not prevailed against me.

3. The plowers plowed upon my back; they made their furrows long.

4. Jehovah is righteous; He has cut off the cords of the wicked.

5. Let all those who hate Zion be put to shame and driven back.

6. Let them be as the grass on the housetops, which is dried up before it shoots forth,

7. from which the reaper does not fill his hand, nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom.

8. Neither let those who pass by them say, The blessing of Jehovah be upon you; we bless you in the name of Jehovah.

## Psalms 130

__A Song of Ascents.__

1. Out of the depths have I cried out to You, O Jehovah;

2. Lord, hear my voice. Let Your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.

3. If You, YAH, should keep remembering iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?

4. But there is forgiveness with You, that You may be feared.

5. I have waited for Jehovah, my soul has waited, and in His Word I have hoped.

6. My soul waits for the Lord more than those who watch for the morning; yea, more than those who watch for the morning.

7. O Israel, hope in Jehovah; for with Jehovah there is mercy, and with Him redemption is greatly multiplied.

8. And He will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

## Psalms 131

__A Song of Ascents of David.__

1. Jehovah, my heart is not haughty, nor my eyes lofty. Neither have I walked in great matters, nor in things beyond my understanding.

2. Surely my soul has been calm and quiet, like a child weaned by his mother; my soul is like a weaned child.

3. O Israel, hope in Jehovah from this time and forever.

## Psalms 132

__A Song of Ascents.__

1. O Jehovah, remember David and all his afflictions;

2. how he swore to Jehovah, and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:

3. Surely I will not go into the tent of my house, nor go up into my bed;

4. I will not give sleep to my eyes nor slumber to my eyelids,

5. until I find a place for Jehovah, a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.

6. Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah; we learned of it in the land of the forests.

7. Let us go into His tabernacle; let us bow down at His footstool.

8. Arise, O Jehovah, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength.

9. Let Your priests be clothed with righteousness, and let Your saints shout for joy.

10. For Your servant DavidÂ’s sake, do not turn away the face of Your anointed.

11. Jehovah has sworn in truth unto David; He will not turn from it: I will set upon your throne the fruit of your body.

12. If your sons will keep My Covenant and My Testimony which I shall teach them, their sons also shall sit upon your throne continually.

13. For Jehovah has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His dwelling place.

14. This is My continual resting place; here I will dwell, for I have desired it.

15. I will bless, will bless her provisions; I will satisfy her needy with bread.

16. I will also clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.

17. There will I make the horn of David sprout; I have set in place a lamp for My anointed.

18. His enemies will I clothe with shame, but his crown shall sparkle.

## Psalms 133

__A Song of Ascents of David.__

1. Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!

2. It is like the precious oil upon the head, running down on the beard, the beard of Aaron, running down to the edge of his garments.

3. It is like the dew of Hermon, descending upon the mountains of Zion; for there Jehovah commanded the blessing; life forevermore.

## Psalms 134

__A Song of Ascents.__

1. Behold, bless Jehovah, all you servants of Jehovah, who by night stand in the house of Jehovah.

2. Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless Jehovah.

3. Jehovah, who made the heavens and the earth, bless you out of Zion.

## Psalms 135

1. Praise YAH! Praise the name of Jehovah; praise Him, O you servants of Jehovah!

2. You who stand in the house of Jehovah, in the courts of the house of our God,

3. praise YAH, for Jehovah is good; make music unto His name, for it is delightful.

4. For YAH has chosen Jacob unto Himself, Israel for His valued treasure.

5. For I know that Jehovah is great, and our Lord is above all gods.

6. Whatever Jehovah pleases, He does in the heavens and in earth, in the seas and in all deep places.

7. He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; He makes lightning for the rain; He brings the wind out of His storehouses.

8. He has struck the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.

9. He sent signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh and all his servants.

10. He struck many nations and slew mighty kings;

11. Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan;

12. and gave their land as a heritage, a heritage to Israel His people.

13. Your name, O Jehovah, is eternal, Your remembrance, O Jehovah, from generation to generation.

14. For Jehovah will judge His people, and He will have compassion on His servants.

15. The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of menÂ’s hands.

16. They have mouths, but they do not speak; eyes they have, but they do not see;

17. they have ears, but they do not hear; nor is there any breath in their mouths.

18. Those who make them are like them; everyone who trusts in them.

19. Bless Jehovah, O house of Israel! Bless Jehovah, O house of Aaron!

20. Bless Jehovah, O house of Levi! You who fear Jehovah, bless Jehovah!

21. Blessed is Jehovah out of Zion, who dwells in Jerusalem! Praise YAH!

## Psalms 136

11. and brought out Israel from among them, for His mercy is eternal;

12. with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, for His mercy is eternal;

13. to Him who divided the Red Sea in two, for His mercy is eternal;

14. and made Israel pass through the midst of it, for His mercy is eternal;

15. but overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea, for His mercy is eternal.

16. To Him who led His people through the wilderness, for His mercy is eternal;

17. to Him who struck down great kings, for His mercy is eternal;

18. and slew majestic kings, for His mercy is eternal;

22. a heritage to Israel His servant, for His mercy is eternal.

23. Who remembered us in our lowly state, for His mercy is eternal;

24. and rescued us from our enemies, for His mercy is eternal.

25. Who gives food to all flesh, for His mercy is eternal.

26. O give thanks to the Mighty God of Heaven; for His mercy is eternal.

## Psalms 137

1. By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept when we remembered Zion.

2. We hung our harps upon the willows in the midst of it.

3. For there those who took us captive asked of us a song, and those who plundered us requested mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion!

4. How shall we sing JehovahÂ’s song in a foreign land?

5. If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill.

6. If I do not remember you, let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth, if I do not exalt Jerusalem above my chief joy.

7. Remember, O Jehovah, against the sons of Edom the day of Jerusalem, who said, Raze it, raze it, to its very foundation!

8. O daughter of Babylon, who are to be destroyed, blessed is the one who rewards you as you have dealt out to us.

9. Blessed is the one who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock.

__A Psalm of David.__

1. I will give thanks unto You with my whole heart; before the gods I will make music unto You.

2. I will bow down toward Your holy temple, and give thanks unto Your name for Your lovingkindness and Your truth; for You have magnified Your Word above all Your name.

4. All the kings of the earth shall give thanks unto You, O Jehovah, when they hear the Words of Your mouth.

5. Yea, they shall sing of the ways of Jehovah, for great is the glory of Jehovah.

6. Though Jehovah is on high, yet He gives attention to the lowly; but the proud He recognizes from afar.

7. Though I walk in the midst of distress, You will revive me; You will stretch out Your hand against the wrath of my enemies, and Your right hand will deliver me.

8. Jehovah will perfect that which concerns me; Your mercy, O Jehovah, is eternal; do not forsake the works of Your hands.

## Psalms 139

__To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David.__

1. O Jehovah, You have searched me and known me.

2. You know my sitting down and my rising up; You understand my thoughts afar off.

3. You have sifted through my way of life and my lying down, and are familiar with all my ways.

4. For there is not a word on my tongue, but behold, O Jehovah, You know it altogether.

5. You have hedged me behind and before, and laid Your hand upon me.

6. Such knowledge is incomprehensible to me; it is high, I am not able to reach it.

7. Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?

8. If I ascend into the heavens, You are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, behold, You are there.

9. If I take the wings of the dawn, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,

10. even there Your hand shall lead me, and Your right hand shall take hold of me.

11. If I say, Surely the darkness shall fall upon me, even the night shall be light round about me;

12. yea, the darkness shall not hide from You, but the night shines as the day; the darkness and the light are both alike to You.

13. For You have possessed my inward parts; You covered me in my motherÂ’s womb.

14. I will give thanks unto You, for I am awesomely and wonderfully made; marvelous are Your works, and my soul knows it very well.

15. My frame was not hidden from You when I was made in secret, and skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.

16. Your eyes saw my embryo, and in Your book I was enrolled, and all my days had been preordained, when as yet there was nothing.

17. How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O Mighty God! How great is the sum of them!

18. If I should count them, they are more numerous than the sand; when I awake, I am still with You.

19. Surely You will slay the wicked, O God! Depart from me, you men of blood.

20. For they speak against You maliciously; Your enemies are lifted up with vanity.

21. Do I not hate them, O Jehovah, who hate You? And do I not loathe those who rise up against You?

22. I hate them with complete hatred; I count them my enemies.

23. Search me, O Mighty God, and know my heart; try me, and know my anxieties;

24. and find out if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way eternal.

## Psalms 140

__To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David.__

1. Rescue me, O Jehovah, from evil men; guard me against violent men,

2. who have devised evil things in their hearts; they continually gather together for war.

3. They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; the poison of vipers is under their lips. Selah

4. Keep me, O Jehovah, from the hands of the wicked; guard me against violent men, who have devised to overthrow my steps.

5. The proud have hidden a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have laid the bait for me. Selah

6. I said unto Jehovah, You are my Mighty God; hear the voice of my supplications, O Jehovah.

7. O Lord Jehovah, the strength of my salvation, You have covered my head in the day of battle.

8. Do not grant, O Jehovah, the desires of the wicked; do not promote his evil plans, lest they be exalted. Selah

9. As for the head of those who surround me, let the evil of their lips cover them;

10. let burning coals fall upon them; let them be cast into the fire, into deep pits, that they rise not up again.

11. Let not a man who speaks evil be established in the earth; evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.

12. I know that Jehovah will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and justice for the poor.

13. Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto Your name; the upright shall dwell in Your presence.

## Psalms 141

__A Psalm of David.__

1. Jehovah, I cry out unto You: Make haste to me, give ear to my voice when I cry out unto You!

2. Let my prayer be set before You as incense, the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.

3. Set a guard, O Jehovah, before my mouth; keep watch over the door of my lips.

4. Let not my heart be inclined to evil speech, to practice wicked deeds with men who do iniquity; and let me not eat of their delicacies.

5. Let the righteous strike me; it shall be a kindness. And let him rebuke me; it shall be as choicest oil; let my head not refuse it. For still my prayer is against the evil.

6. Their judges have been overthrown by the hand of our Rock; they have heard my words, for they have been sweet.

7. Our bones are scattered at the mouth of the grave, as when one cuts and splits wood on the earth.

8. But my eyes are upon You, O Lord Jehovah; in You I have taken refuge; do not leave my soul destitute.

9. Keep me from the snares they have laid for me, and from the traps of the workers of iniquity.

10. Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass on in one piece.

## Psalms 142

__Maschil of David. A Prayer when he was in the cave.__

1. I cry out unto Jehovah with my voice; with my voice unto Jehovah I make my supplication.

2. I pour out my meditation before Him; I make known before His face my distress.

3. When my spirit was faint within me, then You knew my path. In the way in which I walk they have hidden a snare for me.

4. Look on my right hand and see, for there is no one who acknowledges me; refuge has vanished from me; no one cares for my soul.

5. I cried out unto You, O Jehovah: I said, You are my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.

6. Give attention to my cry, for I am brought very low; rescue me from my persecutors, for they are stronger than I.

7. Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto Your name; the righteous shall surround me, for You shall deal bountifully with me.

## Psalms 143

__A Psalm of David.__

1. Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, give ear to my supplications! In Your faithfulness and righteousness answer me.

2. Do not enter into judgment with Your servant, for in Your sight no one living is just.

3. For the enemy has persecuted my soul; he has crushed my life to the ground; he has made me dwell in darkness, like those long dead.

4. Therefore my spirit is faint within me; my heart within me is desolate.

5. I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Your works; I muse on the works of Your hands.

6. I have spread my hands toward You; my soul is like a weary land. Selah

7. Answer me speedily, O Jehovah; my spirit wastes away! Do not hide Your face from me, lest I be like those who go down into the pit.

8. Cause me to hear Your lovingkindness in the morning, for in You do I trust; cause me to know the way in which I should walk, for I lift up my soul unto You.

9. Rescue me, O Jehovah, from my enemies; in You I have taken cover.

10. Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God; Your Spirit is good. Lead me into the land of uprightness.

11. Revive me, O Jehovah, for Your nameÂ’s sake! For Your righteousnessÂ’sake bring my soul out of distress.

12. In Your mercy cut off my enemies, and destroy all those who afflict my soul; for I am Your servant.

## Psalms 144

__A Psalm of David.__

1. Blessed is Jehovah my Rock, who teaches my hands for war, and my fingers for battle;

2. my goodness and my stronghold, my refuge and my deliverer, my shield and the One in whom I trust, who subdues my people under me.

3. Jehovah, what is man, that You take knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that You are mindful of him?

4. Man is like a breath; his days are like a shadow that vanishes.

5. Bow down Your heavens, O Jehovah, and come down; touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.

6. Cast forth lightning and scatter them; shoot out Your arrows and destroy them.

7. Extend Your hand from above; rescue me and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of the sons of foreigners,

8. whose mouth speaks vanity, and whose right hand is a right hand of deception.

9. I will sing a new song unto You, O God; upon a lute and an instrument of ten strings I will make music unto You,

10. the One who gives deliverance to kings; who rescues David His servant from the evil sword.

11. Rescue me and deliver me from the hand of the sons of foreigners, whose mouth speaks vanity, and whose right hand is a right hand of deception;

12. that our sons may be as plants brought up in their youth; that our daughters may be like corner stones, carved in the form of a palace;

13. that our granaries may be full, furnishing kind to kind; and our flocks may bring forth thousands and ten thousands outside;

14. that our oxen may be laden; that there be no breaking in or going out; that there be no outcry in our streets.

15. Blessed are the people who are like this; blessed are the people whose God is Jehovah!

## Psalms 145

__A Praise of David.__

1. I will extol You, my God, O King; and I will bless Your name forever and ever.

2. Every day I will bless You, and I will praise Your name forever and ever.

4. One generation shall praise Your works to another, and shall declare Your mighty acts.

5. I will meditate on the glorious splendor of Your majesty, and on Your wondrous works.

6. Men shall speak of the might of Your awesome acts, and I will declare Your greatness.

7. They shall pour forth the memory of Your great goodness, and shall shout of Your righteousness.

8. Jehovah is gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger and great in kindness.

9. Jehovah is good to all, and His compassions are over all His works.

10. All Your works shall give thanks to You, O Jehovah, and Your saints shall bless You.

11. They shall speak of the glory of Your kingdom, and talk of Your power,

12. to make known to the sons of men His mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of His kingdom.

13. Your kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and Your dominion is from generation to generation.

14. Jehovah upholds all who fall, and raises up all who are bowed down.

16. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing.

17. Jehovah is righteous in all His ways, and kind in all His works.

18. Jehovah is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth.

19. He will fulfill the desire of those who fear Him; He also will hear their cry and save them.

20. Jehovah preserves all who love Him, but all the wicked He will destroy.

21. My mouth shall speak the praise of Jehovah, and all flesh shall bless His holy name forever and ever.

## Psalms 146

1. Praise YAH! Praise Jehovah, O my soul!

2. While I live I will praise Jehovah; I will make music unto my God while I have my being.

3. Do not put your trust in princes, nor in a son of man, in whom there is no help.

4. His spirit departs, he returns to the earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.

5. Blessed is he who has the Mighty God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in Jehovah his God,

6. who made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them; who keeps truth forever,

7. who executes justice for the oppressed, who gives food to the hungry. Jehovah lets loose the prisoners.

8. Jehovah opens the eyes of the blind; Jehovah raises those who are bowed down; Jehovah loves the righteous.

9. Jehovah watches over the sojourners; He relieves the fatherless and widow; but the way of the wicked He turns upside down.

10. Jehovah shall reign forever; Your God, O Zion, from generation to generation. Praise YAH!

10. He does not delight in the strength of the horse; He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.

11. Jehovah takes pleasure in those who fear Him, in those who hope in His mercy.

12. Praise Jehovah, O Jerusalem! Boast in your God, O Zion!

13. For He has strengthened the bars of your gates; He has blessed your children within you.

14. He makes peace in your borders, and fills you with the finest wheat.

15. He sends forth His command upon the earth; His Word runs very swiftly.

16. He gives snow like wool; He scatters the frost like ashes;

17. He casts out His hail like morsels; who can stand before His cold?

18. He sends out His Word and melts them; He causes His wind to blow, and the waters flow.

19. He declares His Word unto Jacob, His Statutes and His justice unto Israel.

20. He has not dealt thus with any other nation; and they have not known His justice. Praise YAH!

9. mountains and all hills; fruitful trees and all cedars;

10. beasts and all cattle; creeping things and birds on the wing;

11. kings of the earth and all peoples; princes and all judges of the earth;

12. both young men and maidens; old men and children:

4. For Jehovah takes pleasure in His people; He will glorify the lowly with salvation.

5. Let the saints be joyful in glory; let them shout aloud upon their beds.

6. Let the exaltation of the Mighty God be in their throat, and a two-edged sword in their hand,
