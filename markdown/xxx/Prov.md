## Proverbs 1

1. The Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:

2. To know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;

3. to receive instruction in wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;

4. to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young man.

5. The wise hears and increases learning, and the one of understanding gets wise counsel,

6. to understand a proverb and an enigma; the words of the wise, and their difficult sayings.

7. The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction.

8. My son, hear the instruction of your father, and do not forsake the law of your mother;

9. for they shall be an ornament of grace to your head, and chains around your neck.

10. My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.

11. If they say, Walk with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause,

12. let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, and whole, as those who go down into the Pit,

13. we shall find all sorts of precious stuff, we shall fill our houses with plunder;

14. cast in your lot among us, let us all have one purse.

15. My son, do not walk in the way with them! Withhold your foot from their path;

16. for their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed blood.

17. Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.

18. And they lie in wait for their own blood; they lurk secretly for their own souls.

19. So are the ways of everyone who gets unjust gain; it takes away the soul of its master.

20. Wisdom cries aloud outside; she utters her voice in the square;

21. she calls out over the tumult; at the openings of the gates, in the city she utters her words:

22. How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity; and those who scorn desire their scorning; and fools hate knowledge?

23. Turn back at my reproof; behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you; I will make my words known to you.

24. Because I have called, and you refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one pays attention,

25. but you have ignored all my counsel, and have not desired my reproof:

26. I also will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your terror comes;

27. when your terror comes like a storm; and your devastation arrives like a tempest, when distress and anguish come upon you.

28. Then they shall call upon me, and I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me.

29. Because they hated knowledge and chose not the fear of Jehovah.

30. They did not desire my counsel; they despised all my reproof.

31. Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices.

32. For the turning away of the simple kills them, and the ease of fools destroys them.

33. But whoever listens to me shall live in confidence, and shall rest securely from the dread of evil.

## Proverbs 2

1. My son, if you will receive my words, and treasure up my commandments within you,

2. so that you incline your ear to wisdom, and extend your heart to understanding;

3. yes, if you cry out for discernment, lifting up your voice for understanding;

4. if you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures,

5. then you shall understand the fear of Jehovah, and find the knowledge of God.

6. For Jehovah gives wisdom; out of His mouth come knowledge and understanding.

7. He lays up sound wisdom for the upright; a shield to those who walk in integrity,

8. to guard the paths of judgment; and He keeps watch over the way of His saints.

9. Then you shall understand righteousness and justice and equity and every good path.

10. When wisdom enters into your heart, and knowledge is pleasant to your soul,

11. discretion shall keep watch over you, understanding shall guard you,

12. to deliver you from the way of evil, from the man who speaks perverse things,

13. those who leave the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,

14. who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the perversities of the wicked,

15. whose paths are crooked, who are devious in their tracks;

16. to deliver you from the strange woman, from the foreigner who flatters with her words,

17. who forsakes the guide of her youth and has forgotten the covenant of her God.

18. For her house leads down to death, and her tracks to the spirits of the dead.

19. No one going in to her returns, nor do they attain unto the ways of life.

20. That you may walk in the ways of the good and keep the ways of the righteous.

21. For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.

22. But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and those who act deceitfully shall be rooted out of it.

## Proverbs 3

1. My son, do not forget my law, but let your heart keep my commandments,

2. for they shall add length of days and long life and peace to you.

3. Let not mercy and truth forsake you; tie them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart;

4. so you shall find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.

5. Trust in Jehovah with all your heart, and lean not unto your own understanding.

6. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.

7. Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear Jehovah and depart from evil.

8. It shall be healing to your navel and refreshment to your bones.

9. Honor Jehovah with your substance, and with the firstfruits of all your increase,

10. and your barns shall be filled with plenty, and your vats shall be bursting with new wine.

11. My son, do not reject the chastening of Jehovah, and do not loathe His correction;

12. for whom Jehovah loves He corrects, even as a father corrects the son with whom he is pleased.

13. Happy is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gets understanding;

14. for its profit is better than the gain from silver, and its increase more than fine gold.

15. She is more precious than rubies, and all the things you can desire are not to be compared with her.

16. Length of days is in her right hand, riches and honor in her left hand.

17. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.

18. She is a tree of life to those who lay hold upon her, and happy is everyone who holds fast to her.

19. Jehovah has founded the earth by wisdom; He has established the heavens by understanding;

20. the depths were broken up by His knowledge, and the clouds drop down the dew.

21. My son, do not let them depart from your eyes; keep sound wisdom and discretion,

22. and they shall be life to your soul, and grace to your neck;

23. then you shall walk in your way safely, and your foot shall not stumble.

24. When you lie down, you shall not be in dread; yea, you shall lie down and your sleep shall be sweet.

25. Do not be afraid of sudden terror, nor of the devastation of the wicked when it comes.

26. For Jehovah shall be at your side, and He shall keep your foot from being caught.

27. Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.

28. Do not say to your neighbor, Go and come back again, and tomorrow I will give, when you have it with you.

29. Do not devise evil against your neighbor, since he dwells by you securely.

30. Do not strive with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm.

31. Do not be envious of the violent man, and choose none of his ways;

32. for the perverse one is an abomination to Jehovah, but His secret counsel is with the upright.

33. The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked, but He blesses the abode of the just.

34. Surely He scorns the scorners, but He gives grace to the lowly.

35. The wise inherit honor, but the exaltation of fools is shame.

## Proverbs 4

1. Children, hear the instruction of a father, and pay attention to know understanding,

2. for I give you good teaching; do not forsake my law.

3. For I was my fatherÂ’s son, tender and an only one in the sight of my mother.

4. And he taught me and said to me, Let your heart cling to my words; keep my commandments and live.

5. Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth.

6. Do not forsake her, and she will preserve you; love her, and she will keep you.

7. The first thing about wisdom is: Get wisdom. And with all your getting, get understanding.

8. Exalt her, and she will lift you up; she shall bring you to honor when you embrace her.

9. She shall bestow a wreath of grace upon your head; she shall give you a crown of glory.

10. Oh my son, hear and receive my sayings, and the years of your life shall be many.

11. I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in straight tracks;

12. when you go, your steps shall not be constricted, and when you run, you shall not stumble.

13. Take fast hold of instruction, do not let her go; keep her, for she is your life.

14. Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not go in the way of evil.

15. Avoid it, do not pass by it; turn from it and pass on.

16. For they do not sleep unless they have done evil, and their sleep is taken away unless they cause someone to fall.

17. For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.

18. But the path of the just is as the brightness of dawn, that keeps getting brighter until it is fully daytime.

19. The way of the wicked is as darkness; they do not know at what they stumble.

20. My son, pay attention to my sayings; extend your ear to my words;

21. let them not depart from your eyes; keep them in the center of your heart;

22. for they are life to those who find them, and health to all their flesh.

23. Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life.

24. Turn away from you the crooked mouth, and put perverse lips far from you.

25. Let your eyes look straight ahead, and let your eyelids look straight before you.

26. Ponder the path of your feet, then all your ways will be established.

27. Do not turn to the right hand or to the left; remove your foot from evil.

## Proverbs 5

1. My son, pay attention to my wisdom; extend your ear to my understanding;

2. so that you may keep discretion, and your lips may guard knowledge.

3. For the lips of a strange woman drip honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil,

4. but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a cleaver;

5. her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on Sheol;

6. lest you should ponder the path of life, her paths are unstable; you cannot know them.

7. Therefore hear me now, O children, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.

8. Remove your ways far from her, and do not come near the door of her house,

9. lest you give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel;

10. that strangers not be filled with your strength, nor your labors be in the house of a foreigner,

11. and you moan in the end, when your flesh and body are spent;

12. and say, How I have hated instruction, and my heart despised correction;

13. and I have not given heed to the voice of my teachers, nor extended my ear to those instructing me.

14. I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.

15. Drink waters out of your own cistern, and running waters out of your own well.

16. Should your springs be dispersed abroad, like streams of water in the streets?

17. Let them be only your own, and not for strangers with you.

18. Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of your youth,

19. as a loving deer and a graceful doe, let her breasts satisfy you at all times, and always be intoxicated in her love.

20. For why, my son, will you be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a foreigner?

21. For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah, and He ponders all his tracks.

22. His own iniquities shall capture the wicked, and he shall be held with the cords of his sin.

23. He shall die without instruction, and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.

## Proverbs 6

1. My son, if you are surety for your friend, if you have struck your hands with a stranger,

2. you are snared with the words of your mouth; you are captured with the words of your mouth.

3. My son, do this then, and deliver yourself when you come into the hand of your friend: go humble yourself and entreat your friend.

4. Do not give sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids.

5. Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.

6. Go to the ant, you sluggard! Consider her ways and be wise;

7. who, having no commander, overseer or ruler,

8. provides her bread in the summer, and gathers her food in the harvest.

9. How long will you rest, O sluggard? When will you arise out of your sleep?

10. A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest;

11. so shall your poverty come as one walking, and your need like an armed man.

12. A worthless person, a wicked man, walks with a perverse mouth,

13. winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, pointing with his fingers.

14. Perversity is in his heart, he devises evil all the time, he spreads strife.

15. Therefore his calamity shall come suddenly; he shall be broken in an instant without remedy.

16. These six things Jehovah hates; yea, seven are an abomination to his soul:

17. Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,

18. a heart that devises evil plans, feet hurrying to run to evil,

19. a false witness who breathes lies, and he who spreads strife among brothers.

20. My son, keep your fatherÂ’s commands, and do not forsake the instruction of your mother.

21. Bind them perpetually to your heart; tie them around your neck.

22. When you go, it shall lead you; when you sleep, it shall watch over you; and when you awake, it will speak with you.

23. For the commandment is a lamp, and the law a light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life,

24. to keep you from the evil woman, from the seductiveness of the foreign tongue.

25. Do not lust after her beauty in your heart, and do not let her captivate you with her eyelids.

26. For on account of a promiscuous woman, a man comes to a loaf of bread; for the manÂ’s wife hunts for the precious soul.

27. Can a man take fire into his bosom and his clothes not be burned?

28. Or can a man walk on hot coals and his feet not be scorched?

29. So is he who goes in to his neighborÂ’s wife; whoever touches her shall not be innocent.

30. They do not despise a thief, if he steals to satisfy his soul when he is hungry.

31. But if he is found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the wealth of his house.

32. He who commits adultery with a woman lacks heart; he who does so destroys his own soul.

33. Wounds and dishonor shall befall him, and his reproach shall not be wiped away.

34. For jealousy is the rage of a man, and he will not spare in the day of vengeance.

35. He will not regard any bribes, nor will he yield to the giving of many gifts.

## Proverbs 7

1. My son, keep my words and treasure up my commandments within you.

2. Keep my commandments and live, and my law as the pupil of your eye.

3. Tie them upon your fingers; write them upon the tablet of your heart.

4. Say to wisdom, You are my sister, and call understanding your kinsman,

5. that they may keep you from the strange woman, from the foreigner who makes smooth her words.

6. For I looked through my lattice, at the window of my house,

7. and I saw among the simple ones, I observed among the children a young man lacking heart,

8. passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,

9. in the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the middle of the darkness of night.

10. And behold, a woman came to meet him, with the attire of a harlot, and a heart of secrecy.

11. (She is boisterous and stubborn; her feet do not settle down in her own house.

12. At one moment she is outside, the next in the streets, and she lies in wait at every corner.)

13. So she has seized him and kissed him; and with straight face says to him,

14. Regarding my peace offerings, today I have completed my vows;

15. therefore I came out to meet you, earnestly to seek your face, and I have found you.

16. I have spread my bed with coverings, with striped cloths of linen from Egypt.

17. I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon.

18. Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; let us delight ourselves with lovemaking.

19. For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey.

20. He has taken in hand a bag of money, and will come home on the day of the full moon.

21. With great persuasion she influences him; with her seductive lips she moves him.

22. In an instant he goes after her, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or as a fool goes to correction in fetters;

23. till an arrow strikes through his liver, as a bird hastens to the snare; and does not realize that it is for his soul.

24. Now then, listen to me, O sons, and pay attention to the words of my mouth:

25. Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways; do not go astray in her paths.

26. For many are the wounded she has caused to fall, and countless are the ones slain by her.

27. Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the rooms of death.

## Proverbs 8

1. Does not wisdom call out? And does not understanding put forth her voice?

2. She stands at the top of high places, by the wayside, where the paths meet,

3. beside the gates; at the opening to the city, at the doors of entry, she cries aloud:

4. I call out to you, O men, and my voice is to the sons of men.

5. Understand wisdom, you simple ones; and you fools, be of an understanding heart.

6. Listen, for I will speak of excellent things, and from the opening of my lips shall be right things.

7. For my mouth shall utter truth, and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.

8. All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; nothing crooked or perverse is in them;

9. they are all plain to the one who understands; and right to those who find knowledge.

10. Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge, rather than choice gold.

11. For wisdom is better than jewels, and all delightful things cannot be compared to it.

12. I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, and I find out the knowledge of devices.

13. The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, and the evil way, and the perverse mouth.

14. Counsel and sound wisdom are mine; I am understanding; I have strength.

15. By me kings reign, and judges decree justice.

16. Rulers and nobles rule by me; even all the judges of the earth.

17. I love those who love me, and those who seek me early find me.

18. Riches and honor are with me; enduring wealth and righteousness.

19. My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.

20. I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice;

21. to cause those who love me to inherit substance, and I will fill up their treasuries.

22. Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of His way; His works from antiquity.

23. I was anointed from eternity, from the beginning, before the earth.

24. When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no springs abounding with water.

25. Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, I was brought forth;

26. before He had made the earth and the fields, or the highest part of the dust of the world.

27. When He established the heavens, I was there; when He inscribed a circle upon the face of the deep,

28. when He made firm the clouds above, when He made strong the fountains of the deep,

29. when He gave to the sea its limit, that the waters should not pass beyond His command; when He engraved the foundations of the earth,

30. then I was at His side, like a master workman; and I was His delight day by day, being in merriment before Him at all times;

31. making merry in the world, His earth; and my delight was with the sons of men.

32. Now therefore listen to me, O children, for blessed are those who keep my ways.

33. Hear instruction, and be wise, and do not refuse it.

34. Blessed is the man who gives heed to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.

35. For whoever finds me finds life, and shall obtain favor from Jehovah.

36. But he who sins against me does violence to his own soul; all who hate me love death.

## Proverbs 9

1. Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn out her seven pillars;

2. she has slaughtered her meat; she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table.

3. She has sent out her maidens; she calls out from the highest places of the city:

4. Whoever is simple, turn in here; and to the one lacking heart, she says to him:

5. Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine that I have mixed.

6. Forsake simplicity, and live; and go in the way of understanding.

7. He who reproves a scorner gets shame to himself; and he who rebukes a wicked man gets himself a blemish.

8. Do not reprove a scorner, lest he hate you; rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.

9. Give to a wise one, and he will become wiser; teach a just one, and he will increase in learning.

10. The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.

11. For by me your days shall be multiplied, and the years of your life shall be increased.

12. If you are wise, you shall be wise for yourself, and if you scorn, you alone shall bear it.

13. A foolish woman is boisterous; she is naive, and knows nothing.

14. And she sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,

15. to call out to those who pass by, who are going straight on their ways:

16. Whoever is simple, let him turn in here; and to the one lacking heart, she says to him:

17. Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.

18. But he does not know that the spirits of the dead are there; the ones she summons are in the depths of Sheol.

## Proverbs 10

1. The proverbs of Solomon: A wise son makes a father rejoice, but a foolish son is a grief to his mother.

2. Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, but righteousness delivers from death.

3. Jehovah will not allow the soul of the righteous to go hungry, but He thrusts away the desire of the wicked.

4. He who works with a slack hand becomes poor, but the hand of the diligent makes rich.

14. The wise treasure up knowledge, but the mouth of the fool is near destruction.

15. The rich manÂ’s wealth is his strong city; the destruction of the poor is their poverty.

16. The labor of the righteous is life; the gain of the wicked is sin.

17. He who heeds instruction is in the way of life, but he who forsakes reproof wanders.

18. He who hides hatred with lying lips, and he who sends out a slander, is a fool.

19. In the abundance of words there is no end of transgression, but he who restrains his lips is prudent.

20. The tongue of the just is as choice silver; the heart of the wicked is as little.

21. The lips of the righteous feed many, but fools die for lack of heart.

22. The blessing of Jehovah, it makes rich, with no sorrow added.

23. It is as jest to a fool to do wickedness; so is wisdom to a man of understanding.

24. That which the wicked fears shall come upon him, but the desire of the righteous is granted.

25. As the storm passes, so the wicked is no more; but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.

26. Like vinegar to the teeth, and like smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to those who send him.

27. The fear of Jehovah prolongs days, but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.
