## Ezekiel 1

1. Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the River Chebar, that the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.

2. On the fifth day of the month, which was in the fifth year of King Jehoiachins captivity,

3. the Word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans, by the River Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah was upon him there.

4. And I looked, and behold, a whirlwind was coming out of the north, a great cloud with flashing fire in it; and brightness was all around it and radiating out of its midst like the color of amber, out of the midst of the fire.

5. Also from within it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.

6. Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings.

7. Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the soles of calves feet. They sparkled like the color of burnished bronze.

8. And the hands of a man were under their wings on their four sides; and each of the four had faces and wings.

9. Their wings joined one to another. They did not turn when they went, but each one went straight forward.

10. As for the likeness of their faces, each had the face of a man; each of the four had the face of a lion on the right side, each of the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and each of the four had the face of an eagle.

11. Thus were their faces. Their wings stretched upward; two wings of each one were joined to one another, and two covered their bodies.

12. And each one went straight forward; they went wherever the spirit was to go, and they did not turn when they went.

13. As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches going back and forth among the living creatures. The fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.

14. And the living creatures were running and returning, in appearance like a flash of lightning.

15. Now as I looked at the living creatures, behold, a wheel was on the earth beside the living creatures with its four faces.

16. The appearance of the wheels and their workmanship was like the color of beryl, and all four had the same likeness. The appearance of their workmanship was, as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel.

17. When they moved, they went toward any one of four directions; they did not change directions as they went.

18. As for their rims, they were so high that they were awesome; and their rims were full of eyes, all around the four of them.

19. When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.

20. Wherever the spirit was to go, there they went, where the spirit went; and the wheels were lifted up alongside them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.

21. When those went, these went; when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up alongside them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.

22. The likeness of the expanse above the heads of the living creatures was like the color of an awesome crystal, stretched out above over their heads.

23. And under the expanse their wings spread out straight, one toward another. Each one had two which covered one side, and each one had two which covered the other side of their bodies.

24. When they went, I heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of many waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a tumult like the sound of an army; and when they stood still, they let down their wings.

25. And there was a voice from the expanse that was over their heads; whenever they stood, they let down their wings.

26. And above the expanse over their heads was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like a sapphire stone; on the likeness of the throne was a likeness with the appearance of a man high above it.

27. Also from the appearance of His waist and upward I saw, as it were, the color of amber with the appearance of fire all around within it; and from the appearance of His waist and downward I saw, as it were, the appearance of fire with brightness all around.

28. As the appearance of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the brightness all around it. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. So when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of One speaking.

## Ezekiel 2

1. And He said to me, Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you.

2. Then the Spirit entered me when He spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard Him speak to me.

3. And He said to me: Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day.

4. For they are impudent and hardhearted children. I am sending you to them, and you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah.

5. As for them, whether they hear or whether they forbear; for they are a rebellious house; yet they will know that a prophet has been among them.

6. And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you and you dwell among scorpions; do not be afraid of their words or dismayed by their looks, though they are a rebellious house.

7. You shall speak My Words to them, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear, for they are most rebellious.

8. But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.

9. And when I looked, behold, there was a hand stretched out to me; and lo, a scroll of a book was in it.

10. And He spread it before me; and there was writing on the inside and on the outside, and written on it were lamentations and mourning and woe.

## Ezekiel 3

1. Moreover He said to me, Son of man, eat what you find; eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.

2. So I opened my mouth, and He caused me to eat the scroll.

3. And He said to me, Son of man, feed your belly, and fill your stomach with this scroll that I give you. So I ate, and it was in my mouth like honey for sweetness.

4. Then He said to me: Son of man, Go. Come to the house of Israel and speak My Words to them.

5. For you are not sent to a people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language, but to the house of Israel,

6. not to many people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, had I sent you to them, they would have listened to you.

7. But the house of Israel is not willing to listen to you, because they are not willing to listen to Me; for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.

8. Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads.

9. Like adamant stone, harder than flint, I have made your forehead; do not be afraid of them, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.

10. Moreover He said to me: Son of man, receive into your heart all My Words that I speak to you, and hear with your ears.

11. And go! Come to the captives, to the children of your people, and speak to them and tell them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.

12. Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a great thunderous voice: Blessed is the glory of Jehovah from His place!

13. I also heard the sound of the wings of the living creatures touching one another, and the sound of the wheels alongside them, and a great thunderous sound.

14. So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.

15. Then I came to the captives at Tel Abib, who dwelt by the River Chebar; and I sat where they sat, and remained there in shock among them seven days.

16. Now it came to pass at the end of seven days that the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

17. Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore hear the Word from My mouth, and give them warning from Me:

18. When I say to the wicked, You shall die the death, and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, that same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand.

19. Yet, if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.

20. Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die. Because you did not give him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand.

21. Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man that the righteous should not sin, and he does not sin, he shall live life because he took warning; and you have delivered your soul.

22. And the hand of Jehovah was upon me there, and He said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and there I will talk with you.

23. So I arose and went forth into the plain. And behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, like the glory which I saw by the River Chebar; and I fell on my face.

24. Then the Spirit entered into me and stood me on my feet, and spoke with me and said to me: Go, shut yourself inside your house.

25. But you, O son of man, behold, they shall put ropes on you and bind you with them, and you shall not go out among them.

26. And I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be mute and not be one rebuking them, for they are a rebellious house.

27. But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah. He who hears, let him hear; and he who forbears, let him forbear; for they are a rebellious house.

## Ezekiel 4

1. You also, son of man, take a clay tablet and lay it before you, and engrave on it a city, Jerusalem.

2. And lay siege against it, build a siege wall against it, and heap up a mound against it; set camps against it also, and place battering rams against it all around.

3. Moreover take for yourself an iron plate, and set it as an iron wall between you and the city. Set your face against it, and it shall be under siege, and you shall lay siege against it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.

4. Lie also on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it. According to the number of the days that you lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity.

5. For I have laid on you the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days; so you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.

6. And when you have completed them, lie again on your right side; then you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days. I have laid on you a day for each year.

7. Therefore you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem; your arm shall be uncovered, and you shall prophesy against it.

8. And surely I will put bands on you so that you cannot turn from one side to another till you have completed the days of your siege.

9. Also take for yourself wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt; put them into one vessel, and make bread of them for yourself, according to the number of days that you lie on your side; three hundred and ninety days, you shall eat it.

10. And your food which you eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; from time to time you shall eat it.

11. You shall also drink water by measure, one-sixth of a hin; from time to time you shall drink.

12. And you shall eat it as barley cakes; and bake it using dung of human excrement, in their eyes.

13. And Jehovah said, Even so shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, where I will drive them.

14. So I said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! Behold, my soul has never been defiled from my youth till now; I have never eaten a carcass or a torn animal, nor has abominable flesh ever come into my mouth.

15. Then He said to me, See, I am giving you cow manure instead of human dung, and you shall prepare your bread over it.

16. Moreover He said to me, Son of man, behold, I will cut off the food supply in Jerusalem; and they shall eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and shall drink water by measure and in horror,

17. that they may lack bread and water, and be appalled with one another, and waste away because of their iniquity.

## Ezekiel 5

1. And you, son of man, take a sharp knife, a barbers razor, take it to yourself and pass it over your head and your beard; then take scales to weigh and divide the hair.

2. You shall burn with fire one-third in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are finished; then you shall take one-third and strike around it with the sword, and one-third you shall scatter into the wind: and I will draw out a sword after them.

3. You shall also take a small number of them and bind them in the edge of your garment.

4. Then take some of them again and throw them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire. From there a fire will go out into all the house of Israel.

5. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the midst of the nations and the lands all around her.

6. And she has rebelled against My judgments by doing wickedness more than the nations, and against My statutes more than the lands that are all around her; for they have rejected My judgments, and they have not walked in My statutes.

7. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have multiplied disobedience more than the nations that are all around you, have not walked in My statutes nor kept My judgments, nor even done according to the judgments of the nations that are all around you;

8. therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold I, even I, am against you and will execute judgments in your midst in the eyes of the nations.

9. And I will do in you what I have never done, and the likes of which I will never do again, because of all your abominations.

10. Therefore fathers shall eat their sons in your midst, and sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in you, and all of you who remain I will scatter to all the winds.

11. Therefore, as I live, says the Lord Jehovah, surely, because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable idols and with all your abominations, therefore I will also diminish you; My eye will not spare, nor will I have any pity.

12. A third of you shall die of the pestilence, and be consumed with famine in your midst; and a third shall fall by the sword all around you; and I will scatter the other third to all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.

13. Thus shall My anger be spent, and I will cause My fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted; and they shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken in My zeal, when I have spent My fury upon them.

14. Moreover I will make you a waste and a reproach among the nations that are all around you, in the eyes of all who pass by.

15. So it shall be a reproach, a taunt, a chastening, and a horror to the nations that are all around you, when I execute judgments against you in anger and in fury and in furious punishment. I, Jehovah, have spoken.

16. When I send against them the terrible arrows of famine which shall be for destruction, which I will send to destroy you, I will increase the famine upon you and cut off your food supply.

17. Thus I will send against you famine and evil beasts, and they will bereave you. Pestilence and blood shall pass through you, and I will bring the sword against you. I, Jehovah, have spoken.

## Ezekiel 6

1. And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying:

2. Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,

3. and say, O mountains of Israel, hear the Word of the Lord Jehovah! Thus says the Lord Jehovah to the mountains, to the hills, to the ravines, and to the valleys: Behold I, even I, will bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places.

4. And your altars shall be desolate, your incense altars shall be broken, and I will cast down your slain before your idols.

5. And I will lay the corpses of the children of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones all around your altars.

6. In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate, so that your altars may be laid waste and found guilty, your idols broken and brought to an end, your incense altars cut down, and your works blotted out.

7. And the slain shall fall in your midst, and you shall know that I am Jehovah.

8. Yet I will leave a remnant, so that you may have some who escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered throughout the earth.

9. And those of you who escape will remember Me among the nations where they are carried captive, because I was crushed by their adulterous heart which has turned away from Me, and by their eyes which go whoring after their idols; they will loathe themselves for the evils which they did in all their abominations.

10. And they shall know that I am Jehovah; I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.

11. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Strike with your hands and stamp with your feet, and say, Alas, for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! For they shall fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.

12. He who is far off shall die by the pestilence, he who is near shall fall by the sword, and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine. Thus will I spend My fury upon them.

13. Then you shall know that I am Jehovah, when their slain are among their idols all around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree, and under every thick oak, wherever they offered soothing aromas to all their idols.

14. Thus I will stretch out My hand against them and make the land desolate, yes, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblah, in all their dwelling places. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 7

1. Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

2. And you, son of man, thus says the Lord Jehovah to the land of Israel: An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land.

3. Now the end has come upon you, and I will send My anger against you; I will judge you according to your ways, and I will repay you for all your abominations.

4. My eye will not spare you, nor will I have pity; but I will repay your ways, and your abominations will be in your midst; then you shall know that I am Jehovah!

5. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: An evil! An only evil! Behold, it has come!

6. An end has come, the end has come; it has awakened against you; behold, it has come!

7. Morning has come to you, you who dwell in the land; the time has come, a day of trouble is near, and not a shout of rejoicing in the mountains.

8. Now upon you I will soon pour out My fury, and spend My anger upon you; I will judge you according to your ways, and I will repay you for all your abominations.

9. My eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; I will repay you according to your ways, and your abominations that are in your midst. And you shall know that I am Jehovah who strikes.

10. Behold, the day! Behold, it has come! Morning has gone forth; the staff has blossomed, pride has budded.

11. Violence has risen up into a staff of wickedness; none of them shall remain, none of their multitude, none of their abundance, nor any eminent among them.

12. The time has come, the day draws near. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all their multitude.

13. For the seller shall not return to what has been sold, though he may still be alive (for the vision concerns the whole multitude, and shall not change); no one will strengthen himself who lives in iniquity.

14. They have blown the trumpet and made everyone ready, but no one goes to battle; for My wrath is on all their multitude.

15. The sword is outside, and the pestilence and famine within. Whoever is in the field will die by the sword; and whoever is in the city, famine and pestilence will devour him.

16. Those who survive will escape and be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, each for his iniquity.

17. Every hand will be feeble, and every knee will be as weak as water.

18. They will also be girded with sackcloth; trembling will cover them; shame will be on every face, and baldness on all their heads.

19. They will throw their silver into the streets, and their gold will be like filthiness; their silver and their gold will not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah; they will not satisfy their souls, nor fill their stomachs, because it is the stumbling block of their iniquity.

20. As for the beauty of His ornaments, He set it in majesty; but they made from it the images of their abominations; their detestable things; therefore I have made it like refuse to them.

21. And I will give it as plunder into the hands of strangers, and to the wicked of the earth as spoils; and they shall defile it.

22. I will turn My face from them, and they will defile My secret place; for violent ones shall enter it and defile it.

23. Make a chain, for the land is filled with bloody judgments, and the city is full of violence.

24. Therefore I will bring the most evil of the nations, and they will possess their houses; I will bring an end to the pomp of the strong, and their holy places shall be defiled.

25. Destruction comes! They will seek peace, but there shall be none.

26. Disaster will come upon disaster, and rumor will be upon rumor. Then they will seek a vision from a prophet; but the Law will perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.

27. The king will mourn, the prince will be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land will be terrified. I will do to them according to their way, and according to their judgment I will punish them. And they shall know that I am Jehovah!

## Ezekiel 8

1. And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, with the elders of Judah sitting before me, that the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell upon me there.

2. Then I looked, and there was a likeness, like the appearance of fire; from the appearance of His waist and downward, fire; and from His waist and upward, like the appearance of brightness, like the color of amber.

3. And He stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and the heavens, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the north gate of the inner court, where the seat of the image of jealousy was, which provokes to jealousy.

4. And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the plain.

5. Then He said to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, toward the north at the gate of the altar, was this image of jealousy at the entrance.

6. Furthermore He said to me, Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here, to make Me go far away from My sanctuary? Now turn again, you will see greater abominations.

7. So He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.

8. Then He said to me, Son of man, dig into the wall; and when I dug into the wall, there was an opening.

9. And He said to me, Go in, and see the evil abominations which they do there.

10. So I went in and saw; and behold, every sort of creeping thing, abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, carved all around on the wall.

11. And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and in their midst stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan. Each man had a censer in his hand, and a thick cloud of incense went up.

12. Then He said to me, Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the room of his idols? For they say, Jehovah does not see us, Jehovah has forsaken the land.

13. And He said to me, Turn again, and you will see greater abominations that they are doing.

14. So He brought me to the door of the north gate of the house of Jehovah; and behold, women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz.

15. Then He said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? Turn again, you will see greater abominations than these.

16. So He brought me into the inner court of the house of Jehovah; and behold, at the door of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah and their faces toward the east, and they were bowing down to the sun toward the east.

17. And He said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it a trivial thing to the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence; then they have returned to provoke Me to anger. Indeed they put the branch to their nose.

18. Therefore I also will act in fury. My eye will not spare nor will I have pity; and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.

## Ezekiel 9

1. Then He called out in my hearing with a loud voice, saying, Let those who have charge over the city draw near, each with his destroying weapon in his hand.

2. And, behold, six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with his shattering weapon in his hand. One man among them was clothed with linen and had a writers inkhorn at his side. And they went in and stood beside the bronze altar.

3. And the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub, where it had been, to the threshold of the house. And He called to the man clothed with linen, who had the writers inkhorn at his side;

4. and Jehovah said to him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and cry over all the abominations that are done within it.

5. To the others He said in my hearing, Go after him through the city and kill; do not let your eye spare, nor have pity.

6. Utterly slay old and young men, maidens and little children and women; but do not come near anyone on whom is the mark; and begin at My sanctuary. So they began with the elders who were before the house.

7. Then He said to them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go forth! And they went out and killed in the city.

8. So it was, that while they were killing them, I was left alone; and I fell on my face and cried out, and said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! Will You destroy all the remnant of Israel in pouring out Your fury on Jerusalem?

9. Then He said to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is filled with blood, and the city is full of perversity; for they say, Jehovah has forsaken the land; and, Jehovah does not see!

10. And as for Me also, My eye will neither spare, nor will I have pity, but I will recompense their deeds upon their own head.

11. And behold, the man clothed with linen, who had the inkhorn at his side, reported back and said, I have done as You commanded me.

## Ezekiel 10

1. And I looked, and there in the expanse that was above the head of the cherubim, there appeared something like a sapphire stone, having the appearance of the likeness of a throne.

2. Then He spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in among the wheels, under the cherub, fill your hands with coals of fire from among the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in before my eyes.

3. Now the cherubim were standing on the right side of the house when the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court.

4. Then the glory of Jehovah went up from the cherub, and paused over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the glory of Jehovah.

5. And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even in the outer court, like the voice of Almighty God when He speaks.

6. And it happened, when He had commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from among the wheels, from among the cherubim, that he went in and stood beside the wheels.

7. And the cherub stretched out his hand from among the cherubim to the fire that was among the cherubim, and took some of it and put it into the hands of the man clothed with linen, who took it and went out.

8. And under the cherubims wings appeared the form of a mans hand.

9. And when I looked, behold, four wheels were beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub and another wheel beside each other cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was as the color of a beryl stone.

10. As for their appearance, all four had one likeness; as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel.

11. When they went, they went toward any of their four directions; they did not turn aside when they went, but followed in the direction the head was facing. They did not turn aside as they went.

12. And their whole body, with their back, their hands, their wings, and the wheels that the four had, were full of eyes all around.

13. As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, Rolling Wheel.

14. And each one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, the second face the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.

15. And the cherubim were lifted up. This was the living creature that I saw by the River Chebar.

16. And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels themselves did not turn from beside them.

17. When they stood still, these stood still; and when they rose up, these rose up; for the spirit of the living creature was in them.

18. Then the glory of Jehovah departed from the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubim.

19. And the cherubim lifted their wings and mounted up from the earth before my eyes. When they went out, the wheels were beside them; and they stood at the door of the east gate of the house of Jehovah, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them from above.

20. This is the living creature I saw under the God of Israel by the River Chebar, and I knew that they were cherubim.

21. Each one had four faces and each one four wings, and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.

22. And the likeness of their faces was the same as the faces which I had seen by the River Chebar, their appearance, even theirs. They each went straight forward.

## Ezekiel 11

1. Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the East Gate of the house of Jehovah, which faces eastward; and there at the door of the gate were twenty-five men, among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, rulers of the people.

2. And He said to me: Son of man, these are the men who devise wickedness and give evil advice in this city,

3. who say, The time is not near; let us build houses. This city is the kettle, and we are the flesh.

4. Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man!

5. And the Spirit of Jehovah fell upon me, and said to me, Speak! Thus says Jehovah: Thus you have said, O house of Israel; for I know the thoughts that come into your mind.

6. You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets with the slain.

7. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Your slain whom you have laid in its midst, they are the flesh, and this city is the kettle; but I shall bring you out of the midst of it.

8. You have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, says the Lord Jehovah.

9. And I will bring you out of its midst, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and execute judgments against you.

10. You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you to the borders of Israel. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.

11. This city shall not be your kettle, nor shall you be the flesh in its midst. I will judge you in the borders of Israel.

12. And you shall know that I am Jehovah; for you have not walked in My statutes nor executed My judgments, but have done according to the customs of the nations which are all around you.

13. And it happened, while I was prophesying, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell on my face and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! Will You make a complete end of the remnant of Israel?

14. Again the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

15. Son of man, your brethren, your relatives, the men of your kindred, and all the house of Israel, all of them, are those to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Go far away from Jehovah; this land has been given to us as a possession.

16. Therefore say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Although I have cast them far off among the nations, and although I have scattered them throughout the earth, yet I shall be a little sanctuary for them in the lands where they have gone.

17. Therefore say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will gather you from the peoples, assemble you from the lands where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.

18. And they will come there, and they will take away all its detestable things and all its abominations from there.

19. And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you, and take the stony heart out of their flesh, and give them a heart of flesh,

20. that they may walk in My statutes and keep My judgments and do them; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God.

21. But as for those whose hearts follow the desire for their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their deeds upon their own heads, says the Lord Jehovah.

22. Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them from above.

23. And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city and stood on the mountain, which is on the east side of the city.

24. Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to those of the captivity. And the vision that I had seen went up from me.

25. So I spoke to those of the captivity all the things that Jehovah had shown me.

## Ezekiel 12

1. And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying:

2. Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see but do not see, and ears to hear but do not hear; for they are a rebellious house.

3. Therefore, son of man, prepare your belongings for exile, and go into exile by day in their sight. You shall go from your place into exile to another place in their sight. It may be that they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.

4. By day you shall bring out your belongings in their sight, as though going into captivity; and at evening you shall go in their sight, like those who go into captivity.

5. Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry your belongings out through it.

6. In their sight you shall bear them on your shoulders and carry them out at twilight; you shall cover your face, so that you cannot see the ground, for I have made you a sign to the house of Israel.

7. So I did as I was commanded. I brought out my belongings by day, as though going into captivity, and at evening I dug through the wall with my hand. I brought them out at twilight, and I bore them on my shoulder in their sight.

8. And in the morning the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

9. Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, What are you doing?

10. Say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are among them.

11. Say, I am a sign to you. As I have done, so shall it be done to them; they shall go into exile, into captivity.

12. And the prince who is among them shall bear his belongings on his shoulder in the dark and go out. They shall dig through the wall to carry them out through it. He shall cover his face, so that he cannot see the ground with his eyes.

13. I will also spread My net over him, and he shall be caught in My snare. I will bring him to Babylon, to the land of the Chaldeans; yet he shall not see it, though he shall die there.

14. And I will scatter to every wind all who are around him to help him, and all his troops; and I will draw out the sword after them.

15. And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the earth.

16. But I will leave of them a number of men from the sword, from famine, and from pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the nations wherever they go. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.

17. Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

18. Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling and anxiety.

19. And say to the people of the land, Thus says the Lord Jehovah to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with anxiety, and drink their water with horror, so that her land may be emptied of all who are in it, because of the violence of all those who dwell in it.

20. Then the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall become desolate; and you shall know that I am Jehovah.

21. And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

22. Son of man, what is this proverb that you people have about the land of Israel, which says, The days are prolonged, and every vision fails?

23. Tell them therefore, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will put an end to this proverb, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel. But say to them, The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision.

24. For no more shall there be any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.

25. For I, Jehovah, speak, and the Word which I speak will come to pass; it will no more be drawn out. For in your days, O rebellious house, I will say the word and perform it, declares the Lord Jehovah.

26. Again the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

27. Son of man, behold, the house of Israel is saying, The vision that he sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of times afar off.

28. Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: None of My words will be drawn out any more, but the word which I speak will be done, declares the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 13

1. And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy out of their own heart, Hear the Word of Jehovah!

3. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing!

4. O Israel, your prophets are like foxes in the deserts.

5. You have not gone up into the gaps, nor built a wall for the house of Israel to stand in battle in the day of Jehovah.

6. They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, Jehovah declares! But Jehovah has not sent them; yet they hope that their word may be confirmed.

7. Have you not seen a vain vision, and have you not spoken a lying divination? You say, Jehovah declares; though I have not spoken.

8. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have spoken vanity and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, declares the Lord Jehovah.

9. And My hand will be against the prophets who see vanity and who divine lies; they shall not be in the council of My people, nor be written in the record of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter into the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.

10. Because, indeed, because they have seduced My people, saying, Peace! when there is no peace; and one builds a wall, and plasters it with whitewash.

11. Say to those who plaster it with whitewash, that it will fall. There will be a flooding rain, and you, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall break it down.

12. Surely, when the wall has fallen, will it not be said to you, Where is the mortar with which you plastered it?

13. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will cause a stormy wind to break forth in My fury; and there shall be a flooding rain in My anger, and great hailstones in fury to consume it.

14. Thus I will break down the wall you have plastered with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be uncovered; it will fall, and you shall be consumed in the midst of it. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.

15. Thus will I accomplish My wrath on the wall and on those who have plastered it with whitewash; and I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who plastered it;

16. that is, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her when there is no peace, declares the Lord Jehovah.

17. Likewise, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own heart; prophesy against them,

18. and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the women who sew amulets on their sleeves and make veils for the heads of people of every height, to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of My people, and save the souls alive to yourselves?

19. And will you profane Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, executing souls that should not die, and keeping alive the souls that should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies?

20. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against your amulets by which you hunt souls to make them fly. I will tear them from your arms, and let the souls go, the souls you hunt to make them fly.

21. I will also tear off your veils and deliver My people out of your hand, and they shall no longer be as prey in your hand. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.

22. Because with lies you have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not pained; and you have strengthened the hands of the wicked, so that he does not turn from his wicked way to restore his life.

23. Therefore you shall no longer see vanity nor divine divinations; for I will deliver My people out of your hand, and you shall know that I am Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 14

1. Then some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me.

2. And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

3. Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts, and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces. Should I be inquired of at all by them?

4. Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Everyone of the house of Israel who sets up his idols in his heart, and puts before his face the stumbling block of his iniquity, and then comes to the prophet, I, Jehovah will answer him who comes, according to the multitude of his idols,

5. that I may catch the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from Me through their idols.

6. Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Repent, turn away from your idols, and turn your faces away from all your abominations.

7. For anyone of the house of Israel, or of the stranger who sojourns in Israel, who separates himself from Me and sets up his idols in his heart and puts before his face the stumbling block of his iniquity, and comes to a prophet to inquire of him concerning Me, I Jehovah will answer him by Myself.

8. I will set My face against that man and make him desolate as a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of My people. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.

9. And if the prophet is induced to speak anything, I Jehovah have induced that prophet, and I will stretch out My hand against him and destroy him from the midst of My people Israel.

10. And they shall bear their iniquity; the punishment of the prophet shall be the same as the punishment of the one who inquired,

11. that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me, nor be defiled anymore with all their transgressions, but that they may be My people and I may be their God, says the Lord Jehovah.

12. The Word of Jehovah came again to me, saying:

13. Son of man, when a land sins against Me by acting treacherously unfaithfully, I will stretch out My hand against it; I will cut off its supply of food, send famine on it, and cut off man and beast from it.

14. And although these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver only themselves by their righteousness, declares the Lord Jehovah.

15. If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they bereave it, and make it so desolate that no man may pass through because of the beasts,

16. although these three men were in it, as I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters; only they would be delivered, and the land would be desolate.

17. Or if I bring a sword on that land, and say, Sword, go through the land, and I cut off man and beast from it,

18. although these three men were in it, as I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but only they themselves would be delivered.

19. Or if I send a pestilence into that land and pour out My fury on it in blood, and cut off from it man and beast,

20. although Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, they would deliver neither son nor daughter; they would deliver only themselves by their righteousness.

21. For thus says the Lord Jehovah: How much more shall it be when I send My four severe judgments on Jerusalem; the sword and famine and wild beasts and pestilence; to cut off man and beast from it!

22. Yet behold, there shall be left in it a remnant who will be brought out, both sons and daughters; surely they will come out to you, and you will see their ways and their doings. Then you will be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, all that I have brought upon it.

23. And they will comfort you when you see their ways and their doings; and you shall know that I have done nothing without cause, all that I have done in it, says the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 15

1. And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying:

2. Son of man, how is the wood of the vine, the vine branch, better than any other wood which is among the trees of the forest?

3. Is wood taken from it to make any object? Or can men make a peg from it on which to hang any vessel?

4. Instead, it is thrown into the fire for fuel; the fire devours both ends of it, and its middle is burned. Is it useful for any work?

5. Indeed, when it was whole, no object could be made from it. How much less will it be useful for any work when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned.

6. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem;

7. and I will set My face against them. They will go out from one fire, but another fire shall devour them. And you shall know that I am Jehovah, when I set My face against them.

8. And I will make the land desolate, because they have acted treacherously unfaithfully, says the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 16

1. Again the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,

3. and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah to Jerusalem: Your origin and your birth are from the land of Canaan; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.

4. As for your birth, on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut, nor were you washed in water to cleanse you; you were not rubbed with salt nor wrapped in swaddling cloths.

5. No eye pitied you, to do any of these things for you, to have compassion on you; but you were thrown out into the open field, for you yourself were loathed on the day you were born.

6. And when I passed by you and saw you squirming in your blood, I said to you in your blood, Live! Yes, I said to you in your blood, Live!

7. I have made you a multitude, like a plant in the field; and you grew, became great, bedecked with ornaments. Your breasts were formed, your hair grew, but you were naked and bare.

8. When I passed by you again and looked upon you, indeed your time was the time of love; so I spread the edge of My garment over you and covered your nakedness. Yes, I swore an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you, and you became Mine, declares the Lord Jehovah.

9. Then I washed you in water; yes, I thoroughly washed away your blood, and I anointed you with oil.

10. I clothed you in embroidered cloth and gave you sandals of badger skin; I clothed you with fine linen and covered you with silk.

11. I adorned you with ornaments, put bracelets on your wrists, and a chain on your neck.

12. And I put a ring in your nose, earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown upon your head.

13. Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. You ate of fine flour, honey, and oil. You were exceedingly beautiful, and succeeded to royalty.

14. Your fame went out among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through My splendor which I had bestowed upon you, declares the Lord Jehovah.

15. But you trusted in your own beauty, committed adultery because of your fame, and poured out your harlotry on everyone passing by who would have it.

16. You took some of your garments and adorned multicolored high places for yourself, and committed adultery on them. Such things should not happen, nor be.

17. You have also taken your beautiful jewelry from My gold and My silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself male images and committed adultery with them.

18. And you took your embroidered garments and covered them, and you set My oil and My incense before them.

19. Also My food which I gave you; the fine flour, oil, and honey which I fed you; you set it before them as a soothing aroma; and so it was, says the Lord Jehovah.

20. Moreover you took your sons and your daughters, whom you bore to Me, and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Were your acts of harlotry a small matter,

21. that you have slain My children and offered them up to them by causing them to pass through the fire?

22. And in all your abominations and acts of harlotry you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, squirming in your blood.

23. And so it was, after all your wickedness (Woe, woe unto you! declares the Lord Jehovah);

24. that you also built for yourself a mound, and made a high place for yourself in every open place.

25. You built your high places at the head of every road, and made your beauty to be abhorred. You offered yourself to everyone who passed by, and multiplied your acts of harlotry.

26. You also committed adultery with the Egyptians, your very fleshly neighbors, and increased your acts of harlotry to provoke Me to anger.

27. Behold, therefore, I stretched out My hand against you, diminished your allotment, and gave you up to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your licentious ways.

28. You also committed adultery with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; indeed you committed adultery with them and still were not satisfied.

29. Moreover you multiplied your acts of harlotry in the land of Canaan, as far as Chaldea; and even then you were not satisfied.

30. How weak is your heart! declares the Lord Jehovah, seeing you do all these things; the deeds of a domineering woman of prostitution.

31. You build your mound at the head of every road, and built your high place in every open place. Yet you were not like a prostitute, in that you scorned payment.

32. You are an adulterous wife, who takes strangers instead of her husband.

33. Men give gifts to all prostitutes, but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and bribe them to come to you from all around for your harlotry.

34. You are the opposite of other women in your harlotry, because no one solicited you to be a prostitute. In that you gave payment but no payment was given you, therefore you are the opposite.

35. Now then, O prostitute! Hear the Word of Jehovah!

36. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because your filthiness was poured out and your nakedness uncovered in your harlotry with your lovers, and with all your abominable idols, and because of the blood of your children which you gave to them,

37. surely, therefore, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved, and all those you hated; I will gather them from all around against you and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness.

38. And I will judge you as women who commit adultery or who shed blood are judged; I will bring blood upon you in fury and jealousy.

39. I will also give you into their hand, and they shall throw down your mounds and break down your high places. They shall also strip you of your clothes, take your beautiful jewelry, and leave you naked and bare.

40. They shall also bring up a company against you, and they shall stone you with stones and cut you with their swords.

41. And they shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women; and I will put an end to your harlotry, and you shall no longer hire lovers.

42. So I will lay to rest My fury toward you, and My jealousy shall depart from you. I will be quiet, and be angry no more.

43. Because you did not remember the days of your youth, but agitated Me with all these things, surely I will also recompense your deeds upon your own head, says the Lord Jehovah. And you shall not commit licentiousness in addition to all your abominations.

44. Indeed everyone who quotes proverbs will use this proverb against you: Like mother, like daughter!

45. You are your mothers daughter, loathing her husband and children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.

46. And your older sister is Samaria, who dwells with her daughters to the north of you; and your younger sister, who dwells to the south of you, is Sodom and her daughters.

47. Yet you did not walk in their ways nor act according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you became more corrupt than they in all your ways.

48. As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, neither your sister Sodom nor her daughters have done as you and your daughters have done.

49. Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: She and her daughter had pride, fullness of food, and abundance of idleness; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.

50. And they were haughty and committed abomination before Me; therefore I took them away as I saw fit.

51. Samaria did not commit half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters by all the abominations which you have done.

52. You who judged your sisters, bear your own shame also, because your sins were more abominable than theirs; they are more righteous than you. Yes, be disgraced also, and bear your own shame, because you justified your sisters.

53. When I bring back their captives, the captives of Sodom and her daughters, and the captives of Samaria and her daughters, then I will also bring back the captives of your captivity among them,

54. so that you may bear your own shame and be disgraced by all that you did, since you comforted them.

55. When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters return to their former state, then you and your daughters will return to your former state.

56. For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride,

57. before your wickedness was uncovered. It was like the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria and all those around her, and of the daughters of the Philistines, who despise you from all around.

58. You have paid for your licentiousness and your abominations, declares Jehovah.

59. For thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will deal with you as you have done, who have despised the oath by breaking the covenant.

60. Nevertheless I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you.

61. Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed, when you receive your older and your younger sisters; and I will give them to you for daughters, but not by your covenant.

62. And I will establish My covenant with you. And you shall know that I am Jehovah,

63. so that you may remember and be ashamed. And you will never open your mouth anymore because of your shame, when I provide atonement for you for all that you have done, declares the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 17

1. And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, propound a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel,

3. and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: A great eagle with large wings and long pinions, full of feathers of various colors, came to Lebanon and took the highest branch from the cedar.

4. He cropped off its topmost young twig and carried it to a land of trade; he set it in a city of merchants.

5. Then he took some of the seed of the land and planted it in a fertile field; he placed it by abundant waters and set it like a willow tree.

6. And it grew and became a spreading vine of low stature; its branches turned toward him, and its roots were under him. So it became a vine, brought forth branches, and put forth shoots.

7. There was another great eagle with large wings and many feathers; and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, and stretched its branches toward him, away from the garden terrace where it had been planted, that he might water it.

8. It was planted in good soil by many waters, to bring forth branches, bear fruit, and become a majestic vine.

9. Say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots, cut off its fruit, and leave it to wither? All of its sprouting leaves will wither, and no great power or many people will be needed to pluck it up by its roots.

10. Behold, being planted, will it prosper? Will it not utterly wither when the east wind touches it? It shall wither in the garden terrace where it sprouted.

11. Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

12. Say now to the rebellious house: Do you not know what these things mean? Tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon has come to Jerusalem and has taken its king and rulers, and led them with him to Babylon.

13. And he has taken the kings seed, made a covenant with him, and put him under oath. He also has taken away the mighty of the land,

14. that the kingdom might be low, that it might not lift itself up, but that by the keeping of his covenant it might stand.

15. But he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt, that they might give him horses and many people. Will he prosper? Will he who does such things escape? Can he break a covenant and still be delivered?

16. As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke, there he shall die with him in the midst of Babylon.

17. Nor will Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company do anything in the war, when they heap up a siege mound and build a wall to cut off many persons.

18. Since he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, and in fact gave his hand and still did all these things, he shall not escape.

19. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely My oath which he despised, and My covenant which he broke, I will recompense upon his own head.

20. And I will spread My net over him, and he shall be taken in My snare. I will bring him to Babylon and judge him there for the treason by which he betrayed Me.

21. And all his fugitives with all his troops shall fall by the sword, and those who remain shall be scattered to every wind. And you shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken.

22. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will take also one of the highest branches of the high cedar and set it out. I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and will plant it on a high and lofty mountain.

23. On the mountain height of Israel I will plant it; and it will bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a majestic cedar. And under it will dwell birds of every wing; in the shadow of its branches they will dwell.

24. And all the trees of the field shall know that I, Jehovah, have brought down the high tree and exalted the low tree, dried up the green tree and made the dry tree flourish; I, Jehovah, have spoken and have done it.

## Ezekiel 18

1. The Word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying,

2. What do you mean when you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying: The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the childrens teeth are dull?

3. As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, you shall no longer use this proverb in Israel.

4. Behold, all souls are Mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is Mine; the soul who sins shall die.

5. But if a man is righteous and does what is just and right;

6. if he has not eaten on the mountains, nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, nor defiled his neighbors wife, nor approached a menstruating woman;

7. if he has not oppressed anyone, but has restored to the debtor his pledge; has plundered no one by robbery, but has given his bread to the hungry and covered the naked with clothing;

8. if he has not given with usury nor taken any increase, but has withdrawn his hand from iniquity and executed true judgment between man and man;

9. if he has walked in My statutes and kept My judgments faithfully; he is righteous. He shall live life, says the Lord Jehovah.

10. If he begets a son who is a robber or who sheds blood, who does any of these things,

11. and does none of those duties, but has eaten on the mountains or defiled his neighbors wife;

12. if he has oppressed the poor and needy, plundered by robbery, not restored the pledge, has lifted his eyes to the idols, or committed abomination;

13. if he has exacted usury or taken increase; shall he then live? He shall not live! If he has done any of these abominations, he shall die the death; his blood shall be upon him.

14. If, however, he begets a son who sees all the sins which his father has done, and considers but does not do likewise;

15. who has not eaten on the mountains, nor lifted his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, nor defiled his neighbors wife;

16. has not oppressed anyone, nor withheld a pledge, nor plundered by robbery, but has given his bread to the hungry and covered the naked with clothing;

17. who has withdrawn his hand from the poor and not received usury or increase, but has executed My judgments and walked in My statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father; he shall live life!

18. As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, plundered his brother by robbery, and did what is not good among his people, behold, he shall die in his iniquity.

19. Yet you say, Why? Does not the son bear the guilt of the father? When the son has done what is lawful and right, and has kept all My statutes and done them, he shall live life.

20. The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not bear the guilt of the father, nor the father bear the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself.

21. But if a wicked man turns from all his sins which he has done, keeps all My statutes, and does what is lawful and right, he shall live life; he shall not die.

22. None of the transgressions which he has done shall be remembered against him; because of the righteousness which he has done, he shall live.

23. Do I delight with pleasure in the death of the wicked? says the Lord Jehovah, and not that he should turn back from his ways and live?

24. But when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live? All the righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; because of the treachery of his unfaithfulness, and the sin which he has sinned, in them he shall die.

25. Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not fair. Hear now, O house of Israel, is it not My way which is fair, and your ways which are not fair.

26. When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, commits iniquity, and dies in it, it is for the iniquity which he has done that he dies.

27. Again, when a wicked man turns away from the wickedness which he has done, and does what is lawful and right, he preserves himself alive.

28. Because he considers and turns away from all the transgressions which he has done, he shall live life; he shall not die.

29. Yet the house of Israel says, The way of the Lord is not fair. O house of Israel, is it not My ways which are fair, and your ways which are not fair.

30. Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, says the Lord Jehovah. Repent, and turn from all your transgressions, so that iniquity shall not be a stumbling block to you.

31. Cast away from you all the transgressions by which you have transgressed, and prepare for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit; for why will you die, O house of Israel?

32. For I have no pleasure in the death of one who dies, declares the Lord Jehovah. Therefore turn and live!

## Ezekiel 19

1. Moreover take up a lamentation for the rulers of Israel,

2. and say: What is your mother? A lioness: she lay down among the lions; among the young lions she nourished her cubs.

3. She brought up one of her cubs, and he became a young lion; he learned to catch prey, and he devoured men.

4. The nations also heard of him; he was trapped in their pit, and they brought him with chains to the land of Egypt.

5. When she saw that she waited, that her hope was lost, she took another of her cubs and made him a young lion.

6. He went around among the lions, and became a young lion; he learned to catch prey; he devoured men.

7. He knew their desolate places, and laid waste their cities; the land with its fullness was desolated by the sound of his roaring.

8. Then the nations set against him from the provinces on every side, and spread their net over him; he was caught in their pit.

9. They put him in a cage with chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him in hunting nets, so that his voice should no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel.

10. Your mother was like a vine in your blood, planted by the waters, fruitful and full of branches because of many waters.

11. She had strong branches for the scepters of rulers. She towered in stature above the thick branches, and was seen in her height amid the abundance of her branches.

12. But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit. Her strong branches were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.

13. And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.

14. Fire has gone out from a staff of her branches and devoured her fruit, so that she has no strong staff; a scepter for ruling. This is a lamentation, and has become a lamentation.

## Ezekiel 20

1. It came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, that certain men of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Jehovah, and sat before me.

2. Then the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

3. Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Have you come to inquire of Me? As I live, says the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.

4. Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Then cause them to know the abominations of their fathers.

5. And say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: On the day when I chose Israel and raised My hand and swore to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt, I raised My hand and swore to them, saying, I am Jehovah your God.

6. On that day I raised My hand and swore to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all the earth.

7. Then I said to them, Each of you, throw away the abominations which are before his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am Jehovah your God.

8. But they rebelled against Me and would not obey Me. They did not, each man, cast away the abominations which were before their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said, I will pour out My fury upon them and fulfill My anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.

9. But I acted for My names sake, that it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations among whom they were, in whose sight I had made Myself known to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt.

10. Therefore I made them go out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.

11. And I gave them My statutes and showed them My judgments, which, if a man does, he shall even live by them.

12. Moreover I also gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am Jehovah who sets them apart.

13. But the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness; they did not walk in My statutes; they despised My judgments, which, if a man does, he shall even live by them; and they greatly defiled My Sabbaths. Then I said, I will pour out My fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.

14. But I acted for My names sake, that it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.

15. So I also raised My hand and swore to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all the earth,

16. because they despised My judgments and did not walk in My statutes, but profaned My Sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols.

17. Nevertheless My eye spared them from destruction. I did not make an end of them in the wilderness.

18. But I said to their children in the wilderness, Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, nor keep their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols.

19. I am Jehovah your God. Walk in My statutes, keep My judgments, and do them;

20. set apart My Sabbaths, and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that you may know that I am Jehovah your God.

21. Nevertheless, the children rebelled against Me; they did not walk in My statutes, and did not keep My judgments, which, if a man does, he shall even live by them; but they profaned My Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out My fury on them and fulfill My anger against them in the wilderness.

22. Nevertheless I withdrew My hand and acted for My names sake, that it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.

23. And I raised My hand and swore to those in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the earth,

24. because they had not executed My judgments, but had despised My statutes, profaned My Sabbaths, and their eyes followed after their fathers idols.

25. Therefore I also gave them up to statutes that were not good, and judgments by which they could not live;

26. and I defiled them by their gifts, in that they caused all that open the womb to pass through the fire, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Jehovah.

27. Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed Me, by being treacherously unfaithful to Me.

28. For when I brought them into the land concerning which I had raised My hand and sworn to give it to them, and they saw all the high hills and all the thick trees, there they offered their sacrifices and provoked Me with their offerings. There they also sent up their soothing aroma and poured out their drink offerings.

29. Then I said to them, What is this high place to which you go? And its name is called Bamah to this day.

30. Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Are you defiling yourselves in the manner of your fathers, and committing adultery with their abominations?

31. For when you offer your gifts and make your sons pass through the fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols, even to this day. So shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.

32. What you have in your mind shall never be, when you say, We will be like the nations, like the families in other lands, serving wood and stone.

33. As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, surely with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, I will rule over you.

34. And I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the lands where you are scattered, with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out.

35. And I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will plead with you face to face.

36. Just as I judged your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will judge you, declares the Lord Jehovah.

37. I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant;

38. I will purge out the rebels from among you, and those who transgress against Me. I will bring them out of the land where they dwell, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel. And you will know that I am Jehovah.

39. As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord Jehovah: Go, serve every one of you his idols, even hereafter, if you will not obey me. But profane My holy name no more with your gifts and your idols.

40. For on My holy mountain, on the mountain height of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah, there all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, shall serve Me; there I will accept them, and there I will require your offerings and the firstfruits of your sacrifices, together with all your holy things.

41. I will accept you as a soothing aroma when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the lands where you have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the nations.

42. And you shall know that I am Jehovah, when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the land for which I raised My hand and swore to give it to your fathers.

43. And there you shall remember your ways and all your evil deeds with which you were defiled; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight because of all the evils that you have done.

44. And you shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have dealt with you for My names sake, not according to your wicked ways nor according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel, declares the Lord Jehovah.

45. Furthermore the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

46. Son of man, set your face toward the south; drop a word toward the south and prophesy against the forest land, the South,

47. and say to the forest of the South, Hear the Word of Jehovah! Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree and every dry tree in you; the blazing flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be scorched by it.

48. All flesh shall see that I, Jehovah, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.

49. Then I said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! They say of me, Does he not speak parables?

## Ezekiel 21

1. And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, drop a word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel;

3. and say to the land of Israel, Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I am against you, and I will draw My sword out of its sheath and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked.

4. Because I will cut off both the righteous and the wicked from you, therefore My sword shall go out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north,

5. that all flesh may know that I, Jehovah, have drawn My sword out of its sheath; it shall not return anymore.

6. Sigh therefore, son of man, with a breaking heart, and groan with bitterness before their eyes.

7. And it shall be when they say to you, Why are you sighing? that you shall answer, Because of the news; when it comes, every heart will melt, all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak as water. Behold, it is coming and shall be brought to pass, declares the Lord Jehovah.

8. Again the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

9. Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says Jehovah! Say: A sword, a sword is sharpened and also polished!

10. It is sharpened to slaughter and butcher, polished to flash like lightning! Should we then make mirth? It despises the scepter of My son, as every tree.

11. And He has given it to be polished, that it may be handled; this sword is sharpened, and it is polished to be given into the hand of the slayer.

12. Cry and howl, son of man; for it will be against My people, against all the rulers of Israel. The sword will be thrown against My people; therefore slap your thigh,

13. because it is a testing. And what if the sword despises even the scepter? It shall be no more, declares the Lord Jehovah.

14. You therefore, son of man, prophesy, and strike hand to hand; strike. The third time let the sword be doubled. It is the sword that slays, the sword that slays the great men, that surrounds them.

15. I have set the slaughter of the sword against all their gates, That the heart may melt and many may stumble. Ah! It is made bright; it is grasped for the slaughter:

16. Be sharp to the right! Set yourself to the left; wherever your face is appointed!

17. I also will strike My hand to hand, and I will cause My fury to rest; I, Jehovah, have spoken.

18. The Word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying:

19. And you, son of man, appoint for yourself two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come; both of them shall come forth from the same land. Make a sign; put it at the head of the road to the city.

20. Appoint a road for the sword to go into Rabbah of the Ammonites, and to Judah, into fortified Jerusalem.

21. For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the road, at the head of the two roads, to use divination: he shakes the arrows, he consults the images, he looks at the liver.

22. In his right hand is the divination for Jerusalem: to set up battering rams, to call for a slaughter, to lift the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to heap up a mound, and to build a siege wall.

23. And it will be to them like a false divination in the eyes of those who have sworn oaths with them; but he will bring their iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken.

24. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear; because you have come to remembrance, you shall be taken with the hand.

25. Now to you, O slain, wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come, whose iniquity shall end,

26. thus says the Lord Jehovah: Remove the turban, and take off the crown; nothing shall remain as it was. Exalt the humble, and humble the exalted.

27. Ruin, ruin! I will ruin it! It shall be no more, until He comes whose right it is. And I will give it to Him.

28. And you, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah concerning the Ammonites and concerning their reproach; and say, A sword, a sword is drawn, polished for slaughter, for consuming, for flashing;

29. while they see false visions for you, while they divine a lie to you, to bring you upon the necks of the slain, the wicked whose day has come, whose iniquity shall end.

30. Return it to its sheath. I will judge you in the place where you were created, in the land of your birth.

31. And I will pour out My indignation upon you; I will blow against you with the fire of My wrath, and deliver you into the hands of brutal men who are skilled in destruction.

32. You shall be fuel for the fire; your blood shall be in the midst of the land. You shall not be remembered, for I, Jehovah, have spoken.

## Ezekiel 22

1. Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

2. And you, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Yes, show her all her abominations!

3. Then say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: The city sheds blood in her midst, that her time may come. And she makes idols within herself to defile herself.

4. You are guilty by the blood which you have shed, and have defiled yourself with the idols which you have made. You have caused your days to draw near, and have come to your years. Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mockery to all lands.

5. Those who are near and those far from you will mock you as defiled of name and full of confusion.

6. Behold, the rulers of Israel: each one was in you by his power to shed blood in you.

7. In you they have made light of father and mother; in your midst they have oppressed the sojourner; in you they have mistreated the orphan and the widow.

8. You have despised My holy things and profaned My Sabbaths.

9. In you are men who slander to cause bloodshed; in you they eat on the mountains; in your midst they commit lewdness.

10. In you men uncover the nakedness of their fathers; in you they humble women during their menstrual impurity.

11. One commits abomination with his neighbors wife; another lewdly defiles his daughter-in-law; and another in you humbles his sister, his fathers daughter.

12. In you they take bribes to shed blood; you take usury and increase; you have made profit from your neighbors by extortion, and have forgotten Me, declares the Lord Jehovah.

13. Behold, therefore, I have clapped My hands at the unjust gain which you have made, and at the blood which has been in your midst.

14. Can your heart endure, or can your hands remain strong, in the days when I shall deal with you? I, Jehovah, have spoken, and will do it.

15. I will scatter you among the nations, disperse you throughout the earth, and destroy your filthiness out of you.

16. You shall defile yourself in the eyes of the nations; and you shall know that I am Jehovah.

17. The Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

18. Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to Me; they are all bronze, tin, iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are the dross of silver.

19. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have all become dross, therefore behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.

20. As men gather silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin into the midst of the furnace, to blow fire on it to melt it; so I will gather you in My anger and in My fury, and I will leave you there and melt you.

21. Yes, I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of My wrath, and you shall be melted in its midst.

22. As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall you be melted in its midst. And you shall know that I, Jehovah, have poured out My fury upon you.

23. And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

24. Son of man, say to her: You are a land that is not cleansed or rained on in the day of indignation.

25. The conspiracy of her prophets in her midst is like a roaring lion tearing the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in her midst.

26. Her priests have violated My Law and defiled My holy things; they have not divided between the holy and profane, nor have they declared between the unclean and the clean; and they have hidden their eyes from My Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them.

27. Her rulers in her midst are like wolves tearing the prey, to shed blood, to destroy souls, and to get dishonest gain.

28. Her prophets plastered them with whitewash, seeing vain visions, and divining lies to them, saying, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, when Jehovah has not spoken.

29. The people of the land have used oppressions, committed robbery, and mistreated the poor and needy; and they wrongfully oppress the sojourner.

30. So I sought for a man among them who would close up the wall, and stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found no one.

31. Therefore I have poured out My indignation on them; I have consumed them with the fire of My wrath; and I have recompensed their deeds upon their own heads, declares the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 23

1. The Word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying:

2. Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother.

3. They committed harlotry in Egypt, they committed harlotry in their youth; their breasts were handled, their virgin nipples were fondled.

4. Their names: Oholah the elder and Oholibah her sister; they were Mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem is Oholibah.

5. Oholah committed adultery even though she was Mine; and she lusted for her lovers, the neighboring Assyrians,

6. who were clothed in purple, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.

7. Thus she committed her adultery with them, all of them choice men of Assyria; and with all for whom she lusted, with all their idols, she defiled herself.

8. She has never given up her harlotry brought from Egypt, for in her youth they had lain with her, fondled her virgin breasts, and poured out their immorality upon her.

9. Therefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, for whom she lusted.

10. They uncovered her nakedness, took away her sons and daughters, and slew her with the sword; she became a byword among women, for they had executed judgment on her.

11. Now although her sister Oholibah saw this, she became more corrupt in her lust than she, and in her harlotry, more than her sisters harlotry.

12. She lusted for the neighboring Assyrians, captains and rulers, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men.

13. Then I saw that she was defiled; both the same way.

14. But she added to her harlotry; she looked at men portrayed on the wall, images of Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion,

15. girded with waistbands around their waists, flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like officers, in the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their birth.

16. As soon as her eyes saw them, she lusted for them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.

17. And the Babylonians came to her, into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their immorality; so she was defiled by them, and her soul was alienated from them.

18. So she uncovered her harlotry and uncovered her nakedness. Then My soul was alienated from her, just as My soul was alienated from her sister.

19. Yet she multiplied her harlotry in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, when she had committed adultery in the land of Egypt.

20. For she lusted for her paramours, whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.

21. Thus you called to remembrance the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians fondled your nipples because of your youthful breasts.

22. Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will stir up your lovers against you, from whom your soul is alienated, and I will bring them against you from every side:

23. The Babylonians, all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, Koa, all the Assyrians with them, all of them desirable young men, governors and rulers, officers and men of renown, all of them riding on horses.

24. And they shall come against you with chariots, wagons, and wheels, with a company of people. They shall array against you buckler, shield, and helmet all around. I will entrust judgment to them, and they shall judge you according to their judgments.

25. I will set My jealousy against you, and they shall deal furiously with you; they shall remove your nose and your ears, and the rest of you shall fall by the sword; they shall take your sons and your daughters, and the rest of you shall be devoured by fire.

26. They shall also strip you of your clothes and take away your beautiful jewelry.

27. Thus I will make you cease your lewdness and your harlotry brought from the land of Egypt, so that you will not lift your eyes to them, nor remember Egypt anymore.

28. For thus says the Lord Jehovah: Surely I will deliver you into the hand of those you hate, into the hand of those from whom your soul is alienated.

29. They will deal hatefully with you, take away all you have worked for, and leave you naked and bare. The nakedness of your adultery shall be uncovered, both your lewdness and your harlotry.

30. I will do these things to you because you have gone whoring after the nations, because you have become defiled by their idols.

31. You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will put her cup into your hand.

32. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: You shall drink of your sisters cup, deep and wide; you shall be laughed to scorn and held in derision; for it contains much.

33. You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, the cup of horror and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria.

34. You shall drink and drain it, you shall break its shards, and tear off your own breasts; for I have spoken, declares the Lord Jehovah.

35. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have forgotten Me and cast Me behind your back, therefore you shall bear the penalty of your lewdness and your harlotry.

36. Jehovah also said to me: Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations.

37. For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols, and even sacrificed their sons whom they bore to Me, passing them through the fire, to devour them.

38. Moreover they have done this to Me: They have defiled My sanctuary on the same day and profaned My Sabbaths.

39. For after they had slain their children to their idols, on the same day they came into My sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, this they have done in the midst of My house.

40. Furthermore you sent for men to come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent; and there they came. And you washed yourself for them, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with ornaments.

41. You sat on a stately couch, with a table prepared before it, on which you had set My incense and My oil.

42. And the sound of a multitude at ease was with her, and drunkards were brought from the wilderness with men of the common sort, who put bracelets on their wrists and beautiful crowns on their heads.

43. Then I said concerning her who was worn out in adulteries, Will they commit adultery with her now, and she with them?

44. Yet they went in to her, as men go in to a woman of harlotry; thus they went in to Oholah and Oholibah, the lewd women.

45. And righteous men will judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands.

46. For thus says the Lord Jehovah: Bring up an assembly against them, give them up to terror and plunder.

47. And the company shall stone them with stones and cut them down with their swords. They shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn their houses with fire.

48. Thus I will bring an end to lewdness from the land, that all women may be taught not to do according to your lewdness.

49. And they shall repay you for your lewdness, and you shall pay for your idolatrous sins. And you shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 24

1. Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, write down the name of the day, this very day; the king of Babylon has leaned against Jerusalem this very day.

3. And utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Put on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it.

4. Gather pieces of meat into it, every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder. Fill it with choice cuts;

5. take the choice of the flock. Also pile bones under it, boil it to boiling, and let the cuts simmer in it.

6. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is in it, and whose scum is not gone from it! Bring it out piece by piece. Let no lot fall on it.

7. For her blood is in her midst; she set it on top of a rock; she did not pour it on the ground, to cover it with dust.

8. That it may raise up fury and take vengeance, I have set her blood on top of a rock, that it may not be covered.

9. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city! I too will make the pyre great.

10. Heap on the wood, kindle the fire; cook the flesh well, mix in the spices, and let the bones be burned.

11. Then set the pot empty on the coals, that it may become hot and its bronze may burn, that its filthiness may be melted in it, that its scum may be consumed.

12. She has grown weary with toil, and her great scum has not gone from her. Let her scum be in the fire!

13. In your filthiness is lewdness. Because I have cleansed you, and you were not cleansed, you will not be cleansed of your filthiness anymore, till I have caused My fury to rest upon you.

14. I, Jehovah, have spoken it; it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not hold back, nor will I spare, nor will I have compassion; according to your ways and according to your deeds they will judge you, declares the Lord Jehovah.

15. Also the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

16. Son of man, behold, I am taking away from you the desire of your eyes with one stroke; yet you shall neither mourn nor weep, nor shall your tears run down.

17. Groan in silence, make no mourning for the dead; bind your turban on your head, and put your sandals on your feet; do not cover your mustache, and do not eat the bread of men of sorrow.

18. So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died; and in the morning I did as I was commanded.

19. And the people said to me, Will you not tell us what these things signify to us, that you behave so?

20. Then I answered them, The Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

21. Speak to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will profane My sanctuary, the pride of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and daughters whom you left behind shall fall by the sword.

22. And you shall do as I have done; you shall not cover your mustaches nor eat the bread of men of sorrow.

23. Your turbans shall be on your heads and your sandals on your feet; you shall neither mourn nor weep, but you shall rot away in your iniquities and mourn with one another.

24. Thus Ezekiel is a sign to you; according to all that he has done you shall do; and when this comes, you shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.

25. And you, son of man; will it not be in the day when I take from them their stronghold, their joy and their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that upon which they set their hearts, their sons and their daughters.

26. On that day one who escapes will come to you to cause you to hear it with your ears;

27. on that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped; you shall speak and no longer be mute. Thus you will be a sign to them, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 25

1. The Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them.

3. Say to the Ammonites, Hear the Word of the Lord Jehovah! Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you said, Aha! against My sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into captivity,

4. behold, therefore, I will deliver you as a possession to the men of the East, and they shall set their encampments among you and make their dwellings among you; they shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk.

5. And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels and Ammon a resting place for flocks. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.

6. For thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you clapped your hands, stamped your feet, and rejoiced in heart with all your contempt for the land of Israel,

7. behold, therefore, I will stretch out My hand against you, and give you as plunder to the nations; I will cut you off from the peoples, and I will cause you to perish from the earth; I will destroy you, and you shall know that I am Jehovah.

8. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because Moab and Seir say, Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations,

9. therefore, behold, I will clear the territory of Moab of cities, of the cities on its borders, the glory of the land, Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kirjathaim.

10. To the men of the East I will give it as a possession, along with the Ammonites, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.

11. And I will execute judgments upon Moab, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.

12. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because of what Edom did against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has become very guilty from avenging itself on them,

13. therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will also stretch out My hand against Edom, cut off man and beast from it, and make it desolate. From Teman even to Dedan they shall fall by the sword.

14. I will lay My vengeance on Edom by the hand of My people Israel, that they may do in Edom according to My anger and according to My fury; and they shall know My vengeance, declares the Lord Jehovah.

15. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because the Philistines dealt with vengeance and took vengeance with spite in their heart, to destroy because of the old hatred,

16. therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will stretch out My hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites and destroy the rest of the seacoast.

17. I will execute great vengeance on them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I lay My vengeance upon them.

## Ezekiel 26

1. And it came to pass in the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, that the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, because Tyre has said against Jerusalem, Aha! She is broken who was the gateway of the peoples; now she is turned over to me; I shall be filled; she is laid waste.

3. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against you, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against you, as the sea causes its waves to come up.

4. And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers; I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like a shiny rock.

5. It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken, says the Lord Jehovah; it shall become plunder for the nations.

6. And her daughters who are in the fields shall be slain by the sword. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.

7. For thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring against Tyre from the north Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, a king of kings, with horses, with chariots, and with horsemen, and a company of many people.

8. He will slay your daughters with the sword in the fields; he will heap up a mound against you, build a siege wall against you, and raise a shield against you.

9. He will set his battering rams against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers.

10. Because of the abundance of his horses, their dust will cover you; your walls will shake at the sound of the horsemen, the wheels, and the chariots, when he enters your gates, as men enter a city that has been breached.

11. With the hooves of his horses he will trample all your streets; he will slay your people by the sword, and your strong pillars will fall to the ground.

12. And they will plunder your riches and pillage your merchandise; they will break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses; they will put your stones, your timber, and your soil in the midst of the water.

13. And I will put an end to the noise of your songs, and the sound of your harps shall be heard no more.

14. And I will make you like a shiny rock, you shall be a place for the spreading of nets, and you shall never be rebuilt; for I, Jehovah, have spoken, declares the Lord Jehovah.

15. Thus says the Lord Jehovah to Tyre: Will the coastlands not shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is slain in your midst?

16. Then all the rulers of the sea will come down from their thrones, lay aside their robes, and take off their embroidered garments; they will clothe themselves with trembling; they will sit on the ground, tremble every moment, and be astonished at you.

17. And they will take up a lamentation for you, and say to you: How you have perished, O one inhabited by seafaring men, O renowned city, who was strong at sea, she and her inhabitants, who caused their terror to be on all her inhabitants!

18. Now the coastlands shall tremble in the day of your fall; Yes, the coastlands by the sea shall be troubled at your departure.

19. For thus says the Lord Jehovah: When I make you a desolate city, like cities that are not inhabited, when I bring the deep upon you, and great waters cover you,

20. then I will bring you down with those who descend into the Pit, with the people of old, and I will make you dwell in the lowest part of the earth, in places desolate from antiquity, with those who go down to the Pit, so that you may never be inhabited; and I shall establish glory in the land of the living.

21. I will make you a terror, and you shall be no more; though you are sought for, you will never be found again, declares the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 27

1. The Word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,

2. Now, son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyre,

3. and say to Tyre, You who are situated at the entrance of the sea, merchant of the peoples on many coastlands, thus says the Lord Jehovah: O Tyre, you have said, I am perfect in beauty.

4. Your borders are in the midst of the seas. Your builders have perfected your beauty.

5. They made all your planks of fir trees from Senir; they took a cedar from Lebanon to make you a mast.

6. Of oaks from Bashan they made your oars; the company of the Ashurites have inlaid your planks with ivory from the coasts of Kittim.

7. Fine embroidered linen from Egypt was what you spread for your sail; violet and purple from the coasts of Elishah was what covered you.

8. The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your oarsmen; your wise men, O Tyre, were in you; they became your sailors.

9. The elders of Gebal and its wise men were in you to caulk your seams; all the ships of the sea and their oarsmen were in you to exchange your merchandise.

10. Those from Persia, Lydia, and Libya were in your army as men of war; they hung shield and helmet in you; they gave splendor to you.

11. Men of Arvad with your army were on your walls all around, and the men of Gammad were in your towers; they hung their shields on your walls all around; they made your beauty perfect.

12. Tarshish traded with you because of the multitude of your wealth. They gave you silver, iron, tin, and lead for your goods.

13. Javan, Tubal, and Meshech traded with you. They exchanged souls of men and vessels of bronze for your merchandise.

14. Those from the house of Togarmah traded for your wares with horses, steeds, and mules.

15. The men of Dedan traded with you; many shores were the market of your hand. They brought you ivory tusks and ebony as payment.

16. Syria traded with you because of the abundance of goods you made. They exchanged for your wares emeralds, purple, embroidery, fine linen, corals, and rubies.

17. Judah and the land of Israel traded with you. They exchanged for your merchandise wheat of Minnith, millet, honey, oil, and balm.

18. Damascus traded with you because of the abundance of goods you made, because of your great wealth, with the wine of Helbon and with white wool.

19. Dan and Javan paid for your wares, traversing back and forth. Wrought iron, cassia, and cane were among your merchandise.

20. Dedan traded with you in saddlecloths for riding.

21. Arabia and all the rulers of Kedar traded with you regularly. They traded with you in lambs, rams, and goats.

22. The merchants of Sheba and Raamah traded with you. They exchanged for your wares the choicest spices, all kinds of precious stones, and gold.

23. Haran, Canneh, Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Assyria, and Chilmad traded with you.

24. These traded with you in choice items; in purple clothes, in embroidered work, in cedar chests of multicolored apparel, bound tightly with cords, which were in your marketplace.

25. The ships of Tarshish traveled with your merchandise. You were filled and very glorious in the midst of the seas.

26. Your oarsmen brought you into many waters, but the east wind has broken you in the midst of the seas.

27. Your riches, wares, and merchandise, your mariners and pilots, your caulkers and merchandisers, all your men of war who are in you, and the entire company which is in your midst, will fall into the midst of the seas on the day of your ruin.

28. The open lands will shake at the sound of the cry of your sailors.

29. All who handle the oar, the mariners, all the sailors of the sea will come down from their ships and stand on the land.

30. They will make their voice heard because of you; they will cry bitterly and cast dust on their heads; they will wallow in ashes;

31. and they will shave themselves completely bald because of you, gird themselves with sackcloth, and weep for you with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing.

32. And in their wailing for you they will take up a lamentation, and lament for you: What city is like Tyre, destroyed in the midst of the sea?

33. When your wares went out by sea, you satisfied many people; you enriched the kings of the earth with the abundance of your wealth and your merchandise.

34. But you are broken by the seas in the depths of the waters; your merchandise and the entire company will fall in your midst.

35. All the inhabitants of many shores will be astonished at you; their kings will be in dread, and their countenance will be enraged.

36. The merchants among the peoples will hiss at you; you will become a terror, and be no more forever.

## Ezekiel 28

1. The Word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying,

2. Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because your heart is lifted up, and you say, I am a god, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas, yet you are a man, and not the Mighty God, though you set your heart as the heart of God

3. (Behold, you are wiser than Daniel. There is no secret that can be hidden from you.

4. With your wisdom and your understanding you have gained riches for yourself, and gathered gold and silver into your treasuries;

5. by your great wisdom in trade you have increased your riches, and your heart is lifted up because of your riches).

6. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have set your heart as the heart of God,

7. behold, therefore, I will bring strangers against you, the most terrifying of the nations; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom, and defile your splendor.

8. They shall throw you down to the Pit, and you shall die the death of the slain in the midst of the seas.

9. Will you still think to say before him who slays you, I am God? But you are a man, and not a god, in the hand of him who slays you.

10. You shall die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers; for I have spoken, says the Lord Jehovah.

11. Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

12. Son of man, take up a lamentation for the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: You seal the measure, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.

13. You have been in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone was your covering: the sardius, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and emerald with gold. The workmanship of your timbrels and pipes was prepared for you on the day you were created.

14. You were the anointed cherub that covers; I established you; you were on the holy mountain of God; you walked back and forth in the midst of fiery stones.

15. You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created, till iniquity was found in you.

16. By the abundance of your trading they filled your midst with violence, and you sinned; therefore I cast you as profane out of the mountain of God; and I destroyed you, O covering cherub, from the midst of the fiery stones.

17. Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. I have cast you to the ground, I have set you before kings, that they might observe you.

18. You have defiled your sanctuaries by the multitude of your iniquities, by the iniquity of your trading; therefore I bring fire from your midst; it has devoured you, and I consign you to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all who see you.

19. All who know you among the peoples have been astonished at you; you shall become a terror, and shall be no more forever.

20. Then the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

21. Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against her,

22. and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against you, O Sidon; I will be glorified in your midst; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I execute judgments in her and have been sanctified in her.

23. For I will send pestilence upon her, and blood into her streets; the slain shall fall in her midst by the sword which is against her on every side; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.

24. And there shall no longer be a pricking brier or a painful thorn unto the house of Israel from all who surround them, who despise them. And they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.

25. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: When I have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and have been sanctified in them in the eyes of the nations, then they will dwell in their land which I gave to My servant Jacob.

26. And they shall dwell safely there, build houses, and plant vineyards; yes, they will dwell securely, when I execute judgments on all those around them who despise them. And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God.

## Ezekiel 29

1. In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt.

3. Speak, and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against you, O Pharaoh king of Egypt, O great monster who lies in the midst of his rivers, who has said, My River is my own; I have made it for myself.

4. But I will put hooks in your jaws, and cause the fish of your rivers to stick to your scales; I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers, and all the fish in your rivers will stick to your scales.

5. And I will leave you in the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers; you shall fall on the open field; you shall not be brought together nor gathered. I have given you as food to the beasts of the field and to the birds of the heavens.

6. And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am Jehovah, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.

7. When they took hold of you by the hand, you broke and tore all their shoulders; when they leaned on you, you broke and made all their loins stand.

8. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Surely I will bring a sword upon you and cut off from you man and beast.

9. And the land of Egypt shall become desolate and waste; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, because he has said, The River is mine, and I have made it.

10. Indeed, therefore, I am against you and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from Migdol to Syene, even to the border of Ethiopia.

11. Neither foot of man shall pass through it nor foot of beast shall pass through it, and it shall be uninhabited forty years.

12. And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the lands that are desolate; and among the cities that are laid waste, her cities shall be desolate forty years; and I will scatter Egypt among the nations and disperse them throughout the earth.

13. Yet, thus says the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years I will gather Egypt from the peoples there where they were scattered.

14. I will bring back the captives of Egypt and cause them to return to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin, and there they shall be a lowly kingdom.

15. It shall be the lowliest of kingdoms; it shall never again exalt itself above the nations, for I will diminish them so that they will not rule over the nations anymore.

16. No longer shall it be the confidence of the house of Israel, but will remind them of their iniquity when they turned to follow them. And they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.

17. And it came to pass in the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, that the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

18. Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to work hard against Tyre; every head was made bald, and every shoulder rubbed raw; yet neither he nor his army received wages from Tyre, for the labor which they expended on it.

19. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Surely I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. He shall take away her wealth, carry off her plunder, and remove her spoils; and that will be the wages for his army.

20. I have given him the land of Egypt for his labor, because they worked for Me, declares the Lord Jehovah.

21. In that day I will cause the horn of the house of Israel to spring forth, and I will open your mouth to speak in their midst. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 30

1. The Word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying,

2. Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Howl, Alas for the day!

3. For the day is near, even the day of Jehovah is near; it will be a day of clouds, the time of the nations.

4. And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they take away her wealth, and her foundations are broken down.

5. Ethiopia, Libya, Lydia, all the mixed people, Chub, and the men of the lands who are allied, shall fall with them by the sword.

6. Thus says Jehovah: Those who support Egypt shall fall, and the pride of her power shall come down. From Migdol to Syene those within her shall fall by the sword, declares the Lord Jehovah.

7. And they shall be desolate in the midst of the desolate lands, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are laid waste.

8. And they will know that I am Jehovah, when I have set a fire in Egypt and all her helpers have been destroyed.

9. In that day messengers shall go forth from Me in ships to make the confident Ethiopians afraid, and great anguish shall come upon them, as in the day of Egypt; for indeed it is coming!

10. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will also bring an end to the multitude of Egypt by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.

11. He and his people with him, the most ruthless of the nations, shall be brought to destroy the land; they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.

12. I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of evil ones; I will make the land waste, and all that is in it, by the hand of strangers. I, Jehovah, have spoken.

13. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will also destroy the idols, and remove the images from Noph; there shall no longer be a prince of the land of Egypt; and I will put fear in the land of Egypt.

14. I will make Pathros desolate, set fire to Zoan, and execute judgments in No.

15. I will pour My fury on Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No,

16. and set a fire in Egypt; Sin shall writhe in anguish, No shall be split open, and Noph shall be in daily distress.

17. The young men of Aven and Pibeseth shall fall by the sword, and these cities shall go into captivity.

18. At Tahpanhes the day shall also be darkened, when I break the yokes of Egypt there. And her arrogant strength shall come to an end in her; as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.

19. Thus I will execute judgments on Egypt, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.

20. And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, that the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

21. Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and see, it has not been bound up for healing, nor a bandage set to bind it, to make it strong to hold a sword.

22. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and will break his arms, both the strong one and the one that was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.

23. I will scatter Egypt among the nations, and disperse them throughout the earth.

24. And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put My sword in his hand; but I will break Pharaohs arms, and he will groan before him with the groanings of a mortally wounded man.

25. Thus I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down. And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I put My sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he shall have stretched it out against the land of Egypt.

26. And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the earth. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 31

1. And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, that the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude: Whom are you like in your greatness?

3. Behold, Assyria was like a cedar in Lebanon, with fine branches that shaded the forest, and of high stature; and its top was among the thick boughs.

4. The waters made it grow; the depths gave it height, with their rivers running around the place where it was planted, and sent out rivulets to all the trees of the field.

5. Therefore its height was exalted above all the trees of the field; its boughs were multiplied, and its branches became long because of the abundance of water, as it sent them out.

6. All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs; under its branches all the beasts of the field brought forth their young; and in its shadow all great nations made their home.

7. Thus it was beautiful in greatness and in the length of its branches, because its roots reached to abundant waters.

8. The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it; the fir trees were not like its boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like its branches; no tree in the garden of God was like it in beauty.

9. I made it beautiful with a multitude of branches, so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied it.

10. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have increased in height, and it set its top among the thick boughs, and its heart was lifted up in its height,

11. therefore I have delivered it into the hand of the Mighty God of the nations, and He shall surely deal with it; I have driven it out for its wickedness.

12. And strangers, the most terrifying of the nations, have cut it down and left it; its branches have fallen on the mountains and in all the valleys; its boughs lie broken by all the ravines of the land; and all the peoples of the earth have gone from under its shadow and left it.

13. On its ruin will dwell all the birds of the heavens, and all the beasts of the field shall be on its branches;

14. so that no trees by the waters may ever again exalt themselves for their height, nor set their tops among the thick boughs, that no tree which drinks water may ever be high enough to reach up to them. For they have all been delivered to death, to the lower parts of the earth, among the sons of men who go down to the Pit.

15. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: In the day when it went down to Sheol, I caused mourning. I covered the deep for it. I restrained its rivers, and the great waters were held back. I caused Lebanon to mourn for it, and all the trees of the field wilted because of it.

16. I made the nations shake at the sound of its fall, when I cast it down to Sheol together with those who descend into the Pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the depths of the earth.

17. They also went down to Sheol with it, with those slain by the sword; and those who were its arm, who dwelt in its shadows among the nations.

18. To which of the trees in Eden will you then be likened in glory and greatness? Yet you shall be brought down with the trees of Eden to the depths of the earth; you shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, declares the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 32

1. And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, that the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and say to him: You are like a young lion among the nations, and you are like a monster in the seas, bursting forth in your rivers, stirring up the waters with your feet, and fouling their rivers.

3. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will therefore spread My net over you with a company of many people, and they will draw you up in My net.

4. Then I will leave you on the land; I will cast you out upon the open fields, and cause all the birds of the heavens to settle on you. And I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with you.

5. I will lay your flesh on the mountains, and fill the valleys with your corpses.

6. I will also water the land with the flow of your blood, even to the mountains; and the ravines will be full of you.

7. When I extinguish you, I will cover the heavens, and make its stars dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light.

8. All the bright lights of the heavens I will make dark over you, and bring darkness upon your land, declares the Lord Jehovah.

9. I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I bring your ruin among the nations, into the lands which you have not known.

10. Yes, I will make many peoples astonished at you, and their kings shall be horribly afraid at you when I brandish My sword before them; and they shall tremble every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of your fall.

11. For thus says the Lord Jehovah: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon you.

12. By the swords of the mighty, all of them the most terrifying of the nations, I will cause your multitude to fall. They shall plunder the majesty of Egypt, and all its multitude shall be destroyed.

13. I will also destroy all its animals from beside its great waters; the foot of man shall muddy them no more, nor shall the hooves of animals stir them up.

14. Then I will make their waters settle, and make their rivers run like oil, says the Lord Jehovah.

15. When I make the land of Egypt desolate, and the land is destitute of all that once filled it, when I strike all who dwell in it, then they shall know that I am Jehovah.

16. This is the lamentation with which they shall lament her; the daughters of the nations shall lament her; they shall lament for her, for Egypt, and for all her multitude, says the Lord Jehovah.

17. It came to pass also in the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, that the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying:

18. Son of man, wail over the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down to the lowest parts of the earth, her and the daughters of the majestic nations, with those who go down to the Pit:

19. Whom do you surpass in beauty? Go down, be laid with the uncircumcised.

20. They shall fall in the midst of those slain by the sword; she is delivered to the sword, drawing her and all her multitudes.

21. The mighty among the strong shall speak to him out of the midst of Sheol with those who help him: they have gone down, they lie with the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.

22. Assyria is there, and all her company, with their graves all around her, all of them slain, fallen by the sword.

23. Her graves are set in the recesses of the Pit, and her company is all around her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living.

24. There is Elam and all her multitude, all around her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who have gone down uncircumcised to the lower parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living. Now they bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit.

25. They have set her bed in the midst of the slain, with all her multitude, with her graves all around it, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet they bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit; it was put in the midst of the slain.

26. There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitudes, with all their graves around it, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living.

27. They do not lie with the mighty of the uncircumcised who are fallen, who have gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war; they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities will be on their bones, though the terror of the mighty was in the land of the living.

28. Yes, you shall be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and lie with those slain by the sword.

29. There is Edom, her kings and all her rulers, who with their might are laid beside those slain by the sword; they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with those who go down to the Pit.

30. There are the rulers of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down with the slain, in shame at the terror which they caused by their might; they lie uncircumcised with those slain by the sword, and bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit.

31. Pharaoh will see them and be comforted over all his multitude, Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, declares the Lord Jehovah.

32. For I have caused My terror in the land of the living; and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with those slain by the sword, Pharaoh and all his multitude, declares the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 33

1. Again the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and say to them: When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from their borders and make him their watchman,

3. when he sees the sword coming upon the land, if he blows the shofar and warns the people,

4. then whoever listens to hear the sound of the shofar and does not take warning, if the sword comes and takes him away, his blood shall be on his own head.

5. He heard the sound of the shofar, but did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself. But he who takes warning will save his soul.

6. But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the shofar, and the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any soul from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity. But his blood I will require at the watchmans hand.

7. So you, son of man: I have made you a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore you shall hear the Word from My mouth and warn them from Me.

8. When I say to the wicked, O wicked man, you shall die the death! and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand.

9. Nevertheless if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.

10. Therefore you, O son of man, say to the house of Israel: Thus you say, If our transgressions and our sins lie upon us, and we pine away in them, how can we then live?

11. Say to them: As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, I take no delight in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! For why will you die, O house of Israel?

12. Therefore you, O son of man, say to the children of your people: The righteousness of the righteous man shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression. As for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall because of it in the day that he turns from his wickedness; nor shall the righteous be able to live because of his righteousness in the day that he sins.

13. When I say to the righteous that he shall live life, but he trusts in his own righteousness and commits iniquity, none of all his righteousness shall be remembered; but because of the iniquity that he has done, he shall die.

14. Again, when I say to the wicked, You shall die the death; if he turns from his sin and does justice and righteousness,

15. if the wicked restores the pledge, gives back what he has stolen, and walks in the statutes of life, not committing iniquity, he shall live life; he shall not die.

16. None of all his sins which he has sinned shall be remembered against him; he has done justice and righteousness; he shall live life.

17. Yet the children of your people say, The way of Jehovah is not fair. But as for them, it is their way which is not fair!

18. When the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he shall die because of it.

19. But when the wicked turns from his wickedness and does justice and righteousness, he shall live because of it.

20. Yet you say, The way of Jehovah is not fair. O house of Israel, I shall judge each one of you according to his ways.

21. And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, that one who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said, The city has been struck!

22. Now the hand of Jehovah had been upon me the evening before the man came who had escaped. And He had opened my mouth; so when he came to me in the morning, my mouth was opened, and I was no longer mute.

23. Then the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying:

24. Son of man, they who inhabit the ruins in the land of Israel are saying, Abraham was one, and he took possession of the land. But we are many; the land is given to us as a possession.

25. Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: You eat meat with blood, you lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood. Shall you then possess the land?

26. You rely on your sword, you commit abominations, and you defile each one his neighbors wife. Shall you then possess the land?

27. Say thus to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely those who are in the ruins shall fall by the sword, and the one who is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who are in the strongholds and caves shall die of the pestilence.

28. For I will make the land a desolate waste, her arrogant strength shall cease, and the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that no one will pass through.

29. Then they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have made the land a desolate waste because of all their abominations which they have done.

30. As for you, son of man, the children of your people are talking about you beside the walls and in the doors of the houses; and they speak to one another, everyone saying to his brother, Please come and hear what the Word is that comes from Jehovah.

31. So they come to you as people do, they sit before you as My people, and they hear your words, but they do not do them; for with their mouth they act out love, but their hearts go after their unjust gain.

32. Indeed you are to them as a singer of love songs, as one who has a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument; for they hear your words, but they do not do them.

33. So when this comes to pass (surely it will come); then they will know that a prophet has been among them.

## Ezekiel 34

1. And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah to the shepherds: Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flocks?

3. You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool; you slaughter the fatlings, but you do not feed the flock.

4. The weak you have not strengthened, nor have you healed those who were sick, nor bound up the broken, nor brought back what was driven away, nor sought what was lost; but with force and cruelty you have ruled them.

5. So they were scattered because there was no shepherd; and they became food for all the beasts of the field when they were scattered.

6. My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill; yes, My flock was scattered over the whole face of the earth, and no one was seeking or searching for them.

7. Therefore, you shepherds, hear the Word of Jehovah:

8. As I live, says the Lord Jehovah, surely because My flock became a prey, and My flock became food for every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, nor did My shepherds search for My flock, but the shepherds fed themselves and did not feed My flock;

9. therefore, O shepherds, hear the Word of Jehovah!

10. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will require My flock at their hand; I will cause them to cease feeding the sheep, and the shepherds shall feed themselves no more; for I will deliver My flock from their mouths, that they may no longer be food for them.

11. For thus says the Lord Jehovah: Indeed I Myself will search for My sheep and seek them out.

12. As a shepherd seeks out his flock on the day he is among his scattered sheep, so will I seek out My sheep and deliver them from all the places where they were scattered on a cloudy and dark day.

13. And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the lands, and will bring them to their own land; I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines and in all the dwelling places of the land.

14. I will feed them in a good pasture, and their fold shall be on the high mountains of Israel. There they shall lie down in a good fold and feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.

15. I will feed My flock, and I will make them lie down, declares the Lord Jehovah.

16. I will seek what was lost and bring back what was driven away, bind up the broken and strengthen what was sick; but I will destroy the fat and the strong, and feed them with judgment.

17. And as for you, O My flock, thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I shall judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and he goats.

18. Is it a small thing for you to have eaten up the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture; and to have drunk of the clear waters, that you must foul the rest with your feet?

19. And as for My flock, they eat what you have trampled with your feet, and they drink what you have fouled with your feet.

20. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah to them: Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.

21. Because you have pushed with side and shoulder, thrust at all the weak ones with your horns, and scattered them abroad,

22. therefore I will save My flock, and they shall no longer be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.

23. I will raise up one Shepherd over them, and He shall feed them; My servant David. He shall feed them and be their Shepherd.

24. And I, Jehovah, will be their God, and My Servant David a prince among them; I, Jehovah, have spoken.

25. I will make a covenant of peace with them, and remove the evil beasts out of the land; and they will dwell safely in the wilderness and sleep in the wooded forests.

26. And I will make them and the places all around My hill a blessing; and I will cause showers to come down in their season; there shall be showers of blessing.

27. Then the trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase. They shall be safe in their land; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have broken the bars of their yoke and delivered them from the hand of those who enslaved them.

28. And they shall no longer be a prey for the nations, nor shall beasts of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and no one shall make them afraid.

29. I will raise up for them a notable plantation, and they shall no longer be consumed with hunger in the land, nor bear the shame of the nations any more.

30. Thus they shall know that I, Jehovah their God, am with them, and they, the house of Israel, are My people, declares the Lord Jehovah.

31. And you men, the flock of My pasture, are My flock; and I am your God, declares the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 35

1. Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir and prophesy against it,

3. and say to it, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, O Mount Seir, I am against you; I will stretch out My hand against you, and make you most desolate;

4. I shall lay your cities waste, and you shall be desolate. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.

5. Because you have had an ancient hatred, and have shed the blood of the children of Israel by the power of the sword at the time of their calamity, when their iniquity had come to an end;

6. therefore, as I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, I will prepare you for blood, and blood shall pursue you. Since you have not hated blood, therefore blood shall pursue you.

7. Thus I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste, and cut off from it the one who passes through and the one who returns.

8. And I will fill its mountains with the slain; on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines those who are slain by the sword shall fall.

9. I will make you desolate forever, and your cities shall not again be inhabited; and you shall know that I am Jehovah.

10. Because you have said, These two nations and these two lands shall be mine, and we will possess them (although Jehovah was there),

11. therefore, as I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, I will do according to your anger and according to the envy which you showed in your hatred against them; and I will make Myself known among them when I judge you.

12. And you shall know that I am Jehovah. I have heard all your blasphemies which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are desolate; they are given to us to consume.

13. Thus with your mouth you have boasted against Me and multiplied your words against Me; I have heard them.

14. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: The whole earth will rejoice when I make you desolate.

15. As you rejoiced because the inheritance of the house of Israel was desolate, so I will do to you. You shall be desolate, O Mount Seir, as well as all of Edom; all of it! And they shall know that I am Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 36

1. And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, O mountains of Israel, hear the Word of Jehovah!

2. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because the enemy has said of you, Aha! The ancient heights have become our possession,

3. therefore prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because they made you desolate and swallowed you up on every side, so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations, and you are taken up by the lips of talkers and slandered by the people;

4. therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the Word of the Lord Jehovah! Thus says the Lord Jehovah to the mountains, the hills, the rivers, the valleys, the desolate wastes, and the cities that have been forsaken, which became plunder and mockery to the rest of the nations all around;

5. therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Surely I have spoken in My burning jealousy against the rest of the nations and against Edom, all who gave My land to themselves as a possession, with whole-hearted joy and spiteful minds, in order to plunder its open land.

6. Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, the hills, the rivers, and the valleys, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I have spoken in My jealousy and My fury, because you have borne the shame of the nations.

7. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: I have raised My hand and sworn that surely the nations that are around you shall bear their shame.

8. But you, O mountains of Israel, you shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to My people Israel, for they are drawing near to come.

9. For indeed I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown.

10. I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt.

11. I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and be fruitful; I will make you inhabited as in former times, and do better for you than at your beginnings. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.

12. Yes, I will cause men to walk on you, My people Israel; they shall take possession of you, and you shall be their inheritance; no more shall you bereave them.

13. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because they say to you, You devour men and bereave your nation,

14. therefore you shall devour men no more, nor bereave your nation anymore, says the Lord Jehovah.

15. Nor will I let you hear the insults of the nations anymore, nor bear the reproach of the peoples anymore, nor shall you cause your nation to stumble anymore, says the Lord Jehovah.

16. Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying:

17. Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their land, they defiled it by their own ways and deeds. To Me their way was like the uncleanness of a woman in her menstrual impurity.

18. Therefore I poured out My fury on them because of the blood they had shed on the land, and because of their idols with which they had defiled it.

19. And I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed throughout the earth. I judged them according to their ways and their deeds.

20. When they came to the nations, wherever they went, they profaned My holy name. They said of them, These are the people of Jehovah, and they have come out of His land.

21. But I had compassion for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations, there where they went.

22. Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I do not do this for your sake, O house of Israel, but for the sake of My holy name, which you have profaned among the nations, there where you went.

23. And I will sanctify My great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst; and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, says the Lord Jehovah, when I am sanctified in you before their eyes.

24. For I will take you from among the nations, gather you out of all the lands, and bring you into your own land.

25. Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean; I will cleanse you from all your defilement and from all your idols.

26. I will also give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.

27. And I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you shall keep My judgments and do them.

28. And you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers. And you shall be My people, and I will be your God.

29. I will deliver you from all your defilements. I will call for the grain and multiply it, and bring no famine upon you.

30. And I will multiply the fruit of your trees and the produce of your fields, so that you never again bear the reproach of famine among the nations.

31. Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight, for your iniquities and your abominations.

32. Let it be known to you that I do not do this for your sakes, says the Lord Jehovah. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel!

33. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the ruins shall be rebuilt.

34. The desolate land shall be tilled instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass by.

35. And they will say, This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden; and the wasted, desolate, and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited.

36. Then the nations which are left all around you shall know that I, Jehovah, have rebuilt the ruined places and planted what was desolate. I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and I will do it.

37. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will also be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do this for them. I will increase their men like a flock.

38. Like a holy flock, like the flock of Jerusalem on its appointed feasts, so shall the ruined cities be filled with flocks of men. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 37

1. The hand of Jehovah was upon me and brought me out by the Spirit of Jehovah, and made me rest in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones.

2. Then He caused me to pass by them all around, and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and indeed they were very dry.

3. And He said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? So I answered, O Lord Jehovah, You know.

4. Again He said to me, Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the Word of Jehovah!

5. Thus says the Lord Jehovah to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live.

6. I will put sinews on you and bring flesh upon you, cover you with skin and put breath in you; and you shall live. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.

7. So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, a shaking; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.

8. And as I looked, the sinews and the flesh came upon them, and the skin covered them over; but there was no breath in them.

9. Then He said to me, Prophesy to the spirit; prophesy, son of man, and say to the spirit, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.

10. So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the spirit came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceedingly great army.

11. Then He said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, Our bones are dry, our hope is lost, and we ourselves are cut off!

12. Therefore prophesy and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, O My people, I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.

13. And you shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have opened your graves, O My people, and brought you up out of your graves.

14. I will put My Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. And you shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it and performed it, says Jehovah.

15. Again the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

16. Moreover, son of man, take a stick for yourself and write on it: For Judah and for the children of Israel, his companions. Then take another stick and write on it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and all the house of Israel, his companions.

17. Then join them one to another for yourself into one stick, and they will become one in your hand.

18. And when the children of your people speak to you, saying, Will you not show us what you mean by these?

19. say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel, his companions; and I will join them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they will be one in My hand.

20. And the sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes.

21. And say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, there where they have gone, and will gather them from every side and bring them into their own land;

22. and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king over them all; they shall no longer be two nations, nor shall they ever be divided into two kingdoms again.

23. They shall not defile themselves anymore with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will deliver them out of all their dwelling places where they have sinned, and will cleanse them. Thus they shall be My people, and I will be their God.

24. And David My servant shall be king over them, and they shall all have one Shepherd; they shall also walk in My judgments and keep My statutes, and do them.

25. And they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob My servant, where your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell there, they, their children, and their childrens children, always; and My servant David shall be their prince forever.

26. Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them, and it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; I will establish them and multiply them, and I will set My sanctuary in their midst forever.

27. My tabernacle also shall be with them; yes, I will be their God, and they shall be My people.

28. And the nations will know that I, Jehovah, sanctify Israel, when My sanctuary shall be in their midst forever.

## Ezekiel 38

1. And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, set your face against Gog, the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him,

3. and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal.

4. And I will turn you around, put hooks into your jaws, and lead you out, with all your army, horses, and horsemen, all splendidly clothed, a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords.

5. Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya are with them, all of them with shield and helmet;

6. Gomer and all its troops; the house of Togarmah from the far north and all its troops; and many people with you.

7. Prepare yourself and be ready, you and all your companies that are gathered about you; and be a guard to them.

8. After many days you will be visited. In the last final years you will come into the land of those brought back from the sword and gathered from many peoples on the mountains of Israel, which had long been desolate; they were brought out of the nations, and now all of them dwell safely.

9. You will ascend, and come like a storm, covering the land like a cloud, you and all your troops and many people with you.

10. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: On that day it shall come to pass that thoughts will arise in your mind, and you will devise an evil plan.

11. You shall say, I will go up against a land of unwalled villages; I will go to a people at peace, who dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates;

12. to plunder the spoils and to steal a prize, to stretch out your hand against the waste places that are again inhabited, and against a people gathered out of the nations, who produce livestock and goods, who dwell in the center of the earth.

13. Sheba, Dedan, the merchants of Tarshish, and all their young lions will say to you, Have you come to plunder the spoils? Have you gathered your army to steal a prize, to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, to plunder a great spoils?

14. Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: On that day when My people Israel dwell safely, will you not know it?

15. And you shall come from your place out of the recesses of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great company and a mighty army.

16. And you will come up against My people Israel like a cloud, to cover the land. It shall be in the last final days that I will bring you against My land, so that the nations may know Me, when I am sanctified in you, O Gog, before their eyes.

17. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Are you he of whom I have spoken in former days by My servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied for years in those days that I would bring you against them?

18. And it shall come to pass on that day, when Gog comes against the land of Israel, declares the Lord Jehovah, that My fury shall arise in My face.

19. For in My jealousy and in the fire of My wrath I have spoken. Surely in that day there shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel,

20. so that the fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, the beasts of the field, all creeping things that creep on the earth, and all men who are on the face of the earth shall quake at My presence. The mountains shall be thrown down, the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.

21. I will call for a sword against him throughout all My mountains, declares the Lord Jehovah. Every mans sword shall be against his brother.

22. And I will judge him with pestilence and blood; I will rain down upon him, on his troops, and on the many people who are with him, flooding rain, great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.

23. Thus I will magnify Myself and sanctify Myself, and I will be known in the eyes of many nations. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 39

1. And you, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal;

2. and I will turn you around and lead you on, bringing you up from the recesses of the north, and bring you upon the mountains of Israel.

3. And I will knock the bow out of your left hand, and cause the arrows to fall out of your right hand.

4. You shall fall upon the mountains of Israel, you and all your troops and the people who are with you. I will give you to the birds of prey of every sort and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.

5. You shall fall upon the open field; for I have spoken, declares the Lord Jehovah.

6. And I will send fire on Magog and on those who live in security in the coastlands. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.

7. Thus I will make My holy name known in the midst of My people Israel, and I will not let My holy name be profaned anymore. And the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel.

8. Behold, it is coming, and it shall be done, declares the Lord Jehovah. This is the day of which I have spoken.

9. And those who dwell in the cities of Israel will go out and set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and bucklers, the bows and arrows, the javelins and spears; and they shall kindle fires with them for seven years.

10. They will not take wood from the field nor cut down any from the forests, because they will kindle fires with the weapons; and they shall plunder those who plundered them, and pillage those who pillaged them, declares the Lord Jehovah.

11. It will come to pass in that day that I will give Gog a burial place there in Israel, the valley of those who pass by east of the sea; and it will stop the noses of travelers, because there they will bury Gog and all his multitude. Therefore they will call it the Valley of Hamon Gog.

12. For seven months the house of Israel shall be burying them, in order to cleanse the land.

13. Indeed all the people of the land will be burying, and they will gain renown for it on the day that I am glorified, declares the Lord Jehovah.

14. And they will assign men to continually pass through the land, traveling along, to bury those remaining on the face of the earth, in order to cleanse it. At the end of seven months they will make a search.

15. And any traveler passing through the land, when anyone sees a mans bone, he shall set up a marker by it, till the buriers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon Gog.

16. The name of the city will also be Hamonah. Thus they shall cleanse the land.

17. And as for you, son of man, thus says the Lord Jehovah, Speak to every sort of bird and to every beast of the field: Assemble yourselves and come; gather together from all sides to My sacrifice which I am sacrificing for you, a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you may eat flesh and drink blood.

18. You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, drink the blood of the rulers of the earth, of rams and lambs, of goats and bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan.

19. You shall eat fat till you are full, and drink blood till you are drunk, at My sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.

20. You shall be filled at My table with horses and riders, with mighty men and with all the men of war, says the Lord Jehovah.

21. And I will set My glory among the nations; all the nations shall see My judgments which I have executed, and My hand which I have laid on them.

22. Thus the house of Israel shall know that I am Jehovah their God from that day forward.

23. And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity; because they were unfaithful to Me, therefore I hid My face from them. I gave them into the hand of their enemies, and they all fell by the sword.

24. According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions I have dealt with them, and hidden My face from them.

25. Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Now I will bring back the captives of Jacob, and have mercy on the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous for My holy name;

26. after they have borne their shame, and all their treachery in which they were unfaithful to Me, when they dwelt safely in their own land and no one made them afraid.

27. When I have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them out of the lands of their enemies, and I am sanctified in them in the eyes of many nations,

28. then they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, who sent them into captivity among the nations, but also brought them back to their own land, and left none of them there.

29. And I will not hide My face from them anymore; for I have poured out My Spirit on the house of Israel, declares the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 40

1. In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was captured, on the very same day the hand of Jehovah was upon me; and He brought me there.

2. In the visions of God He brought me into the land of Israel and rested me on a very high mountain; on which toward the south was something like the structure of a city.

3. He brought me there, and behold, there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze. He had a line of flax and a measuring rod in his hand, and he stood in the gate.

4. And the man said to me, Son of man, look with your eyes and hear with your ears, and fix your mind on everything I show you; for you were brought here so that I might show them to you. Declare to the house of Israel everything you see.

5. Now there was a wall all around the outside of the house. In the mans hand was a measuring rod six cubits long, each being a cubit and a handbreadth; and he measured the width of the structure, one rod; and the height, one rod.

6. Then he went to the gate which faced east; and he went up its stairs and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one rod wide, and the other threshold was one rod wide.

7. Each guardroom was one rod long and one rod wide; between the guardrooms was a space of five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the inside gate was one rod.

8. He also measured the porch of the inside gate, one rod.

9. Then he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the pillars, two cubits. The porch of the gate was on the inside.

10. And in the eastward gate were three guardrooms on one side and three on the other; the three were all the same size; also the pillars were of the same size on this side and that side.

11. He measured the width of the entrance to the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.

12. And the space in front of the guardrooms was one cubit on this side and one cubit on that side; the guardrooms were six cubits on this side and six cubits on that side.

13. Then he measured the gate from the roof of one guardroom to the roof of the other; the width was twenty-five cubits, as door faces door.

14. He measured the pillars, sixty cubits high, and the court all around the gate extended to the pillar.

15. From the front of the entrance gate to the front of the porch of the inner gate was fifty cubits.

16. And there were shuttered windows in the guardrooms and in their pillars on the inside of the gate all around, and likewise in the arches. There were windows all around on the inside. And on each pillar were palm trees.

17. Then he brought me into the outer court; and there were rooms and a pavement made all around the court; thirty rooms faced the pavement.

18. The pavement was by the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates; this was the lower pavement.

19. Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner court exterior, one hundred cubits toward the east and the north.

20. On the outer court was also a gate facing north, and he measured its length and its width.

21. Its guardrooms, three on this side and three on that side, its pillars and its arches, had the same measurements as the first gate; its length was fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits.

22. Its windows and those of its porches, and also its palm trees, had the same measurements as the gate facing east; they went up to it by seven steps, and its arches were in front of it.

23. And the gate of the inner court was opposite the northern gate, just as the eastern gate; and he measured from gate to gate, one hundred cubits.

24. After that he brought me toward the south, and there a gate was facing south; and he measured its pillars and arches according to these same measurements.

25. There were windows in it and its arches all around like those windows; its length was fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits.

26. Seven steps led up to it, and its arches were in front of them; and it had palm trees on its pillars, one on this side and one on that side.

27. There was also a gate on the inner court, facing south; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south, one hundred cubits.

28. Then he brought me to the inner court through the southern gate; and he measured the southern gate according to these same measurements.

29. And its guardrooms, its pillars, and its arches were according to these same measurements; there were windows in it and in its arches all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.

30. There were arches all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide.

31. And its arches faced the outer court, palm trees were on its pillars, and going up to it were eight steps.

32. And he brought me into the inner court facing east; he measured the gate according to these same measurements.

33. Also its guardrooms, its pillars, and its arches were according to these same measurements; and there were windows in it and in its arches all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.

34. Its arches faced the outer court, and palm trees were on its pillars on this side and on that side; and going up to it were eight steps.

35. And he brought me to the north gate and measured it according to these same measurements;

36. also its guardrooms, its pillars, and its arches. It had windows all around; its length was fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits.

37. Its pillars faced the outer court, palm trees were on its pillars on this side and on that side, and going up to it were eight steps.

38. There was a room and its entrance by the pillars of the gate, where they washed the burnt offering.

39. In the porch of the gate were two tables on this side and two tables on that side, on which to slay the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.

40. At the outer side of the porch, as one goes up to the entrance of the northern gate, were two tables; and on the other side of the porch of the gate were two tables.

41. Four tables were on this side and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate, eight tables on which they slaughtered the sacrifices.

42. There were also four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, one cubit and a half long, one cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high; on these they laid the instruments with which they slaughtered the burnt offering and the sacrifice.

43. Inside were hooks, a handbreadth wide, fastened all around; and the flesh of the sacrifices was on the tables.

44. Outside the inner gate were the rooms for the singers in the inner court, one facing south beside the northern gate, and the other facing north beside the southern gate.

45. Then he said to me, This room which faces south is for the priests who have charge of the house.

46. The room which faces north is for the priests who have charge of the altar; these are the sons of Zadok, from the sons of Levi, who come near Jehovah to serve Him.

47. And he measured the court, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide, foursquare. And the altar was in front of the house.

48. And he brought me to the porch of the house and measured the pillars of the porch, five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side; and the width of the gate was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side.

49. The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits; and by the steps which led up to it there were columns by the pillars, one on this side and another on that side.

## Ezekiel 41

1. Then he brought me into the sanctuary and measured the pillars, six cubits wide on one side and six cubits wide on the other side; the width of the tent.

2. And the width of the entryway was ten cubits, and the side walls of the entrance were five cubits on this side and five cubits on the other side; and he measured its length, forty cubits, and its width, twenty cubits.

3. And he went inside and measured the doorposts, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits high; and the width of the entrance, seven cubits.

4. He measured the length, twenty cubits; and the width, twenty cubits, beyond the sanctuary; and he said to me, This is the Holy of Holies.

5. Next, he measured the wall of the house, six cubits. The width of each side room all around the house was four cubits on every side.

6. The side rooms were in three stories, one above the other, thirty rooms in each story; they rested on ledges which were for the side rooms all around, that they might be supported, but not fastened to the wall of the house.

7. As one went up from story to story, the side rooms became wider all around, because their supporting ledges in the wall of the house ascended like steps; therefore the width of the structure increased as one went up from the lowest story to the highest by way of the middle one.

8. I also saw the height of the house all around; the foundation of the side rooms was a full rod, that is, six cubits high.

9. The thickness of the outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits, and so was also the remaining area of the side rooms of the house.

10. And between it and the rooms was a width of twenty cubits all around the house on every side.

11. The doors of the side rooms opened toward the open area, one door toward the north and another toward the south; and the width of the open area was five cubits all around.

12. The building that faced the separate area at its western end was seventy cubits wide; the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.

13. So he measured the house, one hundred cubits long; and the separate area with the building and its walls was one hundred cubits long.

14. And the width of the eastern face of the house, including the separate area, was one hundred cubits.

15. And he measured the length of the building behind it, facing the separate area, with its galleries on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits, as well as the inner temple and the porches of the court,

16. their thresholds and the shuttered windows. And the galleries all around their three stories opposite the threshold were paneled with wood from the ground to the windows (the windows were covered),

17. from the space above the door, even to the inner room, as well as outside, and on every wall all around, inside and outside, by measure.

18. And it was made with cherubim and palm trees, a palm tree between cherub and cherub. And each cherub had two faces,

19. so that the face of a man was toward a palm tree on one side, and the face of a young lion toward a palm tree on the other side; thus it was made throughout the house all around.

20. From the ground to the space above the door, and on the wall of the temple, cherubim and palm trees were carved.

21. The doorposts of the temple were square, as was the front of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one was as the appearance of the other.

22. The altar of wood, was three cubits high, and its length two cubits. Its corners, its length, and its sides were of wood. And he said to me, This is the table that is before Jehovah.

23. The temple and the sanctuary had two doors.

24. The doors had two doors each, two turning doors: two for one door, and two doors for the other.

25. And Cherubim and palm trees were carved on the doors of the temple just like the ones carved on the walls. And wooden planks were on the front of the porch outside.

26. There were shuttered windows and palm trees on one side and on the other, on the sides of the porch; also on the side rooms of the house and on the planks.

## Ezekiel 42

1. Then he brought me out into the outer court, by the way toward the north; and he brought me into the room which was opposite the separate area, and which was in front of the building toward the north.

2. Facing the length, which was one hundred cubits (the width was fifty cubits), was the north door.

3. Opposite the inner court of twenty cubits, and opposite the pavement of the outer court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.

4. And in front of the rooms, toward the inside, was a walkway ten cubits wide, at a distance of one cubit; and their doors faced north.

5. Now the upper rooms were shorter, because the galleries took away space from them more than from the lower and middle stories of the building.

6. For they were in three stories and did not have pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore the upper level was shortened more than the lower and middle levels from the ground up.

7. And a wall which was outside ran alongside the rooms, at the front of the rooms, toward the outer court; its length was fifty cubits.

8. The length of the rooms toward the outer court was fifty cubits, whereas that facing the temple was one hundred cubits.

9. And under these rooms was the entrance on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court.

10. There were rooms in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, opposite the separate area and opposite the building.

11. And there was a walkway in front of them also, and their appearance was like the rooms which were toward the north; they were as long and as wide as the others, and all their exits and entrances were according to plan.

12. And corresponding to the doors of the rooms that were facing south, as one enters them, there was a door in front of the walkway, the walkway directly in front of the wall toward the east.

13. Then he said to me, The north rooms and the south rooms, which are opposite the separate area, are the holy rooms where the priests who approach Jehovah shall eat the set apart, holy, offerings. There they shall lay the set apart, holy, offerings; the grain offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.

14. When the priests enter them, they shall not go out of the holy room into the outer court; but there they shall leave their garments in which they minister, for they are holy. They shall put on other garments; then they may approach that which is for the people.

15. Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out through the gate that faces toward the east, and measured it all around.

16. He measured the east side with the measuring rod, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around.

17. He measured the north side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around.

18. He measured the south side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod.

19. He came around to the west side and measured five hundred rods by the measuring rod.

20. He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall all around, five hundred cubits long and five hundred wide, to separate the holy from the profane.

## Ezekiel 43

1. Afterward he brought me to the gate, the gate that faces toward the east.

2. And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone with His glory.

3. It was like the appearance of the vision which I saw; like the vision which I saw when I came to destroy the city. The visions were like the vision which I saw by the River Chebar; and I fell on my face.

4. And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by way of the gate which faces toward the east.

5. And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.

6. Then I heard Him speaking to me from the house. And standing beside me was a Man.

7. And He said to me, Son of man, this is the place of My throne and the place of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever. No more shall the house of Israel defile My holy name, they nor their kings, by their harlotry or with the carcasses of their kings on their high places.

8. When they set their threshold by My threshold, and their doorpost by My doorpost, with a wall between them and Me, they have defiled My holy name by the abominations which they have done; therefore I have consumed them in My anger.

9. Now let them put their harlotry and the carcasses of their kings far away from Me, and I will dwell in their midst forever.

10. Son of man, describe the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern.

11. And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the house and its arrangement, its exits and its entrances, its entire design and all its ordinances, all its forms and all its laws. Write it down in their sight, so that they may keep its whole design and all its ordinances, and do them.

12. This is the law of the house: The entire region around the mountaintop is set apart, holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.

13. These are the measurements of the altar in cubits (the cubit is one cubit and a handbreadth): the base one cubit high and one cubit wide, with a rim all around its edge of one span. This is the upper part of the altar:

14. from the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits; the width of the ledge, one cubit; from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits; and the width of the ledge, one cubit.

15. The altar hearth is four cubits high, with four horns extending upward from the hearth.

16. And the altar hearth is twelve cubits long, twelve wide, square at its four corners;

17. the ledge, fourteen cubits long and fourteen wide on its four sides, with a rim of half a cubit around it; its base, one cubit all around; and its steps face toward the east.

18. And He said to me, Son of man, thus says the Lord Jehovah: These are the ordinances for the altar on the day when it is made, for sacrificing burnt offerings on it, and for sprinkling blood on it.

19. And you shall give a young bull for a sin offering to the priests, the Levites (who are of the seed of Zadok, who approach Me to serve Me), says the Lord Jehovah.

20. You shall take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar, on the four corners of the ledge, and on the rim around it; thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it.

21. Then you shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and burn it at the appointed place of the house, outside the sanctuary.

22. On the second day you shall offer a kid of the goats that is whole for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed it with the bull.

23. When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a young bull that is whole, and a ram that is whole from the flock.

24. And you shall offer them before Jehovah, and the priests shall throw salt on them, and they shall offer them up as a burnt offering to Jehovah.

25. Every day for seven days you shall prepare a he goat for a sin offering; they shall also prepare a young bull and a ram from the flock, both that are whole.

26. Seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and purify it, and consecrate it.

27. And when these days are completed, it shall be, on the eighth day and thereafter, that the priests shall offer your burnt offerings and your peace offerings on the altar; and I will accept you, says the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 44

1. Then He brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary which faces toward the east. And it was shut.

2. And Jehovah said to me, This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter by it, because Jehovah the God of Israel has entered by it; therefore it shall be shut.

3. As for the prince, because he is the prince, he may sit in it to eat bread before Jehovah; he shall enter by way of the porch of the gate, and go out the same way.

4. Then He brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the house; and I looked, and behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah; and I fell on my face.

5. And Jehovah said to me, Son of man, mark well, see with your eyes and hear with your ears, all that I say to you concerning all the ordinances of the house of Jehovah and all its laws. Mark well the entrance to the house and all the exits from the sanctuary.

6. And say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: O house of Israel, Enough of all your abominations!

7. When you brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My sanctuary to defile it; My house; and when you offered My food, the fat and the blood, then they broke My covenant because of all your abominations.

8. And you have not kept charge of My holy things, but you have set others to keep charge of My sanctuary for you.

9. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart or uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter My sanctuary, including any son of a foreigner who is among the children of Israel.

10. And the Levites who went far from Me, when Israel went astray, who strayed away from Me after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity.

11. Yet they shall be ministers in My sanctuary, as gatekeepers of the house and ministers of the house; they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.

12. Because they ministered to them before their idols and caused the house of Israel to stumble into iniquity, therefore I have raised My hand and sworn against them, declares the Lord Jehovah; and they shall bear their iniquity.

13. And they shall not come near Me to serve Me as priest, nor come near any of My holy things, nor into the Holy of Holies; but they shall bear their shame and their abominations which they have done.

14. Nevertheless I will make them keep charge of the house, for all its labor, and for all that has to be done in it.

15. But the priests, the Levites, the sons of Zadok, who kept charge of My sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from Me, they shall come near Me to serve Me; and they shall stand before Me to offer to Me the fat and the blood, declares the Lord Jehovah.

16. They shall enter My sanctuary, and they shall come near My table to serve Me, and they shall keep My charge.

17. And it shall be, that whenever they enter the gates of the inner court, that they shall put on linen garments; no wool shall come upon them while they minister within the gates of the inner court or within the house.

18. They shall have linen turbans on their heads and linen trousers on their loins; they shall not clothe themselves with anything that causes sweat.

19. And when they go out to the outer court, to the outer court to the people, they shall take off their garments in which they have ministered, leave them in the holy rooms, and put on other garments; and in their own garments they shall not consecrate the people.

20. They shall neither shave their heads nor let their hair grow long; but they shall keep their hair clipped and trimmed.

21. No priest shall drink wine when he enters the inner court.

22. They shall not take as wife a widow or a divorced woman, but take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, or widows of priests.

23. And they shall teach My people the difference between the holy and the profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.

24. And in a dispute they shall stand as judges, and judge it according to My judgments. They shall keep My Laws and My statutes in all My appointed times, and they shall consecrate My Sabbaths.

25. They shall not defile themselves by coming near a dead person. Only for father or mother, for son or daughter, for brother or unmarried sister may they defile themselves.

26. After he is cleansed, they shall count seven days for him.

27. And on the day that he goes to the sanctuary to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering in the inner court, says the Lord Jehovah.

28. It shall be, in regard to their inheritance, that I am their inheritance. You shall give them no possession in Israel, for I am their possession.

29. They shall eat the food offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering; every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.

30. The first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every sacrifice of any kind from all your sacrifices, shall be for the priests; you shall also give to the priest the first of your ground meal, to cause a blessing to rest on your house.

31. The priests shall not eat anything, bird or beast, that died naturally or was torn by wild beasts.

## Ezekiel 45

1. Moreover, when you divide the land by lot for inheritance, you shall offer a heave offering unto Jehovah, a holy portion of the land; its length shall be twenty-five thousand cubits, and the width ten thousand. It shall be holy throughout its borders all around.

2. Of this there shall be a square plot for the sanctuary, five hundred by five hundred rods, with fifty cubits around it for an open space.

3. So this is the district you shall measure: twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand wide; in it shall be the sanctuary, the Holy of Holies.

4. It shall be a holy portion of the land for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to serve Jehovah; it shall be a place for their houses and a sacred place for the sanctuary.

5. An area twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand wide shall be for the Levites, the ministers of the house; they shall have twenty rooms as a possession.

6. You shall appoint as the property of the city an area five thousand cubits wide and twenty-five thousand long, next to the set-apart offerings; it shall belong to the whole house of Israel.

7. And the prince shall have a portion on both sides of the set-apart offerings and the citys portion; facing the set-apart offerings and the citys portion, extending westward on the west side and eastward on the east side, the length shall be alongside one of the portions, from the west border to the east border.

8. The land shall be his possession in Israel; and My rulers shall no more oppress My people, but they shall give the rest of the land to the house of Israel, according to their tribes.

9. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Enough, O rulers of Israel! Put away violence and plundering, execute justice and righteousness, and stop dispossessing My people, says the Lord Jehovah.

10. You shall have honest scales, an honest ephah, and an honest bath.

11. The ephah and the bath shall be of the same measure, so that the bath contains one-tenth of a homer, and the ephah one-tenth of a homer; their measure shall be according to the homer.

12. The shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, and fifteen shekels shall be your maneh.

13. This is the offering which you shall offer: one-sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat, and one-sixth of an ephah from a homer of barley.

14. The ordinance concerning oil, the bath of oil, is one-tenth of a bath from a kor. (A kor is a homer or ten baths, for ten baths are a homer.)

15. And one lamb shall be given from a flock of two hundred, from the watered land of Israel. These shall be for grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings, to make atonement for them, says the Lord Jehovah.

16. All the people of the land shall give this offering for the prince in Israel.

17. And it shall be the princes part to give burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings, at the feasts, the New Moons, the Sabbaths, and at all the appointed times of the house of Israel. He shall prepare the sin offering, the grain offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings to make atonement for the house of Israel.

18. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: In the first month, on the first day of the month, you shall take a young bull that is whole and cleanse the sanctuary.

19. And the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the house, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the gateposts of the inner court.

20. And thus you shall do on the seventh day of the month for everyone who goes astray and for him who sins in ignorance. Thus you shall make atonement for the house.

21. In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall observe the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.

22. And on that day the prince shall prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering.

23. And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to Jehovah, seven bulls and seven rams that are whole, daily for seven days, and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering.

24. And he shall prepare a grain offering of one ephah for each bull and one ephah for each ram, together with a hin of oil for each ephah.

25. In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, at the feast, he shall do likewise for seven days, according to the sin offering, the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the oil.

## Ezekiel 46

1. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: The gate of the inner court that faces toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the Sabbath it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.

2. And the prince shall enter by way of the porch of the gate from the outside, and stand by the gatepost. The priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings. He shall bow down at the threshold of the gate. Then he shall go out, but the gate shall not be shut until evening.

3. Likewise the people of the land shall bow down at the entrance to this gate before Jehovah on the Sabbaths and the new moons.

4. And the burnt offering that the prince offers to Jehovah on the Sabbath day shall be six lambs that are whole, and a ram that is whole;

5. and the grain offering shall be one ephah for a ram, and the grain offering for the lambs, as he shall be able to give, as well as a hin of oil with every ephah.

6. On the day of the new moon it shall be a young bull from the herd that is whole, six lambs, and a ram; they shall be ones that are whole.

7. And he shall prepare a grain offering of an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a ram, as he is able for the lambs, and a hin of oil with every ephah.

8. And when the prince enters, he shall go in by way of the porch of the gate, and go out the same way.

9. But when the people of the land come before Jehovah on the appointed feasts, whoever enters by way of the north gate to bow down shall go out by way of the south gate; and whoever enters by way of the south gate shall go out by way of the north gate. He shall not return by way of the gate through which he came, but shall go out through the opposite gate.

10. And the prince shall be in their midst. When they go in, he shall go in; and when they go out, he shall go out.

11. At the feasts and the appointed times the grain offering shall be an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a ram, as he is able to give for the lambs, and a hin of oil with every ephah.

12. Now when the prince makes a voluntary burnt offering or voluntary peace offering to Jehovah, the gate that faces toward the east shall then be opened to him; and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he did on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he goes out the gate shall be shut.

13. You shall daily make a burnt offering to Jehovah of a lamb of the first year that is whole; you shall prepare it morning by morning.

14. And you shall prepare a grain offering with it every morning, a sixth of an ephah, and a third of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour. This grain offering is a perpetual ordinance, to be made regularly to Jehovah.

15. Thus they shall prepare the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil, as a regular burnt offering every morning.

16. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: If the prince gives a gift of some of his inheritance to any of his sons, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance.

17. But if he gives a gift of some of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his until the year of liberty, after which it shall return to the prince. But his inheritance shall belong to his sons; it shall become theirs.

18. Moreover the prince shall not take any of the peoples inheritance by evicting them from their possession; he shall provide an inheritance for his sons from his own possession, so that none of My people may be scattered from his possession.

19. And He brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy rooms of the priests which face toward the north; and there was a place on the two sides westward.

20. And he said to me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the grain offering, so that they do not bring them out into the outer court to consecrate the people.

21. Then he brought me out to the outer court and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, at every corner of the court there was another court.

22. At the four corners of the court were enclosed courts, forty cubits long and thirty wide; all four corners were the same size.

23. There was a row of building stones all around in them, all around the four of them; and cooking hearths were made under the rows all around.

24. And he said to me, These are the kitchens where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifices of the people.

## Ezekiel 47

1. Then he brought me back to the entrance of the house; and there was water, flowing from under the threshold of the house toward the east, for the front of the house faces east; and the water was flowing from under the right side of the house, south of the altar.

2. He brought me out by way of the north gate, and led me around the outside to the outer gate that faces east; and there was water, running out on the right side.

3. And when the man went out to the east with the line in his hand, he measured one thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the water came up to the ankles.

4. Again he measured one thousand and brought me through the waters; the water came up to the knees. Again he measured one thousand and brought me through; the water came up to the waist.

5. Again he measured one thousand, and it was a river that I could not cross, for the water was too deep; water in which one must swim, a river that could not be crossed.

6. And he said to me, Son of man, have you seen this? And he brought me and returned me to the bank of the river.

7. When I returned, there, along the bank of the river, were very many trees on one side and the other.

8. Then he said to me: This water flows toward the eastern region, goes down into the wilderness, and enters the sea. When it reaches the sea, its waters are healed.

9. And it shall be that every living thing that swarms, wherever the rivers go, will live. There will be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters go there; for they will be healed, and everything will live wherever the river shall come.

10. It shall be that fishermen will stand by it from En Gedi to En Eglaim; they will be places for spreading their nets. Their fish will be of the same kinds as the fish of the Great Sea, exceedingly many.

11. But its swamps and marshes will not be healed; they will be given over to salt.

12. And along the banks of the river, on this side and that, will grow all kinds of trees used for food; their leaves will not wither, and their fruit will not fail. They will bear fruit every month, because their water flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing.

13. Thus says the Lord Jehovah: These are the borders by which you shall divide the land as an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have two portions.

14. And you shall inherit it equally with one another; for I raised My hand and swore to give it to your fathers, and this land shall fall to you as your inheritance.

15. And this shall be the border of the land on the north: from the Great Sea, by the road to Hethlon, as one goes to Zedad,

16. Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim (which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath), to Hazar Hatticon (which is on the border of Hauran).

17. Thus the boundary shall be from the Sea to Hazar Enan, the border of Damascus; and as for the north, northward, it is the border of Hamath. This is the north side.

18. And on the east side you shall mark out the border from between Hauran and Damascus, and between Gilead and the land of Israel, along the Jordan, and to the Eastern Sea. This is the east side.

19. And the south side, toward the south, shall be from Tamar to the waters of Meribah by Kadesh, along the brook to the Great Sea. This is the south side, toward the South.

20. And the west side shall be the Great Sea, from the southern boundary until one comes to a point opposite Hamath. This is the west side.

21. Thus you shall divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.

22. And it shall be that you will divide it by lot as an inheritance for yourselves, and for the strangers who sojourn among you and who bear children among you. They shall be to you as native-born among the children of Israel; they shall have an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.

23. And it shall be that in whatever tribe the stranger sojourns, there you shall give him his inheritance, declares the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 48

1. Now these are the names of the tribes: From the northern border along the road to Hethlon at the entrance of Hamath, to Hazar Enan, the border of Damascus northward, in the direction of Hamath, there shall be one portion for Dan from its east to its west side;

2. by the border of Dan, from the east side to the west, one portion for Asher;

3. by the border of Asher, from the east side to the west, one portion for Naphtali;

4. by the border of Naphtali, from the east side to the west, one portion for Manasseh;

5. by the border of Manasseh, from the east side to the west, one portion for Ephraim;

6. by the border of Ephraim, from the east side to the west, one portion for Reuben;

7. by the border of Reuben, from the east side to the west, one portion for Judah;

8. by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west, shall be the offering which you shall contribute, twenty-five thousand cubits in width, and in length the same as one of the other portions, from the east side to the west. And the sanctuary shall be in the middle of it.

9. The offering that you shall contribute unto Jehovah shall be twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in width.

10. And this holy offering shall belong to the priests; on the north twenty-five thousand cubits in length, on the west ten thousand in width, on the east ten thousand in width, and on the south twenty-five thousand in length. And the sanctuary of Jehovah shall be in the middle.

11. It shall be for the priests of the sons of Zadok, who are consecrated, who have kept My charge, who did not go astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.

12. And this contribution of land that is offered shall be to them a thing set apart, holy, by the border of the Levites.

13. And next to the border of the priests, the Levites shall have an area twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in width; its entire length shall be twenty-five thousand and its width ten thousand.

14. And they shall not sell or change any of it; nor pass through and take away the firstfruit of the land; for it is holy unto Jehovah.

15. And the five thousand cubits in width that remain, along the edge of the twenty-five thousand, shall be for common use by the city, for dwellings and suburbs. And the city shall be in the middle of it.

16. These shall be its measurements: the north side four thousand five hundred cubits, the south side four thousand five hundred, the east side four thousand five hundred, and the west side four thousand five hundred.

17. And the suburbs of the city shall be to the north two hundred and fifty cubits, to the south two hundred and fifty, to the east two hundred and fifty, and to the west two hundred and fifty.

18. And the rest of the length, alongside the offering of the holy portion, shall be ten thousand cubits to the east and ten thousand to the west. It shall be adjacent to the offering of the holy portion, and its produce shall be for food to those who work in the city.

19. And those who work in the city, from all the tribes of Israel, shall work it.

20. The entire offering shall be twenty-five thousand cubits by twenty-five thousand cubits, foursquare. You shall offer the holy offerings with the possession of the city.

21. The rest shall belong to the prince, on one side and on the other of the holy offering and of the citys possession, next to the twenty-five thousand cubits of the offering as far as the eastern border, and westward next to the twenty-five thousand as far as the western border, adjacent to the tribal portions; it shall belong to the prince. It shall be the holy offering, and the sanctuary of the house in the middle.

22. Moreover, from the possession of the Levites and the possession of the city which are in the midst of what belongs to the prince, the area between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin shall belong to the prince.

23. As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side to the west, Benjamin shall have one portion;

24. and by the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west, Simeon shall have one portion;

25. and by the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west, Issachar shall have one portion;

26. and by the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west, Zebulun shall have one portion;

27. and by the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the west, Gad shall have one portion;

28. and by the border of Gad, on the south side, toward the South, the border shall be from Tamar to the waters of Meribah by Kadesh, along the river to the Great Sea.

29. This is the land which you shall divide by lot as an inheritance among the tribes of Israel, and these are their portions, says the Lord Jehovah.

30. And these are the exits of the city. On the north side, measuring four thousand five hundred cubits

31. (the gates of the city shall be named after the tribes of Israel), the three gates northward: one gate for Reuben, one gate for Judah, and one gate for Levi;

32. and on the east side, four thousand five hundred cubits, three gates: one gate for Joseph, one gate for Benjamin, and one gate for Dan;

33. and on the south side, measuring four thousand five hundred cubits, three gates: one gate for Simeon, one gate for Issachar, and one gate for Zebulun;

34. and on the west side, four thousand five hundred cubits with their three gates: one gate for Gad, one gate for Asher, and one gate for Naphtali.

35. All the way around shall be eighteen thousand cubits; and the name of the city from that day shall be, JEHOVAH IS THERE.
