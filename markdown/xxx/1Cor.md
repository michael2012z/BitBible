# 1 Corinthians

## 1 Corinthians 1

1. Paul, appointed an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,

2. to the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all who in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:

3. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

4. I thank my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus,

5. that you were enriched in everything in Him in all utterance and all knowledge,

6. even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,

7. so that you are not lacking in any gift, patiently waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,

8. who will also confirm you to the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

9. God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

10. Now I exhort you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be completely fitted together in the same mind and in the same judgment.

11. For it has been declared to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of Chloes household, that there are contentions among you.

12. Now I say this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.

13. Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you immersed into the name of Paul?

14. I thank God that I immersed none of you except Crispus and Gaius,

15. that no one should say that I had immersed into my name.

16. Yes, I also immersed the household of Stephanas. Besides that, I do not know whether I immersed any others.

17. For Christ did not send me to immerse, but to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.

18. For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.

19. For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nothing the understanding of the intelligent.

20. Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?

21. For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who are believing.

22. For Jews request a sign, and Greeks seek after wisdom;

23. but we preach Christ crucified, truly to the Jews a stumbling block and to the Greeks foolishness,

24. but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.

25. Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.

26. For you see your calling, brethren, that there are not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many of nobility.

27. But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are mighty;

28. and the low-born of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things that are,

29. that no flesh should boast in His presence.

30. But out of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who was made for us from God wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption;

31. that, as it is written, He who exults, let him exult in the Lord.

## 1 Corinthians 2

1. And I, brethren, when I came to you, did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom declaring to you the Testimony of God.

2. For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.

3. I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.

4. And my speech and my preaching were not with enticing words of human wisdom, but in proof of the Spirit and of power,

5. that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.

6. However, we speak wisdom among those who are mature; but not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.

7. But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, having been hidden, which God appointed before the ages for our glory,

8. which none of the rulers of this age knew; for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.

9. But as it is written: Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it dawned upon the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love Him.

10. But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.

11. For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.

12. Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God.

13. These things we also speak, not in words which human wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.

14. But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he is not able to know them, because they are spiritually discerned.

15. But he who is spiritual discerns all things, yet he himself is discerned by no one.

16. For who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 3

1. And I, brethren, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual but as to carnal, even as to babes in Christ.

2. I fed you with milk and not with solid food; for until now you were not able, and even now you are still not able;

3. for you are still carnal. For where there are envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not carnal and behaving like men?

4. For when one says, I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos, are you not carnal?

5. Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers through whom you believe, as the Lord gave to each one?

6. I planted, Apollos watered, but God made it grow.

7. So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who causes growth.

8. Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor.

9. For we are Gods fellow workers; you are Gods field, Gods building.

10. According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it.

11. For no one is able to lay any other foundation than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.

12. Now if anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,

13. each ones work will be revealed; for the Day will declare it, because it will be disclosed by fire; and the fire will test each ones work, of what sort it is.

14. If anyones work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward.

15. If anyones work is consumed, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.

16. Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?

17. If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which you are.

18. Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become foolish that he may become wise.

19. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He catches the wise in their own craftiness;

20. and again, The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.

21. Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours:

22. whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or things present or things to come; all are yours.

23. And you are Christs, and Christ is Gods.

## 1 Corinthians 4

1. Let a man so consider us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.

2. Moreover it is required in stewards that one be found faithful.

3. But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by a human day in court. In fact, I do not even judge myself.

4. For I know nothing against myself, yet I am not justified by this; but He who judges me is the Lord.

5. Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the counsels of the hearts. Then each ones praise will be from God.

6. Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that you may learn in us not to think beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up one over the other.

7. For who makes you differ from another? And what do you have that you did not receive? Now if you did indeed receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?

8. You are already full. You are already rich. You have reigned as kings without us; and indeed I wish you truly did reign, that we also might reign with you.

9. For I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last, as men condemned to death; for we became spectacles to all creation, both to angels and to men.

10. We are foolish because of Christ, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are distinguished, but we are dishonored.

11. To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and we are poorly clothed, and beaten, and wander homeless.

12. And we labor, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;

13. being defamed, we entreat. We have become as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things until now.

14. I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I admonish you.

15. For though you might have countless instructors in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.

16. Therefore I urge you, be imitators of me.

17. For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church.

18. Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.

19. But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power.

20. For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power.

21. What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness?

## 1 Corinthians 5

1. Everywhere it is heard that there is sexual perversion among you, and such sexual perversion as is not even named among the Gentiles; that a man has his fathers wife.

2. And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he who has done this deed might be removed out from among your midst.

3. For indeed, as absent in body but present in spirit, I have already judged him who has so done this deed, as though I were present.

4. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, along with my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,

5. deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.

6. Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?

7. Therefore purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us.

8. Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

9. I wrote to you in my epistle not to keep company with sexually immoral people.

10. Yet I certainly did not mean with the sexually immoral people of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world.

11. But now I have written to you not to keep company with anyone named a brother, who is sexually immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; not even to eat with such a person.

12. For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside?

13. But those who are outside God judges. Therefore put away from among yourselves the evil person.

## 1 Corinthians 6

1. Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to court before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?

2. Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world will be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?

3. Do you not know that we shall judge angels? To say nothing of things that pertain to this life?

4. If then you have judgments concerning things pertaining to this life, you appoint those who are least esteemed by the church to judge.

5. I say this to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise person among you, not even one, who will be able to judge between his brethren?

6. But brother goes to court against brother, and that before unbelievers.

7. Now therefore, it is already an utter failure with you that you go to court against one another. Why do you not rather accept wrong? Why do you not rather be defrauded?

8. No, you yourselves do wrong and defraud, and these things to brethren.

9. Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be led astray. Neither prostitutes, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor sodomites,

10. nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.

11. And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.

12. All things are lawful for me, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be enslaved under the power of any.

13. Foods for the stomach and the stomach for foods, but God will destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for sexual perversion but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.

14. And God both raised up the Lord and will also raise us up through His power.

15. Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a harlot? Let it not be!

16. Or do you not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body? For the two, He says, shall become one flesh.

17. But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.

18. Flee sexual perversion. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.

19. Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?

20. For you were bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are Gods.

## 1 Corinthians 7

1. Now concerning the things of which you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.

2. Nevertheless, because of sexual perversion, let each have his own wife, and let each have her own husband.

3. Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her, and likewise also the wife to her husband.

4. The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.

5. Do not deprive one another except by agreement for a time, that you may be free for fasting and prayer; and come together again so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.

6. But I say this by permission, not by commandment.

7. For I wish that all men were even as myself. But each one has his own gift from God, one in this manner and another in that.

8. But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they remain even as I am;

9. but if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to be on fire.

10. Now to the married I command, yet not I but the Lord: A wife is not to leave her husband.

11. But, indeed, in case she does leave, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And a husband is not to send away his wife.

12. But to the rest I say, not the Lord: If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is willing to live with him, let him not send her away.

13. And a woman who has an unbelieving husband, if he is willing to live with her, let her not leave him.

14. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.

15. But if the unbeliever leaves, let them leave; a brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases. But God has called us in peace.

16. For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?

17. But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And so I command in all the churches.

18. Was anyone called while circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Was anyone called while uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised.

19. Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.

20. Let each one remain in the same calling in which he was called.

21. Were you called while a slave? Do not be concerned about it; but if you are able to be made free, rather use it.

22. For he who is called in the Lord while a slave is the Lords freedman. Likewise he who is called while free is Christs slave.

23. You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men.

24. Brethren, let each one remain with God however he was called.

25. Now concerning virgins: I have no commandment from the Lord; yet I give judgment as one who, having received mercy from the Lord, is faithful.

26. I suppose therefore that this is good because of the present necessity; that it is good for a man to be thus:

27. Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife.

28. But also if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such will have trouble in the flesh, but I am sparing you.

29. But this I say, brethren, the time has been shortened, so that even those who have wives should be as though they had none,

30. those who weep as though they did not weep, those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, those who buy as though they did not possess,

31. and those who use this world as not using it up. For the form of this world is passing away.

32. But I want you to be free from anxiety. He who is unmarried cares for the things of the Lord; how to please the Lord.

33. But he who is married cares about the things of the world; how to please his wife.

34. There is a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world; how to please her husband.

35. And this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a leash on you, but for what is proper, and that you may serve the Lord without distraction.

36. But if any man thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of youth, and it is the duty, let him do what he wishes. He does not sin; let him marry.

37. Nevertheless he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has control over his own will, and has so determined in his heart that he will keep himself a virgin, does well.

38. So then he who gives in marriage does well, but he who does not give in marriage does better.

39. A wife is bound by Law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband dies, she is at liberty to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord.

40. But she is happier if she remains so, according to my judgment; and I think I also have the Spirit of God.

## 1 Corinthians 8

1. Now concerning sacrifices to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.

2. And if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.

3. But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him.

4. Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God except one.

5. For even if there are so-called gods, whether in the heavens or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords),

6. yet for us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through Him.

7. However, there is not in everyone that knowledge; for some, with consciousness of the idol, until now eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.

8. But food does not commend us to God; for neither if we eat do we excel, nor if we do not eat are we lacking.

9. But beware lest somehow this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to those who are weak.

10. For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idols temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat things offered to idols?

11. And because of your knowledge the weak brother will perish, the one for whom Christ died.

12. But when you sin in this way against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.

13. Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat flesh, so that I not make my brother stumble.

## 1 Corinthians 9

1. Am I not an apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?

2. If I am not an apostle to others, yet at least I am to you. For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.

3. My defense to those who examine me is this:

4. Do we not have the right to eat and drink?

5. Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife, as do also the other apostles, the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?

6. Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no authority to not work?

7. Who ever serves military duty at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not drink of the milk of the flock?

8. Do I say these things only as a man? Or does not the Law say the same also?

9. For it is written in the Law of Moses, You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain. Is it oxen God is concerned about?

10. Or does He say it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written, that he who plows should plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should be partaker of his hope.

11. If we have sown spiritual things to you, is it a great thing if we reap your material things?

12. If others are partakers of this authority over you, should we not even more? Nevertheless we have not used this authority, but endure all things so that we might not hinder the gospel of Christ.

13. Do you not know that those who minister the holy things eat of the things of the temple, and those who serve at the altar partake of the altar?

14. Even so the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should live from the gospel.

15. But I have used none of these things, nor have I written these things that it should be done so with me; for it would be better for me to die than that anyone should make my exulting void.

16. For if I preach the gospel, there is no glory to me, for necessity is laid upon me; yes, woe is me if I do not preach the gospel.

17. For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if against my will, I have been entrusted with a stewardship.

18. What is my reward then? That when I preach the gospel, I may present the gospel of Christ without charge, that I may not abuse my authority in the gospel.

19. For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might gain the more;

20. and to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the Law, as under the Law, that I might gain those who are under the Law;

21. to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under the Law toward Christ), that I might gain those who are without law;

22. to the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I might in any way save some.

23. Now this I do through the gospel, that I may become a fellow partaker of it.

24. Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain it.

25. And everyone who competes for the prize controls himself in all things. Now they do it to obtain a perishable crown, but we an imperishable.

26. Therefore I run in this manner: not with uncertainty. Thus I fight: not as one who beats the air.

27. But I discipline my body and bring it into subjection, lest, when I have preached to others, I myself should become disqualified.

## 1 Corinthians 10

1. Moreover, brethren, I do not want you to be ignorant, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea,

2. and all were immersed into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,

3. and all ate the same spiritual food,

4. and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank out of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ.

5. But with most of them God was not well pleased, for they were scattered in the wilderness.

6. Now these things became examples for us, so that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted.

7. Neither become idolaters as were some of them. As it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.

8. Nor let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them prostituted, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell;

9. nor let us test Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed by serpents;

10. nor murmur, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer.

11. Now all these things happened to them as examples, and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.

12. Therefore let him who thinks he is firmly established take heed that he not fall.

13. No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also provide a way out, that you may be able to bear it.

14. Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.

15. I speak as to wise men; judge for yourselves what I say.

16. The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of Christ. The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ.

17. For we, though many, are one bread and one body; for we all partake of that one bread.

18. Observe Israel after the flesh: Are not those who eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?

19. What am I saying then? That an idol is anything, or what is offered to idols is anything?

20. Rather, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to have fellowship with demons.

21. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the Lords table and of the table of demons.

22. Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?

23. All things are lawful for me, but not all things are helpful; all things are lawful for me, but not all things build up.

24. Let no one seek his own, but each one the others well-being.

25. Eat whatever is sold in the meat market, not investigating because of conscience;

26. for the earth is the Lords, and all its fullness.

27. If any of those who do not believe invite you to dinner, and you desire to go, eat whatever is set before you, not questioning because of conscience.

28. But if anyone says to you, This was offered to idols, do not eat it for the sake of the one who informed you, and because of conscience; for the earth is the Lords, and all its fullness.

29. Conscience, I say, not your own, but that of the other. For why is my liberty judged by anothers conscience?

30. But if I partake by grace, why am I evil spoken of because of that for which I give thanks?

31. Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.

32. Do not become a cause of stumbling, either to the Jews or to the Greeks or to the church of God,

33. just as I also strive to please everyone in everything, not seeking my own profit, but of the many, in order that they may be saved.

## 1 Corinthians 11

1. Be imitators of me, just as I am also of Christ.

2. Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and keep the decrees just as I delivered them to you.

3. But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, the head of woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.

4. Every man praying or prophesying, having anything down over his head, dishonors his head.

5. But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled dishonors her head, for that is one and the same as if her head were shaven.

6. For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled.

7. For a man indeed ought not to veil his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man.

8. For man is not out of woman, but woman out of man.

9. Nor was man created through the woman, but woman through the man.

10. For this reason the woman ought to have authority on her head, because of the angels.

11. Nevertheless, neither is man without the woman, nor woman without the man, in the Lord.

12. For as woman is out of man, even so man also comes through woman; but all things are from God.

13. Judge among yourselves. Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head unveiled?

14. Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?

15. But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her in place of a wrap.

16. But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the churches of God.

17. Now in this that I command you, I do not praise you, since you come together not for the better but for the worse.

18. For first of all, I hear that when you come together as a church there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.

19. For there need to also be heresies among you, that those who are approved may be recognized among you.

20. Therefore when you come together in one place, it is not to eat the Lords Supper.

21. For in eating, each one takes his own supper ahead of others; and one is hungry and another is drunk.

22. What? Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise you.

23. For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread;

24. and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, Take, eat; this is My body which is broken on behalf of you; do this in remembrance of Me.

25. In the same manner He also took the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the New Covenant in My blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.

26. For as often as you may eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lords death until He comes.

27. Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.

28. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.

29. For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, not making a distinction regarding the Lords body.

30. For this reason many are weak and sick among you, and many have been put to death.

31. For if we would discern ourselves, we would not be judged.

32. But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.

33. Therefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.

34. But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, that you may not come together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order when I come.

## 1 Corinthians 12

1. Now concerning spiritual matters, brethren, I do not want you to be ignorant:

2. You know that you were Gentiles, led away regarding these mute idols, in whatever manner you were led.

3. Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed, and no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit.

4. There are different distributions of gifts, but the same Spirit.

5. And there are different distributions of ministries, but the same Lord.

6. And there are different distributions of works, but it is the same God who works each and every work.

7. But the manifestation is given through the Spirit to each one for the profit of all:

8. for to one is given a word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another a word of knowledge through the same Spirit,

9. to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the same Spirit,

10. to another works of power, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another tongues of nationalities, to another the interpretation of tongues.

11. But the one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills.

12. For as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ.

13. For by one Spirit we were all immersed into one body; whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free; and were all given to drink into one Spirit.

14. For also the body is not one member but many.

15. If the foot should say, Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?

16. And if the ear should say, Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?

17. If the whole body were an eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?

18. But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body just as He intended.

19. And if they were all one member, where would the body be?

20. But now indeed there are many members, but yet one body.

21. And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.

22. No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.

23. And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, we clothe them with greater honor; and our unpresentable parts have abundant elegance,

24. but our presentable parts have no need. But God composed the body, having given more abundant honor to that part which is lacking,

25. that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.

26. And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.

27. Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.

28. And God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, governings, tongues of nationalities.

29. Not everyone is an apostle are they? Not everyone is a prophet? Not everyone is a teacher? Not everyone is a worker of power?

30. Not everyone has gifts of healing? Not everyone speaks with tongues? Not everyone interprets?

31. But earnestly desire the more useful gifts. And yet I show you a way according to excellence.

## 1 Corinthians 13

1. If I were to speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become as sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.

2. And if I were to have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I were to have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.

3. And if I were to bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and if I were to give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.

4. Love is longsuffering and is kind; love does not envy; love does not boast itself, is not puffed up;

5. does not behave indecently, does not seek its own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil;

6. does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;

7. covers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

8. Love never fails. But if there are prophecies, they will come to an end; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will come to an end.

9. For we know in part and we prophesy in part.

10. But when the complete whole comes, then that which is in part will come to an end.

11. When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put an end to childish things.

12. For now we see through a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall fully know just as I also am fully known.

13. And now remain faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.

## 1 Corinthians 14

1. Pursue love, and be zealous over spiritual matters, but rather that you may prophesy.

2. For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God, for no one understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries.

3. But he who prophesies speaks to men for building up and exhortation and comfort.

4. He who speaks in a tongue builds himself up, but he who prophesies builds up the church.

5. I wish you all spoke with tongues, but rather that you prophesied; for he who prophesies is greater than he who speaks with tongues, unless indeed he interprets, that the church may receive building up.

6. But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by revelation, by knowledge, by prophesying, or by teaching?

7. Even things without life, whether flute or harp, when they make a sound, unless they present different musical notes, how will it be known what is piped or played?

8. For if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for battle?

9. So likewise you, if you do not utter by the tongue words easy to understand, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air.

10. There are, it may be, so many ethnic languages in the world, and none of them is without its own speech.

11. Therefore, if I do not know the dynamics of the language, I shall be a foreigner to him who speaks, and he who speaks will be a foreigner to me.

12. Even so you, since you are zealous for spiritual matters, seek to excel in the building up of the church.

13. Therefore let him who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.

14. For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.

15. What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the mind. I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the mind.

16. Otherwise, if you praise in the spirit, how will he who occupies the place set apart for the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, since he does not understand what you say?

17. For you indeed give thanks well, but the other is not built up.

18. I thank my God I speak with tongues more than every one of you;

19. yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, that I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.

20. Brethren, do not be children in understanding; however, in malice be infants, but in understanding be mature.

21. In the Law it is written: With men of other languages and other lips I will speak to this people; And yet, for all that, they will not hear Me, says the Lord.

22. Therefore tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophesying is not for unbelievers but for those who believe.

23. Therefore if the whole church comes together in one place, and everyone speaks in tongues, and there come in those who are unlearned or unbelievers, will they not say that you are not in your right minds?

24. But if everyone prophesies, and an unbeliever or an unlearned person comes in, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all.

25. And thus the secrets of his heart become revealed; and so, falling down on his face, he will do homage to God and proclaim that God is truly among you.

26. How is it then, brethren? Whenever you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.

27. If anyone speaks in a tongue, let there be two or at the most three, each in turn, and let one interpret.

28. But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in church, and let him speak to himself and to God.

29. Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others discern.

30. But if anything is revealed to another who sits by, let the first keep silent.

31. For you can each prophesy one by one, that everyone may learn and everyone may be encouraged.

32. And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.

33. For God is not of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.

34. Let your women keep silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but they are to be in subjection, as the Law also says.

35. And if they desire to learn something, let them question their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for women to speak in church.

36. Or did the Word of God go forth from you? Or did it come only to you?

37. If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.

38. But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.

39. Therefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak with tongues.

40. Let all things be done decently and in order.

## 1 Corinthians 15

1. Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand,

2. by which also you are being kept safe, if you hold fast that Word which I preached to you; unless you believe in vain.

3. For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,

4. and that He was buried, and that He was raised the third day according to the Scriptures,

5. and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.

6. After that He was seen by over five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until the present time, but some have fallen asleep.

7. After that He was seen by Jacob, then by each of the apostles.

8. Then last of all He was seen by me also, as by one of untimely birth.

9. For I am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

10. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than every one of them, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.

11. Therefore, whether it was I or they, so we preach and so you believe.

12. Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?

13. But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.

14. And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain and your faith is also vain.

15. Yes, and we are found to be false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He did not raise up; if in fact the dead are not raised.

16. For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised.

17. And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins.

18. Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.

19. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most pitiable.

20. But now Christ has been raised from the dead, and has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.

21. For since through man came death, through Man also came the resurrection of the dead.

22. For as in Adam everyone dies, even so in Christ everyone shall be made alive.

23. But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who are Christs at His coming.

24. Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God, even the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power.

25. For it is necessary for Him to reign till He has put every enemy under His feet.

26. The last enemy that will be destroyed is death.

27. For He has subjected everything under His feet. But when He says everything is subjected, it is evident that He who subjected everything under Him is exempt.

28. Now when everything is subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subjected to Him who subjected everything under Him, that God may be everything in all things.

29. Otherwise, what will they do who are immersed for the dead, if the dead are not truly raised? Why then are they immersed for the dead?

30. And why are we in danger every hour?

31. I affirm, by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die throughout the day.

32. If like other men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what profit is it to me, if the dead are not raised? Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!

33. Do not be led astray: Evil company corrupts good character.

34. Awake to righteousness, and do not sin; for some do not have the knowledge of God. I speak to your shame.

35. But someone will say, How are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come?

36. Foolish one, what you sow is not made alive unless it dies.

37. And what you sow, you do not sow the body that shall be, but mere grain; perhaps wheat or something else.

38. But God gives it a body as He purposed, and to each seed its own body.

39. Not every flesh is the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds.

40. There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies; but the brightness of the heavenly is one, and the brightness of the earthly is another.

41. There is one brightness of the sun, another brightness of the moon, and another brightness of the stars; for one star differs from another star in brightness.

42. So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption.

43. It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.

44. It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.

45. And so it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul; the last Adam a life-giving Spirit.

46. However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual.

47. The first man was out of the earth, of dust; the second Man is the Lord out of Heaven.

48. As is the man of dust, so also are those of dust; and as is the Man from Heaven, so also are those of Heaven.

49. And as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the Man of Heaven.

50. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood is not able to inherit the kingdom of God; nor does corruption inherit incorruption.

51. Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed;

52. in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

53. For this corruptible needs to put on incorruption, and this mortal needs to put on immortality.

54. So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory.

55. O Death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your victory?

56. The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the Law.

57. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

58. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

## 1 Corinthians 16

1. Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given orders to the churches of Galatia, so also you do:

2. On the first day of the week let each one of you lay something aside, storing up from whatever he is prospered, that there be no collections when I come.

3. And when I come, whomever you approve through letters I will send to carry your good will to Jerusalem.

4. But if it is fitting that I go also, they will go with me.

5. Now I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia (for I am passing through Macedonia).

6. And it may be that I will remain, or even spend the winter with you, that you may send me forward wherever I may go.

7. For I do not desire to see you now in passing; but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.

8. But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost.

9. For a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many opposing.

10. Now if Timothy comes, see that he may be with you without fear; for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do.

11. Therefore let no one despise him. But send him on his way in peace, that he may come to me; for I am waiting for him with the brethren.

12. Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brethren, but it was not at all his desire to come at this time; however, he will come when he has opportunity.

13. Watch, stand fast in the faith, be like men, be strong.

14. Let all that you do be done with love.

15. I encourage you, brethren; you know the household of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have appointed themselves to the ministry of the saints;

16. that you also submit to such, and to everyone who works and labors with us.

17. I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, for what was lacking on your part they supplied.

18. For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge such men.

19. The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.

20. All the brethren greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.

21. The salutation with my own hand, Paul.

22. If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. The Lord comes.

23. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

24. My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
