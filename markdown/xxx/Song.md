2. The Beloved: Like a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.

1. Shulamite: By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves; I sought him, but I did not find him.

2. I will rise now, and go about the city; in the streets and in the broad places I will seek him whom my soul loves. I sought him, but I did not find him.

3. The watchmen who go about the city found me and I said, Have you seen him whom my soul loves?

4. Scarcely had I passed by them, when I found him whom my soul loves. I took hold of him and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mothers house, and into the room of her who conceived me.

5. I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or by the does of the field, that you do not stir up nor awaken love until it pleases.

6. Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, I will go my way to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense.

7. You are all beautiful, my love, and there is no defect in you.

8. Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon. Look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions dens, from the mountains of the leopards.

2. Shulamite: I sleep, but my heart is awake; it is the sound of my beloved! He knocks, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my perfect one; for my head is covered with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.

5. I arose to open to my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh, on the handles of the lock.

1. The Beloved: How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O princes daughter! The curves of your thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a skilled artist.

3. Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.

4. Your neck is like an ivory tower, your eyes like the pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bath Rabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.

13. At our door all manner of excellent fragrances for love, new and old, I have treasured up for you, my beloved.

## Song of Songs 8

1. Oh, that you were like my brother, who nursed at my mothers breasts! If I should find you outside, I would kiss you; I would not be despised.

4. I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem: Do not stir up nor awaken love until it pleases.

6. Shulamite to Her Beloved: Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm; for love is as strong as death, jealousy as cruel as Sheol; its flames are flames of fire, a flame of YAH.

7. Many waters cannot quench love, nor can the rivers overflow it. If a man would give for love all the wealth of his house, it would be despised with contempt.

8. Relatives: We have a little sister, and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister in the day when she is spoken for?

9. If she is a wall, we will build upon her a battlement of silver; and if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.

10. Shulamite: I am a wall, and my breasts like towers; then I was in his eyes as one who found peace.

11. Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon; he leased the vineyard to keepers; everyone was to bring for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver.

13. The Beloved: You who dwell in the gardens, the companions listen for your voice; let me hear it!

14. Shulamite: Make haste, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices.
