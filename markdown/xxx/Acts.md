# Acts

## Acts 1

1. The former account I made, O Theophilus, of everything that Jesus began both to do and teach,

2. until the day in which He was taken up, after He through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom He had chosen,

3. to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many infallible proofs, being seen by them during forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.

4. And being assembled together with them, He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the Promise of the Father, which, He said, you have heard from Me;

5. for John truly immersed in water, but you shall be immersed in the Holy Spirit not many days from now.

6. Therefore, when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?

7. And He said to them, It is not yours to know times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority.

8. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit is come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.

9. Now when He had spoken these things, while they watched, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight.

10. And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel,

11. who also said, Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, who was taken up from you into Heaven, will so come in like manner as you have seen Him go into Heaven.

12. Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath days journey.

13. And when they had entered, they went up into the upper room where they were staying: Peter, Jacob, John, and Andrew; Philip and Thomas; Bartholomew and Matthew; Jacob of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot; and Judas of Jacob.

14. These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.

15. And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,

16. Men and brethren, this Scripture needed to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who took Jesus;

17. for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.

18. (Now this man procured a field out of the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails poured out.

19. And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akeldama; that is, Field of Blood.)

20. For it is written in the book of Psalms: Let his dwelling place become desolate, and let him not live in it; and, Let another take his office.

21. Therefore, of these men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,

22. beginning from the immersion of John until the day when He was taken up from us, it is necessary for one of these to become a witness with us of His resurrection.

23. And they proposed two: Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.

24. And they prayed and said, You, O Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which of these two You have chosen

25. to take part in this ministry and apostleship which Judas abandoned, that he might go to his own place.

26. And they cast their lots, and the lot fell on Matthias. And he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

## Acts 2

1. And when the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.

2. And suddenly there came a sound from Heaven, as being borne along by a rushing violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.

3. And there appeared to them tongues as of fire, being distributed, and it sat upon each one of them.

4. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.

5. And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.

6. And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together, and were bewildered, because everyone heard them speaking in his own dialect.

7. And they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, Behold, are not all these who speak Galileans?

8. And how is it that we hear, each in our own dialect in which we were born?

9. Parthians and Medes and Elamites, those dwelling in Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,

10. Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya adjoining Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,

11. Cretans and Arabs; we hear them speaking in our tongues the wonderful works of God.

12. So they were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, Whatever would this wish to be?

13. Others mocking said, They are full of sweet wine.

14. But Peter, standing up with the eleven, raised his voice and said to them, Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words.

15. For these are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day.

16. But this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:

17. And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, That I will pour out from My Spirit upon all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your young men shall see visions, your old men shall dream dreams.

18. And on My menservants and on My maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days; and they shall prophesy.

19. I will present wonders in the heavens above and signs in the earth beneath: blood and fire and vapor of smoke.

20. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.

21. And it shall come to pass that everyone who shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.

22. Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a Man approved by God to you by works of power, wonders, and signs which God did through Him in your midst, as you yourselves also know;

23. Him, being delivered by the determined purpose and foreknowledge of God, you have taken by lawless hands, have crucified, and put to death;

24. whom God raised up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for Him to be held by it.

25. For David says concerning Him: I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for He is at my right hand, that I not be shaken.

26. Therefore my heart rejoices, and my tongue is glad; moreover my flesh also dwells in hope.

27. For You will not leave My soul in Hades, nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.

28. You have made known to me the ways of life; You will make me full of joy in Your presence.

29. Men and brethren, let me speak freely to you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.

30. Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according to the flesh, He would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne;

31. he, foreseeing this, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that His soul was not left in Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption.

32. This Jesus, God has raised up, of which we are all witnesses.

33. Therefore being exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He poured out this which you now see and hear.

34. For David did not ascend into Heaven, but he says himself: The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand,

35. until I make Your enemies Your footstool.

36. Therefore let all the house of Israel understand with certainty that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.

37. Now when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?

38. Then Peter said to them, Repent, and let every one of you be immersed in the name of Jesus Christ to the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

39. For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call.

40. And with many other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, Be saved from this perverse generation.

41. Then those who gladly received his word were immersed; and that day about three thousand souls were added.

42. And they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers.

43. And fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs took place through the apostles.

44. Now all the believers were together, and had all things in common,

45. and sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to each person, as anyone had need.

46. So continuing day by day with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart,

47. praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved.

## Acts 3

1. Now Peter and John went up together to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.

2. And a certain man lame from his mothers womb was being carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms from those who entered the temple;

3. who, seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked for alms.

4. And fixing his eyes on him, with John, Peter said, Look at us.

5. So he gave them his attention, expecting to receive something from them.

6. Then Peter said, Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.

7. And he took him by the right hand and lifted him up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.

8. So he, leaping up, stood and walked and entered the temple with them; walking, leaping, and praising God.

9. And all the people saw him walking and praising God.

10. And they knew that it was he who sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.

11. And as the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch which is called Solomons, greatly amazed.

12. And when Peter saw it, he answered the people: Men of Israel, why do you marvel at this one? Or why do you gaze on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?

13. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified His Son Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had determined to set Him free.

14. But you denied the Holy and Just One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,

15. and killed the Prince of Life, whom God raised up from the dead, of which we are witnesses.

16. And His Name, by faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.

17. Yet now, brethren, I know that you did it in ignorance, as did also your rulers.

18. But those things which God foretold through the mouth of all His prophets, that the Christ would suffer, He has thus fulfilled.

19. Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,

20. and that He may send Jesus Christ, who was preached to you before,

21. whom Heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, of which God has spoken through the mouth of all His holy prophets since the past ages.

22. For Moses truly said to the fathers, The Lord your God will raise up to you a Prophet like me from among your brethren. You shall hear Him in all things, whatever He says to you.

23. And it shall be that every soul who will not hear that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.

24. Yes, and all the prophets, from Samuel and those who follow, as many as have spoken, have also foretold these days.

25. You are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in your Seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed.

26. Having raised up His Son Jesus, God sent Him to you first, to bless you in turning away every one of you from your iniquities.

## Acts 4

1. Now as they spoke to the people, the priests, the temple commander, and the Sadducees came near them,

2. being greatly disturbed that they taught the people and preached in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.

3. And they laid hands on them, and put them into custody until the next day, for it was already evening.

4. However, many of those who heard the Word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.

5. And it came to pass, on the next day, that their rulers, elders, and scribes,

6. as well as Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the family of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.

7. And standing them in the midst, they asked, By what sort of power or by what sort of name have you done this?

8. Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and elders of Israel:

9. If we this day are examined for a good deed done to an infirm man, by what means he has been made well,

10. let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in Him this man stands here before you whole.

11. This is the Stone which was counted as nothing by you builders, which has become the Head of the Corner.

12. Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under Heaven given among men that is required for us to be saved.

13. Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated and untrained men, they marveled. And they understood that they were with Jesus.

14. And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say against it.

15. But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,

16. saying, What shall we do to these men? For indeed, that a notable sign has been done through them is evident to all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we are not able to deny it.

17. But so that it spreads no further among the people, let us threaten them with a threat, that from now on they speak to no one in this name.

18. And they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.

19. But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, you judge.

20. For we are not able not to speak the things which we have seen and heard.

21. So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way of punishing them, because of the people, since they all glorified God for what had been done.

22. For the man was over forty years old on whom this sign of healing had been performed.

23. And being let go, they went to their own companions and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.

24. So when they heard that, they raised their voice to God with one accord and said: Lord, You are God, who made the heavens and earth and the sea, and all that is in them,

25. who by the mouth of Your servant David have said: Why did the nations rage, and the people devise vain things?

26. The kings of the earth took their stand, and the rulers themselves were gathered against the Lord and against His Christ.

27. For truly against Your holy Son Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together

28. to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose determined before to be done.

29. And now, Lord, look on their threats, and grant to Your servants to speak Your Word with all boldness,

30. by stretching out Your hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of Your holy Son Jesus.

31. And when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the Word of God with boldness.

32. Now the multitude of those believing were of one heart and one soul; neither did anyone say that any of the things he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common.

33. And with great power the apostles gave witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And great grace was upon them all.

34. Nor was there anyone needy among them; for all who were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,

35. and placed them at the apostles feet; and they distributed to each as anyone had need.

36. And Joses, who was surnamed Barnabas by the apostles (which is translated Son of Encouragement), a Levite of the country of Cyprus,

37. having land, sold it, and brought the money and placed it at the apostles feet.

## Acts 5

1. But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession.

2. And he kept back part of the proceeds, his wife also being aware of it, and brought a certain part and placed it at the apostles feet.

3. But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the proceeds of the land for yourself?

4. While it remained, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was it not in your own control? Why have you put this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.

5. Then Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and breathed his last. So great fear came upon all those who heard these things.

6. And the young men arose and wrapped him up, carried him out, and buried him.

7. Now it was about three hours later when his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.

8. And Peter answered her, Tell me whether you sold the land for so much? She said, Yes, for so much.

9. Then Peter said to her, How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.

10. Then immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. And the young men came in and found her dead, and carrying her out, buried her by her husband.

11. So great fear came upon all the church and upon all who heard these things.

12. And through the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people. And they were all with one accord in Solomons Porch.

13. Moreover none of the rest dared join them, but the people magnified them.

14. And more believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women,

15. so that they brought the sick out into the streets and laid them on beds and mattresses, that even if the shadow of Peter came passing by, it might overshadow some of them.

16. Also a multitude gathered from the surrounding cities to Jerusalem, bringing sick people and those who were tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all healed.

17. Then the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with zeal,

18. and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison.

19. But at night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said,

20. Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the Words of this Life.

21. And when they heard that, they entered the temple early in the morning and taught. But the high priest and those with him came and called the council together, with all the elders of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.

22. But when the officers came and did not find them in the prison, they returned and reported,

23. saying, Indeed we found the prison shut securely, and the guards standing outside before the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside.

24. Now when the high priest, the temple commander, and the chief priests heard these things, they were perplexed as to whatever would become of this.

25. Then one came and reported to them, saying, Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.

26. Then the commander went with the officers and brought them without violence, for they feared the people, that they might not be stoned.

27. And when they had brought them, they stood them before the council. And the high priest asked them,

28. saying, Did we not strictly command you not to teach in this name? And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this Mans blood upon us.

29. But Peter and the other apostles answered and said: We ought to obey God rather than men.

30. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you laid hands on, hanging Him on a tree.

31. Him God has exalted to His right hand to be Prince and Savior, to give to Israel repentance and remission of sins.

32. And we are His witnesses of these things, and so also is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him.

33. When they heard this, they were cut to the heart and took counsel to do away with them.

34. Then one in the council stood up, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the Law highly esteemed by all the people, and commanded them to put the apostles outside for a little while.

35. And he said to them: Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do regarding these men.

36. For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was slain, and all who obeyed him were scattered and came to nothing.

37. After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census, and drew away many people after him. He also perished, and all who obeyed him were dispersed.

38. And now I say to you, keep away from these men and let them alone; for if this counsel or this work is of men, it will come to nothing;

39. but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow it; lest you even be found to fight against God.

40. And they agreed with him, and when they had summoned the apostles and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.

41. So they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His name.

42. And daily in the temple, and in every house, they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus Christ.

## Acts 6

1. Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring against the Hebrews by the Hellenists, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily service.

2. Then the twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, It is not desirable that we should leave the Word of God and serve tables.

3. Therefore, brethren, seek out from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this need;

4. but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the Word.

5. And the saying pleased the whole multitude. And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch,

6. whom they set before the apostles; and when they had prayed, they laid hands on them.

7. And the Word of God grew, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were obedient to the faith.

8. And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.

9. Then there arose some from what is called the Synagogue of the Libertines (Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia), disputing with Stephen.

10. And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.

11. Then they secretly induced men to say, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.

12. And they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes; and they came upon him, seized him, and led him into the council.

13. They also set up false witnesses who said, This man does not cease to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the Law;

14. for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs which Moses delivered to us.

15. And all who sat in the council, gazing at him, saw his face as if it were the face of an angel.

## Acts 7

1. Then the high priest said, Tell us whether you hold thus to these things?

2. And he said, Brethren and fathers, listen: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,

3. and said to him, Get out of your country and from your relatives, and come to a land that I will show you.

4. Then he came out of the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt in Haran. And from there, when his father was dead, He moved him to this land in which you now dwell.

5. And God gave him no inheritance in it, not even enough to set his foot on. But even when Abraham had no child, He promised to give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him.

6. But God spoke in this way: that his seed would dwell in a foreign land, and that they would bring them into bondage and oppress them four hundred years.

7. And the nation to whom they will be in bondage I will judge, said God, and after that they shall come out and serve Me in this place.

8. And He gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so Abraham begot Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot the twelve patriarchs.

9. And the patriarchs, becoming envious, sold Joseph into Egypt. But God was with him

10. and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his household.

11. Now a famine and great distress came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and our fathers found no food.

12. But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.

13. And the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Josephs kindred became known to Pharaoh.

14. Then Joseph sent and called his father Jacob and all his relatives to him, seventy-five souls.

15. So Jacob went down into Egypt; and he died, he and our fathers.

16. And they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price of money from the sons of Hamor of Shechem.

17. But when the time of the promise drew near which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt

18. till another king arose who did not know Joseph.

19. This man dealt craftily with our people, and oppressed our forefathers, making them cast out their babies, so that they might not live.

20. At this time Moses was born, and was beautiful to God; and he was brought up in his fathers house for three months.

21. But when he was set out, Pharaohs daughter took him away and brought him up as her own son.

22. And Moses was trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and deeds.

23. Now when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to look after his brethren, the children of Israel.

24. And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended and avenged him who was oppressed, and struck down the Egyptian.

25. For he supposed that his brethren would have understood that God would deliver them by his hand, but they did not understand.

26. And the next day he appeared to two of them as they were fighting, and urged them to peace, saying, Men, you are brethren; why do you wrong one another?

27. But he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?

28. Do you not want to do away with me in the same way you did the Egyptian yesterday?

29. Then, at this saying, Moses fled and became an alien in the land of Midian, where he had two sons.

30. And when forty years had passed, the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire in a bush, in the wilderness of Mount Sinai.

31. When Moses saw it, he marveled at the sight; and as he drew near to observe, the voice of the Lord came to him,

32. I am the God of your fathers; the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses becoming terrified, dared not look.

33. Then the Lord said to him, Loosen the sandals from your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.

34. I have given attention to see the affliction of My people who are in Egypt; I have heard their groaning and have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.

35. This Moses whom they rejected, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? is the one God sent to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the Angel who appeared to him in the bush.

36. He led them out, after he had shown wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years.

37. This is that Moses who said to the children of Israel, The Lord your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your brethren. Him you shall hear.

38. This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the Angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers, the one who received the living Words to give to us,

39. whom our fathers did not desire to obey, but thrust him away. And in their hearts they turned back to Egypt,

40. saying to Aaron, Make us gods to go before us; as for this Moses who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.

41. And they made a calf in those days, led a sacrifice up to the idol, and made merry in the works of their own hands.

42. Then God turned and gave them over to serve the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the Prophets: Did you offer Me slaughtered animals and sacrifices during forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?

43. You also took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, images which you made to do homage; and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.

44. Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, as He appointed, instructing Moses to make it according to the pattern that he had seen,

45. which our fathers, having received it in turn, also brought with Joshua into the land possessed by the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers until the days of David,

46. who found favor before God and asked to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.

47. But Solomon built Him a house.

48. However, the Most High does not dwell in temples made with hands, as the prophet says:

49. Heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool. What house will you build for Me? says the Lord, or what is the place of My rest?

50. Has My hand not made all these things?

51. You stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always oppose the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so do you.

52. Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they, who received the Law by the command of angels and did not keep it, killed those who foretold the coming of the Just One,

53. of whom you now have become the betrayers and murderers.

54. When they heard these things they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed at him with their teeth.

55. But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into Heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God,

56. and said, Behold, I see the Heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.

57. Then they cried out with a loud voice, stopped their ears, and ran at him with one accord;

58. and they cast him out of the city and stoned him. And the witnesses laid aside their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul.

59. And they stoned Stephen as he was invoking and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.

60. And he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, Lord, do not charge them with this sin. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

## Acts 8

1. Now Saul was consenting to his death. At that time a great persecution arose against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.

2. And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.

3. As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering every house, dragging off men and women, committing them to prison.

4. Therefore those who were scattered went everywhere preaching the Word.

5. Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ to them.

6. And the multitudes with one accord heeded the things spoken by Philip, hearing and seeing the many signs which he did.

7. For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many who were possessed; and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed.

8. And there was great joy in that city.

9. But there was a certain man called Simon, who previously used sorcery in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, claiming that he was someone great,

10. to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.

11. And they heeded him because he had amazed them with his sorceries for a long time.

12. But when they believed Philip as he preached the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were immersed.

13. Then Simon himself also believed; and when he was immersed he continued with Philip, and was amazed, seeing the works of power and signs which were done.

14. Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the Word of God, they sent Peter and John to them,

15. who, when they had come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.

16. For as yet He had not fallen on any of them. They had only been immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus.

17. Then they laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.

18. And when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,

19. saying, Give me this authority also, that anyone on whom I lay hands may receive the Holy Spirit.

20. But Peter said to him, Your money perish with you, because you thought that the gift of God could be purchased with money!

21. You have neither part nor portion in this matter, for your heart is not upright before God.

22. Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.

23. For I see that you are in bitter wickedness and bound by unrighteousness.

24. Then Simon answered and said, Pray to the Lord for me, that none of the things which you have spoken may come upon me.

25. So when they had testified and preached the Word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.

26. Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise and go toward the south along the road which goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is desert.

27. So he arose and went. And behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of high office under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge of all her treasury, and had come to Jerusalem to do homage,

28. was returning. And sitting in his chariot, he was reading Isaiah the prophet.

29. Then the Spirit said to Philip, Go near and join yourself to this chariot.

30. So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, Do you understand what you are reading?

31. And he said, How can I, unless someone guides me? And he summoned Philip to come up and sit with him.

32. The place in the Scripture which he read was this: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, so He opened not His mouth.

33. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away, and who will declare His generation? For His life is taken from the earth.

34. So the eunuch answered Philip and said, I ask you, of whom does the prophet say this, of himself or of some other man?

35. Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him.

36. Now as they went down the road, they came upon some water. And the eunuch said, See, here is water. What prevents me from being immersed?

37. Then Philip said, If you believe with all your heart, it is lawful. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.

38. So he commanded the chariot to stand still. And both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he immersed him.

39. Now when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, so that the eunuch saw him no more; and he went on his way rejoicing.

40. But Philip was found at Azotus. And passing through, he preached in all the cities till he came to Caesarea.

## Acts 9

1. Then Saul, still breathing threats and murder toward the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest

2. and asked for letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, so that if he found any who were of the Way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.

3. But as he journeyed he came near Damascus, and suddenly a light shone around him from Heaven.

4. And he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?

5. And he said, Who are You, Sir? And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom you persecute. It is hard for you to kick against the goads.

6. So he, trembling and astonished, said, Lord, what do You have in mind for me to do? Then the Lord said to him, Arise and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.

7. And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a sound but seeing no one.

8. Then Saul was lifted up from the ground, and when his eyes were opened he saw no one. But they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.

9. And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.

10. Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and to him the Lord said in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, here I am, Lord.

11. So the Lord said to him, Arise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus, for behold, he prays.

12. And in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and putting his hand on him, so that he might receive his sight.

13. Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem.

14. And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind everyone who calls on Your name.

15. But the Lord said to him, Go, for he is a chosen vessel unto Me to bear My name before Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel.

16. For I will show him how many things he must suffer for My name.

17. And Ananias went his way and entered the house; and laying his hands on him he said, Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came, has sent me that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.

18. Immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he received his sight at once; and he arose and was immersed.

19. So when he had received food, he was strengthened. Then Saul spent some days with the disciples at Damascus.

20. And immediately he preached Christ in the synagogues, that He is the Son of God.

21. Then all who heard were amazed, and said, Is this not he who destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem, and has come here for that purpose, so that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?

22. But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt in Damascus, proving that this Jesus is the Christ.

23. Now after many days were past, the Jews plotted to do away with him.

24. But their plot became known to Saul. And they watched the gates day and night, to kill him.

25. Then the disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall in a basket.

26. And when Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to be joined to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, and did not believe that he was a disciple.

27. But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. And he described to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.

28. So he was with them at Jerusalem, coming in and going out.

29. And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and disputed with the Hellenists, but they attempted to kill him.

30. When the brethren found out, they led him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.

31. Then the churches throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace and were built up. And walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, they were multiplied.

32. Now it came to pass, as Peter went everywhere, that he also came down to the saints who dwelt in Lydda.

33. There he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden eight years and was paralyzed.

34. And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Arise and make your bed. Then he arose immediately.

35. So all who dwelt at Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.

36. At Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which is translated Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and charitable deeds which she did.

37. But it happened in those days that she became sick and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room.

38. And since Lydda was near Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him, begging him not to delay in coming to them.

39. Then Peter arose and went with them. When he had come, they brought him to the upper room. And all the widows stood by him weeping, showing the tunics and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them.

40. But Peter put them all out, and knelt down and prayed. And turning to the body he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up.

41. Then he gave her his hand and lifted her up; and when he had called the saints and widows, he presented her alive.

42. And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord.

43. So it was that he stayed many days in Joppa with Simon, a tanner.

## Acts 10

1. There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment,

2. a devout man and one who feared God with all his household, who gave alms generously to the people, and prayed to God always.

3. About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming in and saying to him, Cornelius.

4. And when he observed him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, lord? So he said to him, Your prayers and your alms have come up for a memorial before God.

5. Now send men to Joppa, and send for Simon whose surname is Peter.

6. He is lodging with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea. He will tell you what you need to do.

7. And when the angel who spoke to him had departed, Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier from among those who waited on him continually.

8. So when he had explained all these things to them, he sent them to Joppa.

9. The next day, as they went on their journey and drew near the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour.

10. And he became very hungry and wanted to eat; but while they made ready, he fell into a trance

11. and saw heaven opened and an object like a great sheet bound at the four corners, descending to him and let down to the earth.

12. In it were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air.

13. And a voice came to him, Arise, Peter; kill and eat.

14. But Peter said, By no means, Lord! For I have never eaten anything common or unclean.

15. And the voice spoke to him again the second time, What God has cleansed do not consider unclean.

16. This was done three times. And the object was taken up into heaven again.

17. Now while Peter was perplexed within himself what this vision which he had seen meant, behold, the men who had been sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simons house, and stood before the gate.

18. And they called and asked whether Simon, whose surname was Peter, was lodging there.

19. While Peter pondered concerning the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men are seeking you.

20. Arise therefore, go down and go with them without hesitating; for I have sent them.

21. Then Peter went down to the men who had been sent to him from Cornelius, and said, Behold, I am he whom you seek. For what reason are you here?

22. And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, one who fears God and has a good reputation among all the nation of the Jews, was divinely instructed by a holy angel to summon you to his house, and to hear words from you.

23. Then he invited them in and lodged them. And on the next day Peter went away with them, and some brethren from Joppa accompanied him.

24. And the following day they entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his relatives and close friends.

25. And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and did homage.

26. But Peter lifted him up, saying, Stand up; I myself am also a man.

27. And as he talked with him, he went in and found many who had come together.

28. Then he said to them, You know how unlawful it is for a Jewish man to keep company with or go to one of another nation. But God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.

29. Therefore I came without objection as soon as I was sent for. I ask, then, for what reason have you sent for me?

30. So Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,

31. and said, Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your alms are remembered in the sight of God.

32. Send therefore to Joppa and summon Simon, whose surname is Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea. When he comes, he will speak to you.

33. So I sent to you immediately, and you have done well to come. Now therefore, we are all present before God, to hear all the things commanded you by God.

34. Then Peter opened his mouth and said: In truth I perceive that God shows no partiality.

35. But in every nation whoever fears Him and works righteousness is acceptable to Him.

36. The Word which God sent to the children of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all);

37. that Word you know, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee after the immersion which John preached:

38. how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.

39. And we are witnesses of all things which He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem, whom they did away with, hanging Him on a tree.

40. God raised Him up on the third day, and gave to Him to become manifest,

41. not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before by God, even to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead.

42. And He commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is He who was ordained by God to be Judge of the living and the dead.

43. To Him all the prophets witness that, through His name, everyone believing into Him will receive remission of sins.

44. While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon each one who heard the Word.

45. And those of the circumcision who were believers, as many as came with Peter, were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had also been poured out on the Gentiles.

46. For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Then Peter answered,

47. Can anyone forbid water, that these should not be immersed, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?

48. And he commanded them to be immersed in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to stay a few days.

## Acts 11

1. Now the apostles and brethren who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the Word of God.

2. And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision contended with him,

3. saying, You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them!

4. But Peter explained it to them in order from the beginning, saying:

5. I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, an object descending like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came to me.

6. When I had fixed my eyes on it and considered, I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air.

7. And I heard a voice saying to me, Arise, Peter; kill and eat.

8. But I said, By no means, Lord, for nothing common or unclean has at any time entered into my mouth.

9. But the voice answered me again from Heaven, What God has cleansed do not consider unclean.

10. Now this was done three times, and the whole thing was drawn up again into heaven.

11. At that very moment, three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent to me from Caesarea.

12. Then the Spirit spoke to me to go with them without hesitating. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered the mans house.

13. And he told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house, who said to him, Send men to Joppa, and send for Simon whose surname is Peter,

14. who will tell you words by which you and all your household will be saved.

15. And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, as upon us at the beginning.

16. Then I remembered the Word of the Lord, how He said, John indeed immersed in water, but you shall be immersed in the Holy Spirit.

17. If therefore God gave them the same gift as He gave us who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to be able to prevent God?

18. When they heard these things they kept silent; and they glorified God, saying, Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance unto life.

19. Now those who were scattered after the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the Word to no one but the Jews only.

20. But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, preaching the Lord Jesus.

21. And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.

22. Then news of these things came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch.

23. When he came and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced, and encouraged them all that with purpose of heart they should continue with the Lord.

24. For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord.

25. Then Barnabas departed for Tarsus to seek Saul.

26. And when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for a whole year they assembled with the church and taught a great many people. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.

27. And in these days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.

28. Then one of them, named Agabus, stood up and gave a sign through the Spirit that there was going to be a great famine throughout all the world, which also happened in the days of Claudius Caesar.

29. Then the disciples, each according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brethren dwelling in Judea.

30. This they also did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.

## Acts 12

1. Now about that time Herod the king stretched out his hand to oppress some from the church.

2. And he killed Jacob the brother of John with the sword.

3. And because he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to seize Peter also. (And it was during the Days of Unleavened Bread.)

4. So when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after Passover.

5. Peter was therefore kept in prison, but constant prayer was offered to God for him by the church.

6. And when Herod was about to bring him out, that night Peter was sleeping, bound with two chains between two soldiers; and the guards before the door were keeping the prison.

7. And behold, the Angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the prison; and he struck Peter on the side and raised him up, saying, Arise quickly! And his chains fell off his hands.

8. Then the Angel said to him, Gird yourself and bind on your sandals; and he did so. And He said to him, Throw around your garment and follow Me.

9. So he went out and followed Him, and did not know that what was done through the Angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision.

10. When they were past the first and the second guard posts, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city, which opened to them of its own accord; and they went out and went down one street, and immediately the Angel departed from him.

11. And when Peter had come to himself, he said, Now I know for certain that the Lord has sent His Angel, and has rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the Jewish people.

12. So, when he had considered this, he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered together praying.

13. And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a girl named Rhoda came to listen.

14. And when she recognized Peters voice, because of her gladness she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter stood before the gate.

15. But they said to her, You are beside yourself. Yet she kept insisting that it was so. So they said, It is his angel.

16. But Peter continued knocking; and when they opened the door and saw him, they were amazed.

17. But motioning to them with his hand to keep silent, he told them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go, tell these things to Jacob and to the brethren. And he departed and went to another place.

18. Then, as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Peter.

19. And when Herod had searched for him and not found him, he examined the guards and commanded that they should be led away to death. And he went down from Judea to Caesarea, and stayed there.

20. Now Herod had been very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; but they came to him with one accord, and having made Blastus the kings personal aide their friend, they asked for peace, because their country was supplied with food by the kings country.

21. So on a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat on his platform and gave an oration to them.

22. And the people kept shouting, The voice of a god and not of a man!

23. And immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give glory to God. And he was eaten by worms and died.

24. But the Word of God grew and increased.

25. And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their service, and they also took with them John whose surname was Mark.

## Acts 13

1. Now in the church that was at Antioch there were certain prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.

2. As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.

3. Then, having fasted and prayed, and laid hands on them, they sent them away.

4. So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus.

5. And when they arrived in Salamis, they preached the Word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. They also had John as their assistant.

6. Now when they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew whose name was Bar-Jesus,

7. who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man called for Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the Word of God.

8. But Elymas the sorcerer (for so his name is translated) withstood them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.

9. Then Saul, who also is called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him

10. and said, O full of all deceit and all mischief, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease perverting the right ways of the Lord?

11. And now, lo, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a time. And immediately a dark mist fell on him, and he went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand.

12. Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had been done, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.

13. Now when Paul and his party set sail from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia; and John, departing from them, returned to Jerusalem.

14. But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat down.

15. And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Men and brethren, if you have any word of exhortation to the people, speak.

16. Then Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen:

17. The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He brought them out of it.

18. Now for a time of about forty years He put up with their ways in the wilderness.

19. And when He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He distributed their land to them by allotment.

20. After that He gave them judges for about four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.

21. And afterward they asked for a king; so God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.

22. And when He had removed him, He raised up for them David as king, to whom also He bore witness and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My own heart, who will do all My will.

23. From this mans seed, according to promise, God raised up for Israel a Savior, Jesus;

24. when John had first preached, before His coming on the scene, an immersion of repentance to all the people of Israel.

25. And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Who do you think I am? I am not He. But behold, there comes One after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to loose.

26. Men and brethren, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to you the Word of this salvation is sent.

27. For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they did not know Him, nor even the voices of the Prophets which are read every Sabbath, have fulfilled them in condemning Him.

28. And though they found no cause of death in Him, they asked Pilate that He should be done away with.

29. Now when they had fulfilled all that was written concerning Him, they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb.

30. But God raised Him from the dead.

31. He was seen for many days by those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are His witnesses to the people.

32. And we preach the gospel to you; the promise which was made to the fathers.

33. God has fulfilled this for us their children, in that He has raised up Jesus. As it is also written in the second Psalm: You are My Son, today I have begotten You.

34. And that He raised Him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, He has spoken thus: I will give you the holy and faithful promises of David.

35. Therefore He also says in another place: You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption.

36. For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell asleep, was buried with his fathers, and saw corruption;

37. but He whom God raised up saw no corruption.

38. Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through this One is preached to you the remission of sins;

39. and by Him everyone who believes is justified from all things from which you could not be justified by the Law of Moses.

40. Beware therefore, that what has been spoken in the Prophets may not come upon you:

41. Behold, you despisers, marvel and perish. For I work a work in your days, a work which you will by no means believe, though one were to declare it to you.

42. So when the Jews went out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath.

43. Now when the congregation had broken up, many of the Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.

44. And on the next Sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the Word of God.

45. But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy; and contradicting and blaspheming, they opposed the things spoken by Paul.

46. Then Paul and Barnabas grew bold and said, It was necessary that the Word of God should be spoken to you first; but since you thrust it away, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.

47. For thus the Lord has commanded us: I have set you as a light of the Gentiles, that you should be for salvation to the ends of the earth.

48. Now when the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and glorified the Word of the Lord. And as many as had been appointed unto eternal life believed.

49. And the Word of the Lord was carried throughout all the region.

50. But the Jews stirred up the devout and influential women and the chief men of the city, raised up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their borders.

51. But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.

52. And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.

## Acts 14

1. Now it happened in Iconium that they went together to the synagogue of the Jews, and spoke in such a manner that a great multitude both of the Jews and of the Greeks believed.

2. But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brethren.

3. Then, indeed, they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, Who was bearing witness to the Word of His grace, granting signs and wonders to be done through their hands.

4. But the multitude of the city was divided: and part were with the Jews, but part with the apostles.

5. And when a violent attempt was made by both the Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to inflict injury and stone them,

6. they became aware of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding region.

7. And they were preaching the gospel there.

8. And in Lystra a certain man without strength in his feet was sitting, a cripple from his mothers womb, who had never walked.

9. This man heard Paul speaking; who, observing him intently and seeing that he had faith to be saved,

10. said with a loud voice, Stand up straight on your feet! And he leaped and walked.

11. Now when the people saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices, saying in the Lycaonian language, The gods have come down to us, becoming like men!

12. And Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.

13. Then the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, determined to sacrifice with the multitudes.

14. But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard this, they tore their clothes and rushed in among the multitude, crying out

15. and saying, Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men with the same nature as you, and preach to you that you should turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and all things that are in them,

16. who in past generations allowed all nations to go in their own ways.

17. Nevertheless He did not leave Himself without witness, doing good, giving us rain from the heavens and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.

18. And with these sayings they could scarcely restrain the multitudes from sacrificing to them.

19. Then Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there; and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to have died.

20. However, when the disciples gathered around him, he rose up and went into the city. And the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.

21. And when they had preached the gospel to that city and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,

22. strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must enter the kingdom of God through many afflictions.

23. So when they had appointed elders in every church, and prayed with fasting, they committed them to the Lord into whom they believed.

24. And after they had passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.

25. And when they had preached the Word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.

26. From there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.

27. And when they had come and gathered the church together, they reported all that God had done with them, and that He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.

28. So they stayed there not a little time with the disciples.

## Acts 15

1. And certain men came down from Judea and taught the brethren, Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.

2. Therefore, when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and dispute with them, they appointed Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them to go up to Jerusalem, to the apostles and elders, concerning this question.

3. So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, relating the conversion of the Gentiles; and they brought great joy to all the brethren.

4. And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders; and they reported all things that God had done with them.

5. But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the Law of Moses.

6. And the apostles and elders came together to consider this matter.

7. And when there had been much dispute, Peter rose up and said to them: Men and brethren, you know that a good while ago God chose among us, that through my mouth the Gentiles should hear the Word of the gospel and believe.

8. So God, who knows the heart, acknowledged them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He did to us,

9. and made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.

10. Now therefore, why do you test God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?

11. But we believe through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ to be saved, in the same manner as they.

12. Then all the multitude kept silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul recounting how many signs and wonders God had worked through them among the Gentiles.

13. And after they had become silent, Jacob answered, saying, Men and brethren, listen to me:

14. Simon has declared how God at the first looked upon the Gentiles to take out of them a people for His name.

15. And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written:

16. After this I will return and will rebuild the tabernacle of David which has fallen down; I will rebuild its ruins, and I will set it up;

17. so that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles who are called by My name, says the Lord who does all these things.

18. Known to God from eternity are all His works.

19. Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those from among the Gentiles who are turning to God,

20. but that we write to them to abstain from pollutions of idols, from sexual perversion, from things strangled, and from blood.

21. For Moses has had throughout many generations those who preach him in every city, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.

22. Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas who was also named Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren.

23. They wrote this letter by them: The apostles, the elders, and the brethren, to the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: Greetings.

24. Since we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, You must be circumcised and keep the Law; to whom we gave no such commandment;

25. it seemed good to us, having become of one mind, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,

26. men who have given their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

27. We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who will also report the same things by word of mouth.

28. For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:

29. that you abstain from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual perversion. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.

30. So when they were sent away, they came to Antioch; and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.

31. When they had read it, they rejoiced over its encouragement.

32. And Judas and Silas, themselves being prophets also, exhorted and strengthened the brethren with many words.

33. And after they had stayed there for a time, they were sent back with greetings from the brethren to the apostles.

34. However, it seemed good to Silas to remain there.

35. Paul and Barnabas also remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the Word of the Lord, with many others also.

36. Then after some days Paul said to Barnabas, Let us now go back and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the Word of the Lord, and see how they are holding on.

37. Now Barnabas was determined to take with them John called Mark.

38. But Paul insisted that they should not take with them the one who had departed from them in Pamphylia, and had not gone with them to the work.

39. And the contention became so sharp that they parted from one another. And so Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus;

40. and Paul chose Silas and departed, being commended by the brethren to the grace of God.

41. And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.

## Acts 16

1. Then he came to Derbe and Lystra. And behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a certain Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was Greek.

2. He was well spoken of by the brethren who were at Lystra and Iconium.

3. Paul wanted to have him go on with him. And he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in that region, for they all knew that his father was Greek.

4. And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees to keep, which were determined by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem.

5. So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number day by day.

6. Now when they had gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the Word in Asia.

7. After they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit did not permit them.

8. So passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.

9. And a vision appeared to Paul during the night: A man of Macedonia stood and begged him, saying, Come over to Macedonia and help us.

10. And after he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them.

11. Therefore, sailing from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and the next day came to Neapolis,

12. and from there to Philippi, which is the principal city of that part of Macedonia, a colony. And we were staying in that city for some days.

13. And on the Sabbath day we went out of the city to the riverside, where prayer was customarily made; and we sat down and spoke to the women who assembled there.

14. And a certain woman named Lydia heard us. She was a seller of purple from the city of Thyatira, who revered God. The Lord opened her heart to heed the things spoken by Paul.

15. And when she and her household were immersed, she begged us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay. So she persuaded us.

16. And it happened, as we went to prayer, that a certain slave girl possessed with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much profit by fortunetelling.

17. This girl followed Paul and us, and cried out, saying, These men are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation.

18. And this she did for many days. But Paul, greatly disturbed, turned and said to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out that very instant.

19. But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to the rulers.

20. And they brought them to the magistrates, and said, These men, being Jews, exceedingly trouble our city;

21. and they proclaim customs which are not lawful for us to receive or observe, being Romans.

22. Then the multitude rose up against them; and the magistrates tore off their clothes and commanded them to be beaten with rods.

23. And when they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to keep them securely.

24. Having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.

25. And at midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.

26. And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyones bonds were loosened.

27. And the jailer, awaking from sleep and seeing the prison doors open, supposing the prisoners had fled, drew his sword and was about to kill himself.

28. But Paul called with a loud voice, saying, Do yourself no harm, for we are all here.

29. Then he called for a light, ran in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas.

30. And he brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?

31. So they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.

32. And they spoke the Word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.

33. And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes. And immediately he and all his family were immersed.

34. And when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them; and he rejoiced, believing in God with all his household.

35. And when it was day, the magistrates sent the floggers, saying, Let those men go.

36. So the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, The magistrates have sent to let you go. Now therefore depart, and go in peace.

37. But Paul said to them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, being Romans, and have thrown us into prison. And now do they drive us out secretly? No indeed! Let them come themselves and lead us out.

38. And the floggers told these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.

39. Then they came and begged them and brought them out, and asked them to depart out of the city.

40. So they went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they encouraged them and departed.

## Acts 17

1. Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.

2. And Paul, as his custom was, went in to them, and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures,

3. explaining and setting forth that the Christ needed to suffer and rise again from the dead, and that this Jesus whom I preach to you is the Christ.

4. And some of them were persuaded; and a great multitude of the devout Greeks, and not a few of the leading women, joined Paul and Silas.

5. But the Jews who were not persuaded, becoming envious, took some of the baser sort from the marketplace, and gathering a mob, set all the city in an uproar and came upon the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.

6. But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some brethren to the rulers of the city, crying out, These who have turned the world upside down have come here, too;

7. whom Jason has received, and these are all acting contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying there is another king, Jesus.

8. And they troubled the crowd and the rulers of the city when they heard these things.

9. So when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.

10. Then the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. When they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.

11. These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the Word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily, to see whether these things are so.

12. Therefore many of them believed, and also not a few of the Greeks, both prominent women and men.

13. But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the Word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came there also and stirred up the crowds.

14. Then immediately the brethren sent Paul away, to go as though toward the sea; but both Silas and Timothy remained there.

15. And those who conducted Paul brought him to Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him quickly, they departed.

16. Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him when he saw that the city was given over to idols.

17. Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout, and in the marketplace daily with those who happened to be there.

18. Then certain Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, What does this empty talker want to say? And others, He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign demons, because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.

19. And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine is, of which you speak?

20. For you are bringing some strange things to our ears. Therefore we want to know what these things mean.

21. For all the Athenians and the foreigners who were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing.

22. Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you fear the gods;

23. for as I was passing through and considering the objects of your devotion, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Therefore, the One to whom you show reverence without knowing, Him I proclaim to you:

24. God, who made the world and everything in it, since He is Lord of Heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands.

25. Nor is He served with mens hands, as though He needed anything, since He gives to all life, breath, and all things.

26. And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell everywhere on the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings,

27. so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us;

28. for in Him we live and move and exist, as also some of your own poets have said, For we are also His offspring.

29. Therefore, since we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine is like gold or silver or stone, something engraved by art and mans devising.

30. Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent,

31. because He has established a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has appointed. He has given assurance of this to everyone by raising Him from the dead.

32. And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some ridiculed, while others said, We will hear you again concerning this matter.

33. So Paul departed from their midst.

34. However, some men joined him and believed, among them Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.

## Acts 18

1. After these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth.

2. And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla (because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome); and he came to them.

3. And, because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them and worked; for by occupation they were tentmakers.

4. And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded both Jews and Greeks.

5. When Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.

6. But when they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook his garments and said to them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.

7. And he departed from there and entered the house of a certain man named Justus, one who revered God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.

8. Then Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his household. And many of the Corinthians, hearing and believing, were immersed.

9. Then the Lord spoke to Paul in the night by a vision, Do not be afraid, but speak, and do not keep silent;

10. for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you; for I have many people in this city.

11. And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the Word of God among them.

12. And when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat,

13. saying, This fellow persuades men to revere God contrary to the Law.

14. And when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrongdoing or wicked crimes, O Jews, there would be reason why I should bear with you.

15. But if it is a question of words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves; for I do not want to be a judge of such matters.

16. And he drove them from the judgment seat.

17. Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. But Gallio took no notice of these things.

18. So Paul still remained a good while. Then he took leave of the brethren and sailed for Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila were with him. He had his hair cut at Cenchrea, for he had a vow.

19. And he came to Ephesus, and left them there; but he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.

20. When they asked him to stay a longer time with them, he did not consent,

21. but took leave of them, saying, I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem; but I will return again to you, God willing. And he sailed from Ephesus.

22. And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up and greeted the church, he went down to Antioch.

23. After he had spent some time there, he departed and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.

24. Now a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.

25. This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things of the Lord, though he knew only the immersion of John.

26. So he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.

27. And when he was minded to cross to Achaia, the brethren wrote, encouraging the disciples to receive him; and when he arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace;

28. for he vigorously refuted the Jews publicly, showing through the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.

## Acts 19

1. And it happened, while Apollos was at Corinth, that Paul, having passed through the upper regions, came to Ephesus. And finding some disciples

2. he said to them, Since you believe, did you receive the Holy Spirit? And they said to him, We have not so much as heard whether there is a Holy Spirit.

3. So he said to them, Into what then were you immersed? And they said, Into Johns immersion.

4. Then Paul said, John indeed immersed with an immersion of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on Him who would come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.

5. When they heard this, they were immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus.

6. And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.

7. Now the men were about twelve in all.

8. And he went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading concerning the things of the kingdom of God.

9. But when some were hardened and did not obey, but spoke evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of a certain Tyrannus.

10. And this continued for two years, so that all who dwelt in Asia heard the Word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.

11. Now God worked unusual works of power through the hands of Paul,

12. so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were brought from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out from them.

13. Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists took it upon themselves to call the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, We command you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.

14. Also there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did so.

15. And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with; but who are you?

16. Then the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, overpowered them and subdued them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.

17. This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks dwelling in Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.

18. And many who had believed came confessing and telling their deeds.

19. Also, many of those who had practiced magic brought their books together and burned them in the sight of everyone. And they counted up the value of them, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.

20. So the Word of the Lord grew mightily and was powerful.

21. When these things were completed, Paul purposed in the Spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.

22. So he sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself stayed in Asia for a time.

23. And about that time there was no small disturbance about the Way;

24. for a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no small profit to the craftsmen.

25. He assembled them with the workers of similar occupation, and said: Men, you know that we have our wealth by this trade.

26. Moreover you see and hear that not only at Ephesus, but throughout almost all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are not gods which are made with hands.

27. So not only is this trade of ours in danger of falling into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be despised and her magnificence destroyed, whom all Asia and the world revere.

28. Now when they heard this, they were full of anger and cried out, saying, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!

29. So the whole city was filled with confusion, and rushed into the theater with one accord, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Pauls travel companions.

30. And when Paul wanted to go in to the people, the disciples would not allow him.

31. Then some of the officials of Asia, who were his friends, sent to him pleading that he would not venture into the theater.

32. Some therefore cried one thing and some another, for the assembly was confused, and most of them did not know why they had come together.

33. And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand, and wanted to make his defense to the people.

34. But when they found out that he was a Jew, all with one voice cried out for about two hours, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!

35. And when the city clerk had quieted the crowd, he said: Men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple guardian of the great goddess Artemis, and of the image which fell down from Zeus?

36. Therefore, since these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rashly.

37. For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess.

38. Therefore, if Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a case against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another.

39. But if you have any other inquiry to make, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.

40. For we are in danger of being accused of insurrection concerning today, there being no reason which we may give to account for this riot.

41. And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.

## Acts 20

1. After the uproar had ceased, Paul called the disciples to himself, embraced them, and departed to go to Macedonia.

2. Now when he had passed through that region and encouraged them with many words, he came to Greece

3. and stayed three months. And when the Jews plotted against him as he was about to sail to Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.

4. And Sopater of Berea accompanied him to Asia; also Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.

5. These men, going ahead, waited for us at Troas.

6. But we sailed away from Philippi after the Days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days came to them at Troas, where we stayed seven days.

7. Now on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul, ready to depart the next day, spoke to them and continued his message until midnight.

8. And there were many lamps in the upper room where they were gathered together.

9. And in a window sat a certain young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep. He was overcome by sleep; and as Paul continued speaking, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead.

10. But Paul went down, fell on him, and embracing him said, Do not be troubled, for his life is in him.

11. Now when he had come up, had broken bread and eaten, and talked a long while, even till daybreak, he departed.

12. And they brought the young man in alive, and they were not a little comforted.

13. Then we went ahead to the ship and sailed to Assos, there intending to take Paul on board; for so it was arranged, intending himself to go on foot.

14. And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene.

15. And we sailed from there, and the next day came opposite Chios. And the following day we arrived at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium. The next day we came to Miletus.

16. For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the Day of Pentecost.

17. So, from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church.

18. And when they had come to him, he said to them: You know, from the first day that I came to Asia, in what manner I lived among you all the time,

19. serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears and trials which happened to me by the plotting of the Jews;

20. how I kept back nothing that was helpful, but proclaimed it to you, and taught you publicly and from house to house,

21. testifying both to Jews, and also to Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.

22. And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will happen to me there,

23. except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.

24. But none of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.

25. And behold now, I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more.

26. Therefore I testify to you this day that I am blameless from the blood of everyone.

27. For I have not shrunk back from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.

28. Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood.

29. For I know this, that after my departure vicious wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.

30. Also from among yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after themselves.

31. Therefore watch, and remember that for three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears.

32. So now, brethren, I commend you to God and to the Word of His grace, which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.

33. I have coveted no ones silver or gold or apparel.

34. Yes, you yourselves know that these hands have served for my necessities, and for those who were with me.

35. I have shown you in everything, by laboring like this, that we need to support the weak. And remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.

36. And when he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.

37. Then they all wept greatly, and fell on Pauls neck and kissed him again and again,

38. sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they would see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.

## Acts 21

1. Now it came to pass, that when we had departed from them and set sail, running a straight course we came to Cos, the following day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.

2. And finding a ship sailing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.

3. When we had sighted Cyprus, we passed it on the left, sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload her cargo.

4. And finding disciples, we stayed there seven days. They told Paul through the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem.

5. And when we had come to the end of those days, we departed and went on our way; and they all accompanied us, with women and children, till we were out of the city. And we knelt down on the shore and prayed.

6. When we had taken our leave of one another, we boarded the ship, and they returned home.

7. And when we had finished our voyage from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, greeted the brethren, and stayed with them one day.

8. On the next day we who were Pauls companions departed and came to Caesarea, and entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.

9. Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.

10. And as we stayed many days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.

11. And when he had come to us, he took Pauls waistband, binding his own hands and feet, and said, Thus says the Holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this waistband, and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.

12. Now when we heard these things, both we and those from that place begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.

13. Then Paul answered, What do you mean by weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.

14. So when he would not be persuaded, we kept quiet, saying, The will of the Lord be done.

15. And after those days we packed and went up to Jerusalem.

16. Also some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us and brought with them Mnason, a certain Cypriot, one of the original disciples, with whom we were to lodge.

17. And when we had come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.

18. And on the following day Paul went in with us to Jacob, and all the elders were present.

19. And when he had greeted them, he related one by one the things which God had worked among the Gentiles through his ministry.

20. And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord. And they said to him, You see, brother, how many countless Jews there are who believe, and they also are all zealous for the Law;

21. but they have been informed about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children nor to walk according to the customs.

22. What then? The assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come.

23. Therefore do what we tell you: We have four men who have a vow.

24. Take them and be purified with them, and pay their expenses so that they may shave their heads, and that all may know that those things of which they were informed concerning you are nothing, but that you yourself also walk orderly and keep the Law.

25. But concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written and concluded that they should observe no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual perversion.

26. Then Paul took the men, and the next day, having been purified with them, entered the temple to declare the fulfillment of the days of purification, until an offering should be brought for each one of them.

27. Now when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him,

28. crying out, Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, the Law, and this place; and furthermore he also brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.

29. (For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)

30. And all the city was in a commotion; and the people ran together, seized Paul, and dragged him out of the temple; and immediately the doors were shut.

31. Now as they were seeking to kill him, news came to the commander of the garrison that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.

32. He immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. And when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.

33. Then the commander came near and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and he asked who he was and what he had done.

34. And some among the multitude cried one thing and some another. So when he could not ascertain the truth because of the tumult, he commanded him to be led away into the barracks.

35. And when he reached the stairs, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd.

36. For the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, Away with him!

37. Then as Paul was about to be led into the barracks, he said to the commander, May I speak to you? He replied, Do you speak Greek?

38. Are you not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up trouble and led the four thousand assassins out into the wilderness?

39. But Paul said, I am a Jew from Tarsus, in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city; and I ask you, allow me to speak to the people.

40. So when he had given him permission, Paul stood on the stairs and motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect, saying,

## Acts 22

1. Brethren and fathers, hear my defense before you now.

2. And when they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect, they kept all the more silent. Then he said:

3. I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, taught according to the strictness of our fathers Law, and was zealous toward God as you all are today.

4. I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women,

5. as also the high priest bears me witness, and all the council of the elders, from whom I also received letters to the brethren, and went to Damascus to bring even those who were there, bound, to Jerusalem to be punished.

6. Now it happened, as I journeyed and came near Damascus at about noon, suddenly a great light from Heaven shone around me.

7. And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?

8. So I answered, Who are You, Sir? And He said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.

9. And those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid, but they did not hear the words uttered by Him who spoke to me.

10. So I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all things which are appointed for you to do.

11. And since I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.

12. Then a certain Ananias, a devout man according to the Law, having a good testimony with all the Jews who dwelt there,

13. came to me; and he stood and said to me, Brother Saul, receive your sight. And at that same instant I looked up at him.

14. Then he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you that you should know His will, and see the Just One, and hear the voice out of His mouth.

15. For you will be His witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.

16. And now why are you waiting? Arise and be immersed, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.

17. And it happened, when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, that I was in a trance

18. and saw Him saying to me, Make haste and get out of Jerusalem quickly, for they will not receive your testimony concerning Me.

19. So I said, Lord, they know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those believing on You.

20. And when the blood of Your martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, consenting to his death, and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.

21. Then He said to me, Depart, for I will send you far from here to the Gentiles.

22. And they listened to him until this word, and then they raised their voices and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth, for he is not fit to live!

23. Then, as they cried out and tore off their clothes and threw dust into the air,

24. the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and said that he should be examined by scourging, so that he might know for what reason they shouted so against him.

25. And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and not condemned by trial?

26. When the centurion heard that, he went and told the commander, saying, Take heed what you are about to do, for this man is a Roman.

27. Then the commander came and said to him, Tell me, are you a Roman? He said, Yes.

28. And the commander answered, With a large sum I obtained this citizenship. And Paul said, But I was free born.

29. Then immediately those who were about to examine him stood away from him; and the commander was also afraid after he fully knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.

30. The next day, because he wanted to know for certain why he was accused by the Jews, he released him from his bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down and set him before them.

## Acts 23

1. Then Paul, looking earnestly at the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.

2. And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.

3. Then Paul said to him, God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! For you sit to judge me according to the Law, and do you command me to be struck contrary to the Law?

4. And those who stood by said, Do you revile Gods high priest?

5. Then Paul said, I did not know, brethren, that he was the high priest; for it is written, You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.

6. But when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!

7. And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the multitude was divided.

8. For Sadducees say that there is no resurrection; and no angel or spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.

9. Then there arose a loud outcry. And the scribes of the Pharisees party arose and protested, saying, We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.

10. And when there arose a great dissension, the commander, fearing lest Paul might be pulled to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the barracks.

11. But the following night the Lord stood by him and said, Be of good courage, Paul; for as you have testified of Me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness at Rome.

12. And when it was day, some of the Jews made a pact and bound themselves under an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they should kill Paul.

13. And there were more than forty who made this conspiracy.

14. And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great oath that we will eat nothing until we have killed Paul.

15. Now you, therefore, together with the council, communicate to the commander that he be brought down to you tomorrow, as though you were going to make more specific inquiries concerning him; and we are ready to kill him before he comes near.

16. So when Pauls sisters son heard of their ambush, he went and entered the barracks and told Paul.

17. Then Paul called one of the centurions to him and said, Lead this young man to the commander, for he has something to tell him.

18. So he took him and brought him to the commander and said, Paul the prisoner called me to him and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to say to you.

19. Then the commander took him by the hand, went aside and asked privately, What is it that you have to tell me?

20. And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask that you bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to make more specific inquiries about him.

21. But do not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of them lie in wait for him, men who have bound themselves by an oath that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him; and now they are ready, waiting for the promise from you.

22. So the commander let the young man depart, and commanded him, Tell no one that you have disclosed these things to me.

23. And he summoned two centurions, saying, Prepare two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at the third hour of the night;

24. and provide mounts to set Paul on, and bring him safely to Felix the governor.

25. And he wrote a letter in the following manner:

26. Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings.

27. This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them. Coming with the troops I rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.

28. And when I wanted to know the reason they accused him, I brought him before their council.

29. I found out that he was accused concerning questions of their law, but had nothing charged against him deserving of death or bonds.

30. And when it was disclosed to me that the Jews were about to carry out a plot against the man, I sent him immediately to you, and also commanded his accusers to state before you the charges against him. Farewell.

31. Then the soldiers, as they were commanded, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.

32. The next day they left the horsemen to go on with him, and returned to the barracks.

33. When they came to Caesarea and had delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.

34. And when the governor had read it, he asked what province he was from. And when he understood that he was from Cilicia,

35. he said, I will fully hear you when your accusers also have come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herods Praetorium.

## Acts 24

1. And after five days Ananias the high priest came down with the elders and a certain orator named Tertullus. These made declarations to the governor against Paul.

2. And when he was called upon, Tertullus began his accusation, saying: Seeing that through you we enjoy great peace, and prosperity is being brought to this nation by your providence,

3. we accept it always and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.

4. Nevertheless, not to be tedious to you any further, I entreat you to hear, by your fairness, a few words from us.

5. For we have found this man pestilent, a mover of insurrection among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.

6. He even tried to profane the temple, and we seized him, and were determined to judge him according to our law.

7. But the commander Lysias came by and with great violence took him out of our hands,

8. commanding his accusers to come to you. By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.

9. And the Jews also assented, alleging that these things were so.

10. Then Paul, after the governor had nodded to him to speak, answered: Inasmuch as I know that you have been for many years a judge of this nation, I do the more cheerfully make my defense,

11. because you may ascertain that it is no more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to do homage.

12. And they neither found me in the temple disputing with anyone nor inciting the crowd, neither in the synagogues nor throughout the city.

13. Nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.

14. But this I confess to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect, so I serve the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and in the Prophets.

15. I have hope in God, which they themselves also admit, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and the unjust.

16. This being so, I myself always strive to have a conscience that is blameless toward God and men.

17. Now after many years I came to bring alms and offerings to my nation,

18. in the midst of which some Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with a crowd nor with tumult.

19. They ought to have been here before you to accuse if they had anything against me.

20. Or else let these themselves say if they found any wrongdoing in me while I stood before the council,

21. unless it is for this one statement which I cried out while standing among them, Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged by you this day.

22. And when Felix heard these things, having more accurate knowledge of the Way, he postponed judgment and said, When Lysias the commander comes down, I will examine your case.

23. So he commanded the centurion to keep Paul and to let him have liberty, and told him not to forbid any of his friends to provide for or visit him.

24. And after some days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.

25. Now as he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix became afraid and answered, Go away for now; when I have a convenient time I will call for you.

26. Meanwhile he also hoped that money would be given him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore he sent for him more often and conversed with him.

27. But after two years Porcius Festus succeeded Felix; and Felix, wanting to do the Jews a favor, left Paul bound.

## Acts 25

1. Now when Festus had come to the province, after three days he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.

2. Then the high priest and the chief men of the Jews made a statement to him against Paul; and they petitioned him,

3. asking a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem; while they lay in ambush along the road to kill him.

4. But Festus answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself was going there shortly.

5. Therefore, he said, let those who have authority among you go down with me and accuse this man, whatever there might be in him.

6. And when he had remained among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea. And the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, he commanded Paul to be brought.

7. And when he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around and brought many serious complaints against Paul, which they were not able to prove.

8. Defending himself he said, Neither against the Law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I trespassed in anything at all.

9. But Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favor, answered Paul and said, Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and there be judged before me concerning these things?

10. Then Paul said, I stand at Caesars judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you very well know.

11. For if I have done wrong, or have committed anything deserving of death, I do not refuse to die; but if there is nothing in these things of which these men accuse me, no one can deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar.

12. Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, You have appealed to Caesar? To Caesar you shall go.

13. And after some days King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus.

14. And when they had been there many days, Festus set forth Pauls case before the king, saying: There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix,

15. about whom the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, when I was in Jerusalem, asking for a judgment against him.

16. To them I answered, It is not the custom of the Romans to deliver any man to destruction before the accused meets the accusers face to face, and has opportunity to make a defense concerning the charge against him.

17. Therefore when they had come together, without any delay, the next day I sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought in.

18. When the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation against him of such things as I supposed,

19. but had some questions against him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who had died, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.

20. And because I was uncertain of such questions, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters.

21. But when Paul appealed to be reserved for the decision of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I could send him to Caesar.

22. Then Agrippa said to Festus, I also would like to hear the man myself. Tomorrow, he said, you shall hear him.

23. So the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp, and had entered the auditorium with the commanders and the prominent men of the city, at Festus command Paul was led out.

24. And Festus said: King Agrippa and all the men who are here present with us, you see this man about whom the whole assembly of the Jews petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying out that he was not fit to live any longer.

25. But when I found that he had committed nothing deserving of death, and that he himself had appealed to Augustus, I decided to send him.

26. But I have nothing certain to write to my lord concerning him. Therefore I have brought him out before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the examination has taken place I may have something to write.

27. For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner and not to specify the charges against him.

## Acts 26

1. Then Agrippa said to Paul, You are permitted to speak for yourself. So Paul stretched out his hand and answered for himself:

2. I think myself happy, King Agrippa, because today I shall give a defense before you concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews,

3. especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which have to do with the Jews. Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.

4. My manner of life from my youth, which was spent from the beginning among my own nation at Jerusalem, all the Jews know.

5. They knew me from the first, if they were willing to bear witness, that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.

6. And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers.

7. To this promise our twelve tribes, earnestly serving God night and day, hope to attain. Concerning this hope, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.

8. Why should it be thought incredible by you if God raises the dead?

9. Indeed, I myself thought I must do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.

10. This I also did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.

11. And I punished them often in every synagogue and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.

12. While thus occupied, as I journeyed to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,

13. at midday, O king, along the road I saw a light from Heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me.

14. And when we all had fallen to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.

15. So I said, Who are You, Sir? And He said, I am Jesus, whom you persecute.

16. But arise and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you a minister and a witness both of the things which you have seen and of the things in which I will appear to you.

17. I will deliver you from the Jewish people, as well as from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you,

18. to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light, and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in Me.

19. Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the Heavenly vision,

20. but declared first to those in Damascus and in Jerusalem, and throughout all the region of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent, turn to God, and do works befitting repentance.

21. For these reasons the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.

22. Therefore, having obtained help from God, to this day I stand, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things than those which the prophets and Moses said would come to be;

23. that the Christ would suffer, that He would be the first to rise from the dead, and would proclaim light to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles.

24. Now as he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you are beside yourself! Much learning is driving you mad!

25. But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak the words of truth and sobriety.

26. For the king, before whom I also speak freely, knows these things; for I am convinced that none of these things are hidden from him, since this thing was not done in a corner.

27. King Agrippa, do you believe the Prophets? I know that you believe.

28. Then Agrippa said to Paul, You almost persuade me to become a Christian.

29. And Paul said, I would to God that not only you, but also all who hear me today, might become both almost and altogether such as I am, except for these bonds.

30. When he had said these things, the king stood up, as well as the governor and Bernice and those who sat with them;

31. and when they had gone aside, they talked among themselves, saying, This man is doing nothing deserving of death or bonds.

32. Then Agrippa said to Festus, This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.

## Acts 27

1. And when it was decided that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to one named Julius, a centurion of the Augustan Regiment.

2. So, boarding a ship of Adramyttium, we put to sea, meaning to sail along the coasts of Asia. Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with us.

3. And the next day we landed at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul kindly and gave him liberty to go to his friends and receive care.

4. And when we had set sail from there, we sailed under the shelter of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.

5. And when we had sailed over the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra of Lycia.

6. There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, and he put us on it.

7. And when we had sailed slowly many days, and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, the wind not permitting us to proceed, we sailed under the shelter of Crete off Salmone.

8. And passing it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.

9. Now when much time had been spent, and sailing was now dangerous because the fast was already past, Paul exhorted them,

10. saying, Men, I perceive that this voyage will end with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and ship, but also our lives.

11. Nevertheless the centurion was more persuaded by the helmsman and the owner of the ship than by the things spoken by Paul.

12. And because the harbor was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised to set sail from there also, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete opening toward the southwest and northwest, and winter there.

13. And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, raising anchor, they sailed close by Crete.

14. But not long after, a tempestuous wind arose, called Euroclydon.

15. So when the ship was caught, and could not head into the wind, we let her be carried along.

16. And running under the shelter of an island called Clauda, we secured the boat with difficulty.

17. When they had taken it on board, they used cables to undergird the ship; and fearing lest they should run aground on the quicksands, they struck sail and so were driven.

18. And because we were exceedingly tempest-tossed, the next day they lightened the ship.

19. On the third day we threw the ships tackle overboard with our own hands.

20. Now when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest beat on us, all hope that we would be saved was then taken away.

21. But after long abstinence from food, then Paul stood in the midst of them and said, Men, you should have heeded me, and not have sailed from Crete and incurred this injury and loss.

22. And now I urge you to be of good cheer, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.

23. For there stood by me this night an angel of God, to whom I belong and whom I serve,

24. saying, Do not be afraid, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar; and indeed God has granted you all those who sail with you.

25. Therefore be of good cheer, men, for I believe God, that it will be just as it was told me.

26. However, we must fall on a certain island.

27. Now when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors sensed that they were drawing near some land.

28. And they took soundings and found it to be twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little farther, they took soundings again and found it to be fifteen fathoms.

29. Then, fearing lest we should run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern, and wished for day to come.

30. And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under pretense of putting out anchors from the prow,

31. Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these men remain in the ship, you cannot be saved.

32. Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat and let it fall off.

33. And as day was about to dawn, Paul begged them all to take food, saying, Today is the fourteenth day you have waited and continued without food, and eaten nothing.

34. Therefore I urge you to take nourishment, for this is for your survival, because not a hair will fall from the head of any of you.

35. And when he had said these things, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of them all; and when he had broken it he began to eat.

36. Then they all became more encouraged, and also took food themselves.

37. And in all we were two hundred and seventy-six souls on the ship.

38. So when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship and threw out the wheat into the sea.

39. And when it was day, they did not recognize the land; but they observed a certain bay with a beach, onto which they purposed to run the ship if they were able.

40. And they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, meanwhile loosing the rudder bands; and they hoisted the mainsail to the wind and made for shore.

41. But striking a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the prow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was being broken up by the violence of the waves.

42. And the soldiers purpose was to kill the prisoners, that not any of them should swim away and escape.

43. But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, kept them from their purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should jump overboard first and get to land;

44. and for the rest to go, some on boards and some on parts of the ship. And so it was that they all escaped safely to land.

## Acts 28

1. And when they had escaped, they then found out that the island was called Melita.

2. And the natives showed us unusual kindness; for they kindled a fire and made us all welcome, because of the rain that was falling and because of the cold.

3. But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and fastened on his hand.

4. So when the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet justice does not allow to live.

5. But he shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm.

6. However, they were expecting that he would swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after they had looked for a long time and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.

7. In that region there were lands of the chief of the island, whose name was Publius, who received us and lodged us for three days hospitably.

8. And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and dysentery. Paul went in to him and prayed, and he laid his hands on him and healed him.

9. So when this was done, the rest of those on the island who had diseases also came and were healed.

10. They also honored us with many honors; and when we departed, they provided such things as were necessary.

11. After three months we sailed in an Alexandrian ship whose figurehead was the Twin Brothers, which had wintered at the island.

12. And landing at Syracuse, we stayed three days.

13. From there we circled round and came to Rhegium. And after one day the south wind blew; and the next day we came to Puteoli,

14. where we found brethren, and were entreated to stay with them seven days. And thus we went toward Rome.

15. And from there, when the brethren heard about us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.

16. And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard; but Paul was permitted to dwell by himself with the soldier who guarded him.

17. And it came to pass after three days that Paul called those being chief of the Jews together. So when they had come together, he said to them: Men and brethren, though I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,

18. who, when they had examined me, wanted to let me go, because there was no cause for putting me to death.

19. But when the Jews spoke against it, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything of which to accuse my nation.

20. For this reason therefore I have called for you, to see you and speak with you, because for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.

21. Then they said to him, We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brethren who came reported or spoken any evil of you.

22. But we desire to hear from you what you think; for concerning this sect, we know that it is spoken against everywhere.

23. So when they had appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging, to whom he explained and testified of the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets, from morning till evening.

24. And some were persuaded by the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.

25. So when they did not agree among themselves, they were dismissed after Paul had said one word: The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,

26. saying, Go to this people and say: Hearing you will hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you will see, and not perceive;

27. for the heart of this people has grown dull. Their ears are hard of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, that they should not see with their eyes nor hear with their ears, that they should not understand with their hearts and turn, and I should heal them.

28. Therefore let it be known to you that the salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it!

29. And when he had said these words, the Jews departed and had much discussion among themselves.

30. And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who came to him,

31. preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence, without hindrance.
