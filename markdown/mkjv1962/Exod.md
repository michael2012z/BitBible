# Exodus

## Exodus 1

1. And these [were] the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt. Every man and his household came with Jacob:

2. Reuben; Simeon; Levi; and Judah;

3. Issachar; Zebulun; and Benjamin,

4. Dan; and Naphtali; Gad; and Asher.

5. And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls, for Joseph was [already] in Egypt.

6. And Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation.

7. And the sons of Israel were fruitful, and increased very much, and multiplied, and became exceedingly mighty. And the land was filled [with] them.

8. And there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.

9. And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the sons of Israel [are] many and mightier than we.

10. Come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it will be when there comes a war, they join also to our enemies, and fight against us, and get out of the land.

11. And they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. And they built treasure cities for Pharaoh, Pithon and Raamses.

12. But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the sons of Israel.

13. And the Egyptians made the sons of Israel serve with harshness.

14. And they made their lives bitter with hard work in mortar and in bricks, and in all [kinds of] work in the field; all their work in which they made them do [was] with harshness.

15. And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one [was] Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah.

16. And he said, When you midwife the Hebrew women, and look on the birth stools, if it [is] a son, then you shall kill him. But if it [is] a daughter, then she shall live.

17. But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved alive the male children.

18. And the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, Why have you done this thing, and have saved the male children alive?

19. And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women [are] not like the Egyptian women. For they [are] lively, and are delivered before the midwives come in to them.

20. And God dealt well with the midwives. And the people multiplied and became very mighty.

21. And it happened, because the midwives feared God, [that] He made them houses.

22. And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born you shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.

## Exodus 2

1. And a man went from the house of Levi and took a daughter of Levi [as his wife].

2. And the woman conceived and bore a son. And when she saw him, that he was beautiful, she hid him three months.

3. But when she could no longer hide him, she took an ark of papyrus for him, and daubed it with bitumen and with pitch, and put the child in it. And she laid [it] in the reeds by the river's edge.

4. And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.

5. And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river. And her maidens walked along by the riverside. And when she saw the ark among the reeds, she sent her slave-girl to bring it.

6. And she opened [it], and she saw the child. And behold, a boy wept. And she had pity on him, and said, This [is] one of the Hebrews' sons.

7. And his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call a woman, a nurse of the Hebrew women for you, that she may nurse the child for you?

8. And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the girl went and called [the] child's mother.

9. And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away and nurse it for me, and I will give your wages. And the woman took the child and nursed it.

10. And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses. And she said, Because I took him out of the water.

11. And it happened in those days, when Moses was grown, he went out to his brothers and looked upon their burdens. And he saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers.

12. And he looked this way and that way, and when he did not see anyone, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.

13. And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together. And he said to the guilty one, Why do you strike your neighbor?

14. And he said, Who made you as a man, a ruler and a judge over us? Do you intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.

15. And when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and lived in the land of Midian. And [he] sat down by a well.

16. And the priest of Midian [had] seven daughters. And they came and drew, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.

17. And the shepherds came and drove them away. But Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.

18. And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, Why have you hurried to come today?

19. And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew for us and watered the flock.

20. And he said to his daughters, And where [is] he? Why then have you left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.

21. And Moses was content to live with the man. And he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah.

22. And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom. For he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.

23. And it happened after many days the king of Egypt died. And the sons of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the bondage.

24. And God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

25. And God looked upon the sons of Israel, and God knew [them].

## Exodus 3

1. And Moses kept the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. And he led the flock to the back side of the desert. And he came to the mountain of God, to Horeb.

2. And the Angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire, out of the midst of a thorn bush. And he looked. And behold! The thorn bush burned with fire! And the thorn bush [was] not burned up.

3. And Moses said, I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the thorn bush is not burned up.

4. And the LORD saw that he had turned aside to see. God called to him out of the midst of the thorn bush, and said, Moses! Moses! And he said, Here I [am].

5. And He said, Do not come near here. Put off your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you stand [is] holy ground.

6. And He said, I [am] the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.

7. And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of My people who [are] in Egypt; I have heard their cry because of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows.

8. And I am coming down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, to bring them up out of that land, to a good land, a large land, to a land flowing [with] milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites and the Jebusites.

9. And now behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to Me. And I have also seen the oppression [with] which the Egyptians oppress them.

10. And now go, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring forth My people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt.

11. And Moses said to God, Who [am] I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the sons of Israel out of Egypt?

12. And He said, I will be with you. And this [shall be] the sign to you that I have sent you: When you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God upon this mountain.

13. And Moses said to God, Behold, [when] I come to the sons of Israel, and shall say to them, The God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they shall say to me, What [is] His name? What shall I say to them?

14. And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM. And He said, So you shall say to the sons of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.

15. And God said to Moses again, You shall say this to the sons of Israel, Jehovah the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This [is My name forever, and this [is] My title from generation to generation.

16. Go, and gather the elders of Israel and say to them, Jehovah the God of your fathers has appeared to me, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, I have surely visited you and [have seen what] is done to you in Egypt.

17. And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.

18. And they shall listen to your voice. And you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt. And you shall say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews has met with us. And now let us go, we beseech you, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.

19. And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.

20. And I will stretch out My hand and smite Egypt with all My wonders which I will do in the midst of it. And after that he will let you go.

21. And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. And it shall be that when you go, you shall not go empty.

22. But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her that stays in her house, jewels of silver and jewels of gold and clothing. And you shall put [them] upon your sons and upon your daughters. And you shall plunder the Egyptians.

## Exodus 4

1. And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me nor listen to my voice. For they will say, The LORD has not appeared to you.

2. And the LORD said to him, What [is] this in your hand? And he said, A staff.

3. And He said, Throw it on the ground. And he threw it on the ground. And it became a serpent. And Moses ran from it.

4. And the LORD said to Moses, Put forth your hand and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand, --

5. so that they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.

6. And the LORD said to him again, Now put your hand in your bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom. And when he took it out, behold, his hand [was] as leprous as snow.

7. And He said, Put your hand into your bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again. And he brought it out of his bosom, and behold, it was turned again like his [other] flesh.

8. And it will be, if they will not believe you, neither listen to the voice of the first sign, then they will believe the voice of the latter sign.

9. And also it will be, if they will not believe these two signs, neither listen to your voice, then you shall take from the water of the river and pour [it] upon the dry land. And the water which you take out of the river shall become blood on the dry land.

10. And Moses said to the LORD, O my Lord, I [am] not a man of words now, nor since You have spoken to Your servant, but I [am] slow of speech and of a slow tongue.

11. And the LORD said to him, Who has made man's mouth? Or who makes the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? Have not I, the LORD?

12. And now go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall say.

13. And he said, O my Lord, I pray You, send by the hand [of him whom] You will send.

14. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses. And He said, Do I not know Aaron the Levite, your brother that he can speak well? And also, behold, he comes forth to meet you. And when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.

15. And you shall speak to him, and you shall put words in his mouth. And I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.

16. And it will be, he shall speak for you to the people, and he shall be for a mouth to you. And you shall be to him a god.

17. And you shall take this rod in your hand, [with] which you shall do signs.

18. And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Please let me go and return to my brothers who [are] in Egypt and see if they [are] still alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.

19. And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, Go! Return to Egypt, for all the men who sought your life are dead.

20. And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand.

21. And the LORD said to Moses, When you go to return into Egypt, see that you do all those wonders which I have put in your hand before Pharaoh; but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.

22. And you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus says the Lord: Israel [is] My son, My first-born.

23. And I say to you, Let My son go, that he may serve Me. And if you refuse to let him go, behold, I [am] going to kill your son, your first-born.

24. And it happened by the way, in the inn, that the LORD met him and sought to kill him.

25. And Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and threw [it] at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband you [are] to me.

26. So He let him go. Then she said, [You are] a bloody husband, because of the circumcision.

27. And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.

28. And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which He had commanded him.

29. And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the sons of Israel.

30. And Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.

31. And the people believed. And when they heard that the LORD had visited the sons of Israel, and that He had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed and worshiped.

## Exodus 5

1. And afterward Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh, Thus says Jehovah, God of Israel: Let My people go, that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness.

2. And Pharaoh said, Who [is] Jehovah, that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I do not know Jehovah, neither will I let Israel go.

3. And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us go, we pray you, three days' journey into the desert and sacrifice to the LORD our God, lest He fall upon us with plague or with the sword.

4. And the king of Egypt said to them, Moses and Aaron, Why do you keep the people from their work? Get to your burdens!

5. And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now [are] many, and you make them rest from their burdens.

6. And Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers the same day, saying,

7. You shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.

8. And you shall lay upon them the number of bricks which they have made before now. You shall not take away from it. For they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go sacrifice to our God.

9. Let more work be laid upon the men, and let them labor in it. And do not let them regard vain words.

10. And the taskmasters of the people and their officers went out. And they spoke to the people, saying, So says Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.

11. Go and get straw where you can find it, yet not any of your work shall be taken away.

12. So the people were scattered through all the land of Egypt, to gather stubble for straw.

13. And the taskmasters hurried [them], saying, Finish your works, the thing of a day, just as when there was straw.

14. And the overseers of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten. [And they] demanded, Why have you not completed your task in making brick, both yesterday and today, as you did before?

15. And the overseers of the sons of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why do you deal so with your servants?

16. There is no straw given to your servants, and they say to us, Make bricks! And behold, your servants [are] beaten, but the fault is in your own people.

17. But he said, You [are] idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, Let us go, let us sacrifice to the LORD.

18. Therefore go now [and] work, for there shall be no straw given to you; yet you shall deliver the number of bricks.

19. And the overseers of the sons of Israel saw themselves in affliction, after it was said, You shall not take away from your bricks of your daily task.

20. And they met Moses and Aaron standing in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh.

21. And they said to them, The LORD look upon you and judge, because you have made our smell to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hands to kill us.

22. And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Lord, why have You treated this people ill? Why then have you sent me?

23. For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done evil to this people. Neither have You delivered Your people at all.

## Exodus 6

1. And the LORD said to Moses, Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh. For with a strong hand he shall let them go, and with a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land.

2. And God spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am Jehovah.

3. And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob [as] God Almighty. But I was not known to them [by] the name JEHOVAH.

4. And I also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, in which they were strangers.

5. And I have also heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, those whom the Egyptians are keeping in bondage. And I have remembered My covenant.

6. Therefore say to the sons of Israel, I [am] Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rescue you out of their bondage. And I will redeem you with a stretched-out arm, and with great judgments.

7. And I will take you to Me for a people, and I will be to you a God. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD your God, who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

8. And I will bring you in to the land concerning which I lifted up My hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. And I will give it to you for a heritage. I [am] the LORD!

9. And Moses said so to the sons of Israel. But they did not listen to Moses through shortness of spirit and through cruel bondage.

10. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

11. Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the sons of Israel go out of his land.

12. And Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, Behold, the sons of Israel have not listened to me. How then shall Pharaoh hear me, since I have lips that are not circumcised?

13. And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a charge to the sons of Israel, and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

14. These [were] the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. These [were] the families of Reuben.

15. And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanitess. These [were] the families of Simeon.

16. And these [were] the names of the sons of Levi, according to their generations: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi [were] a hundred and thirty-seven years.

17. The sons of Gershon: Libni, and Shimei, by their families.

18. And the sons of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel. And the years of the life of Kohath [were] a hundred and thirty-three years.

19. And the sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These [were] the families of Levi according to their generations.

20. And Amram took Jochebed, his father's sister, for his wife. And she bore him Aaron and Moses. And the years of the life of Amram [were] a hundred and thirty-seven years.

21. And the sons of Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.

22. And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.

23. And Aaron took Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, sister of Nahshon, for his wife. And she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.

24. And the sons of Korah [were] Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These [were] the families of the Korahites.

25. And Aaron's son Eleazar took his wife of the daughters of Putiel. And she bore him Phinehas. These [were] the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.

26. It [was] Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, Bring out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.

27. These [were] the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring out the sons of Israel from Egypt. It was Moses and Aaron.

28. And it happened on the day the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt:

29. the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, I [am] the LORD. You speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say to you.

30. And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I [am] of uncircumcised lips, and how [shall] Pharaoh listen to me?

## Exodus 7

1. And the LORD said to Moses, See, I have made you a god to Pharaoh. And Aaron your brother shall be your prophet.

2. You shall speak all that I command you. And Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh, he will send the sons of Israel out of his land.

3. And I will harden Pharaoh's heart and multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt.

4. But Pharaoh shall not listen to you, and I will lay My hand upon Egypt, and bring My armies, My people the sons of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.

5. And the Egyptians shall know that I [am] the LORD when I stretch forth My hand upon Egypt, and bring out the sons of Israel from among them.

6. And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them; so they did.

7. And Moses [was] eighty years old, and Aaron [was] eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.

8. And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying:

9. When Pharaoh shall speak to you saying, Give a miracle for yourselves, you shall say to Aaron, Take your rod, and throw [it] in front of Pharaoh. It shall become a snake.

10. And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh. And they did so, as the LORD had commanded. And Aaron threw down his rod in front of Pharaoh and in front of his servants, and it became a snake.

11. Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers. And they, the priests of Egypt, did the same with their secret arts.

12. For each man threw down his rod, and they became snakes. But Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

13. And He hardened Pharaoh's heart so that he did not listen to them, as the LORD had said.

14. And the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh's heart [is] hardened. He refuses to let the people go.

15. You go to Pharaoh in the morning. Lo, he goes out to the water. And you shall stand by the river's brink until he comes. And you shall take in your hand the rod which was turned to a snake.

16. And you shall say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews has sent me to you, saying, Let My people go so that they may serve Me in the wilderness. And, behold, until now you would not hear.

17. Thus says the LORD, In this you shall know that I [am] the LORD. Behold! I will smite with the rod that [is] in my hand upon the waters in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.

18. And the fish in the river shall die, and the river shall stink. And the Egyptians shall hate to drink of the water of the river.

19. And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take your rod, and stretch out your hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their canals, and upon their pools, and upon every reservoir of their waters, [that] they may become blood. And blood shall be throughout all the land of Egypt, both in wooden and in stone [vessels].

20. And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded. And he lifted up the rod and struck the waters that [were] in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants. And all the waters in the river were turned to blood.

21. And the fish in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river. And there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.

22. And the priests of Egypt did so with their secret arts. And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had said.

23. And Pharaoh turned and went into his house; And he did not set his heart to this also.

24. And all the Egyptians dug all around the river for water to drink, for they could not drink of the water of the river.

25. And seven days were completed after the LORD had stricken the river.

## Exodus 8

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, Go to Pharaoh, and say to him: Thus says the LORD, Let my people go so that they may serve Me.

2. And if you refuse to let [them] go, behold, I [am] going to strike all your borders [with] frogs.

3. And the river shall bring forth frogs plentifully, which shall go up and come into your house, and into your bedroom, and upon your bed, and into the house of your servants, and upon your people, and into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs.

4. And the frogs shall come upon you, and upon your people, and upon all your servants.

5. And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron: Stretch out your hand with your rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.

6. And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.

7. And the priests did so with their secret arts, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.

8. And Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Pray to the LORD that He may take away the frogs from me and from my people. And I will let the people go, so that they may sacrifice to the LORD.

9. And Moses said to Pharaoh, Glory over me! When shall I pray for you, and for your servants, and for your people, to destroy the frogs from you and your houses, so [that] they may remain in the river only?

10. And he said, Tomorrow. And he said, It shall be according to your word, so that you may know that [there is] none like the LORD our God.

11. And the frogs shall depart from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people. They shall remain in the river only.

12. And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh. And Moses cried to the LORD because of the frogs which He had brought against Pharaoh.

13. And the LORD did according to the word of Moses. And the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.

14. And they gathered them in heaps [and] heaps. And the land stank.

15. But Pharaoh saw that [there] was relief, and he hardened his heart, and did not listen to them, even as the LORD had said.

16. And the LORD said to Moses, Say to Aaron: Stretch out your rod, and strike the dust of the land, so that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.

17. And they did so. For Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and struck the dust of the earth. And it became lice in man and in beast. All the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.

18. And the priests did so with their secret arts to bring forth lice, but they could not. So there were lice upon man and upon beast.

19. And the priests said to Pharaoh, This [is] the finger of God. And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had said.

20. And the LORD said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh. Lo, he comes forth to the water. And say to him, Thus says the LORD: Let My people go, so that they may serve Me.

21. And if you will not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms [of flies] on you, and on your servants, and on your people, and into your house. And the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms [of flies], and also the ground on which they [are].

22. And in that day I will cut off the land of Goshen, in which My people live, so that no swarms [of flies] shall be there, so that you may know that I [am] Jehovah in the midst of the earth.

23. And I will put a dividing line between My people and your people. This miracle shall be tomorrow.

24. And the LORD did so. And teeming swarms [of flies] came into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt. The land was destroyed because of the swarms.

25. And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go sacrifice to your God in the land.

26. And Moses said, It is not right to do so, for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God. Lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?

27. We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as He shall command us.

28. And Pharaoh said, I will let you go so that you may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness. Only you shall not go very far away. Pray for me.

29. And Moses said, Behold, I will go out from you, and I will pray to the LORD that the swarms [of flies] may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow. But do not let Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.

30. And Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.

31. And the LORD did according to the word of Moses. And He removed the swarms from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. There remained not one.

32. And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.

## Exodus 9

1. And the LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh and tell him, Thus says the LORD God of the Hebrews: Let My people go so that they may serve Me.

2. For if you refuse to let [them] go, and will hold them still,

3. behold, the hand of the LORD is upon your cattle in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep, a very grievous plague.

4. And the LORD shall separate between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt. And there shall nothing die of all [that belongs] to the sons of Israel.

5. And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, Tomorrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land.

6. And the LORD did that thing on the next day, and all the cattle of Egypt died. But of the cattle of the sons of Israel, not one died.

7. And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.

8. And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, Take to yourselves handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh.

9. And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth [with] sores upon man and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.

10. And they took ashes of the furnace and stood before Pharaoh. And Moses sprinkled it up toward the sky, and it became a boil breaking forth [with] sores upon man and upon beast.

11. And the priests could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boil was upon the priests and upon all the Egyptians.

12. And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not listen to them, even as the LORD had spoken to Moses.

13. And the LORD said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, So says the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let My people go, so that they may serve Me.

14. For I [am] going to send at this time all My plagues upon your heart, and upon your servants, and upon your people, so that you may know that [there is] none like Me in all the earth.

15. For now I will stretch out My hand, that I may strike you and your people with plagues, and you shall be cut off from the earth.

16. And for this I have made you stand, to make you see My power, to declare My name in all the land.

17. Do you still exalt yourself against My people, that you will not let them go?

18. Behold! Tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, [such as] has not been in Egypt since the foundation of it even until now!

19. And now send out, gather your cattle, and all that you have in the field. Upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.

20. He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle to flee into the houses.

21. And he that did not regard the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.

22. And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch forth your hand toward heaven, so that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.

23. And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heavens. And the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire came down to the ground. And the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.

24. And [there] was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.

25. And the hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that [was] in the field, both man and beast. And the hail struck every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.

26. Only in the land of Goshen, where the sons of Israel [were], was there no hail.

27. And Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned [this] time. Jehovah [is] righteous, and I and my people are wicked.

28. Pray to the LORD, [for it is] enough. Let there be no mighty thunderings and hail. And I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.

29. And Moses said to him, as soon as I go out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to the LORD. The thunder shall stop, and the hail will not be any more, so that you may know that the earth is the LORD's.

30. But [as for] you and your servants, I know that you will not yet fear the LORD God.

31. And the flax and the barley [were] stricken, for the barley was in the head, and the flax was in bud.

32. But the wheat and the rye were not stricken, for they had not grown up.

33. And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to the LORD. And the thunder and hail stopped, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.

34. And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders had ceased, he sinned still more and hardened his heart, he and his servants.

35. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the sons of Israel go, even as the LORD had spoken by Moses.

## Exodus 10

1. And the LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, so that I might show these My signs before him,

2. and so that you may tell in the ears of your son, and of your son's sons, what things I have worked in Egypt, and My signs which I have done among them, so that you may know that I [am] the LORD.

3. And Moses and Aaron came in to Pharaoh and said to him, So says the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, so that they may serve Me.

4. For if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring the locusts into your coast.

5. And they shall cover the face of the land, so that one cannot be able to see the earth. And they shall eat the rest of that which has escaped, which remains to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field.

6. And they shall fill your houses, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians, which neither your fathers, nor your fathers' fathers have seen, since the day they were upon the earth until this day. And he turned himself and went out from Pharaoh.

7. And Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go so that they may serve the LORD their God. Do you not yet know that Egypt is destroyed?

8. And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh, and he said to them, Go! Serve the LORD your God. Who [are] the ones that shall go?

9. And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters. We will go with our flocks and with our herds. For we [must hold] a feast to the LORD.

10. And he said to them, May the LORD be so with you, as I send you and your little ones away. Watch out, for evil [is] before you.

11. Not so! You men go now and serve the LORD, for it is you who did desire it. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.

12. And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt and eat every herb of the land, all that the hail has left.

13. And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all the night. When it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.

14. And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt and rested in all the coasts of Egypt, very numerous. Before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.

15. For they covered the face of the whole earth so that the land was darkened. And they ate every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. And there did not remain any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.

16. Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste. And he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.

17. And now please, forgive my sin only this once, and pray to the LORD your God, that He may take away from me this death only.

18. And he went out from Pharaoh, and prayed [to] the LORD.

19. And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts and threw them into the Red Sea. There did not remain one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.

20. But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go.

21. And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward the heavens, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, so that one may even feel the darkness.

22. And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven. And there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.

23. They did not see one another, nor did any rise from his place, [for] three days. But all the sons of Israel had light in their dwellings.

24. And Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, You go serve the LORD. Only let your flocks and your herds be left. Let your little ones also go with you.

25. And Moses said, You must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, so that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.

26. Our cattle also shall go with us. There shall not be a hoof left behind. For we must take from them to serve the LORD our God. And we do not know [with] what we must serve the LORD until we come there.

27. But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.

28. And Pharaoh said to him, Go away from me! Take heed to yourself; see my face no more. For in the day you see my face you shall die.

29. And Moses said, You have spoken well. I will never see your face again.

## Exodus 11

1. And the LORD said to Moses, I will still bring one plague yet on Pharaoh and on Egypt. Afterward he will let you go from here. When he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out from here altogether.

2. Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow from his neighbor, and every woman from her neighbor, articles of silver and jewels of gold.

3. And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. And the man Moses [was] very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.

4. And Moses said, Thus says the LORD: About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt.

5. And all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sits upon his throne, even to the first-born of the slave-girl that [is] behind the mill; also the first-born of beasts.

6. And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.

7. But against any of the sons of Israel not even a dog shall move his tongue, against man or beast, so that you may know that the LORD puts a difference [between] the Egyptians and Israel.

8. And all these, your servants, shall come down to me and bow themselves down to me, saying, You and all the people that follow you get out. And after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.

9. And the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh shall not listen to you, so that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.

10. And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh. And the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart so that he would not let the sons of Israel go out of his land.

## Exodus 12

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,

2. This month [shall be] to you the beginning of months. It shall be the first month of the year to you.

3. Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth of this month they shall take to them each man a lamb for a father's house, a lamb for a house.

4. And if the household is too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next to his house take according to the number of the souls, each one, according to the eating of his mouth, you shall count concerning the lamb.

5. Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year. You shall take from the sheep or from the goats.

6. And you shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month. And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.

7. And they shall take of the blood and strike on the two side posts and upon the upper door post of the houses [in] which they shall eat it.

8. And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire, and unleavened [bread]. They shall eat it with [bitter] herbs.

9. Do not eat of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted [with] fire, its head with its legs, and with its inward parts.

10. And you shall not let any of it remain until the morning. And that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire.

11. And you shall eat of it this way, [with] your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. And you shall eat it in a hurry. It [is] the LORD's passover.

12. For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast. And I will execute judgments against all the gods of Egypt. I [am] the LORD.

13. And the blood shall be a sign to you upon the houses where you [are]. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you. And the plague shall not be upon you for a destruction when I smite in the land of Egypt.

14. And this day shall be a memorial to you. And you shall keep it as a feast to the LORD throughout your generations. You shall keep it [as] a feast by a law forever.

15. You shall eat unleavened [bread] seven days; even the first day you shall put away leaven out of your houses. For whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.

16. And on the first day [shall be] a holy gathering, and in the seventh day there shall be a holy gathering for you. No manner of work shall be done in them, except that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you.

17. And you shall keep the [Feast of] Unleavened [Bread]. For in this same day I have brought your armies out of the land of Egypt. Therefore you shall keep this day in your generations by a law forever.

18. In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened [bread], until the twenty-first day of the month at evening.

19. Seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses. For whoever eats that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, among the aliens and among the natives of the land.

20. You shall eat nothing leavened. In all your dwelling-places you shall eat unleavened [bread].

21. Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said to them, Draw out and take a lamb for yourselves according to your families, and kill the passover.

22. And you shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip in the blood in the bowl, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood in the bowl. And none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.

23. For the LORD will pass through to strike the Egyptians. And when He sees the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to come into your houses to strike you.

24. And you shall observe this thing for a law to you and to your sons forever.

25. And it shall be, when you have come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as He has promised, that you shall keep this service.

26. And it will be, when your sons shall say to you, What is this service to you?

27. Then you shall say, It [is] the sacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt, when He struck the Egyptians and delivered our houses. And the people bowed and worshiped.

28. And the sons of Israel went away and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron; so they did.

29. And it happened at midnight the LORD struck all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne to the first-born of the captive that [was] in the prison; also all the first-born of cattle.

30. And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he and all his servants, and all the Egyptians. And there was a great cry in Egypt, for [there was] not a house where there was not one dead.

31. And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up! Get away from my people, both you and the sons of Israel! And go serve the LORD, as you have said.

32. Also take your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and go. And bless me also.

33. And the Egyptians were urging the people, that they might send them out of the land in a hurry. For they said, We [are] all dead.

34. And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.

35. And the sons of Israel did according to the word of Moses. And they borrowed articles of silver, and articles of gold, and clothing from the Egyptians.

36. And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, and they granted their request, and they plundered the Egyptians.

37. And the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, the men being about six hundred thousand men on foot, apart from little ones.

38. And also a mixed multitude went up with them, and flocks, and herds, very much cattle.

39. And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought out of Egypt, for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not stay, neither had they prepared any food for a journey for themselves.

40. And the time that the sons of Israel lived in Egypt [was] four hundred and thirty years.

41. And it happened at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even it was on this very day, all the armies of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.

42. It [is] a night to be much kept to the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This [is] that night of the LORD to be kept by all the sons of Israel in their generations.

43. And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, This [is] the ordinance of the Passover. No stranger shall eat of it.

44. But every man's servant that is bought for silver, when you have circumcised him, then he shall eat of it.

45. A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat of it.

46. It shall be eaten in one house. You shall not carry any of the flesh out of the house. Neither shall you break a bone of it.

47. All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

48. And when a stranger shall stay with you, and desires to keep the Passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it. And he shall be as one that is born in the land. And no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.

49. There shall be one law to the native, and to the visitor that stays among you.

50. So all the sons of Israel did. Even as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.

51. And it happened the very same day, [that] the LORD brought the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.

## Exodus 13

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Sanctify all the first-born to Me, whatever opens the womb among the sons of Israel, of man and of beast. It [is] Mine.

3. And Moses said to the people, Remember this day [in] which you came out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. For the LORD brought you out from this place by the strength of His hand. There shall be no leavened bread eaten.

4. You are going out this day in the month Abib.

5. And it shall be when the LORD shall bring you into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this service in this month.

6. You shall eat unleavened [bread] seven days, and in the seventh day [shall be] a feast to the LORD.

7. Unleavened [bread] shall be eaten seven days. And there shall be no leavened [bread] seen with you, nor shall there be leaven seen with you in all your borders.

8. And you shall tell your son in that day, saying, This is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out from Egypt.

9. And it shall be a sign to you upon your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, that the LORD's law may be in your mouth. For the Lord has brought you out of Egypt with a strong hand.

10. You shall therefore keep this law in its season from year to year.

11. And it will be, when the LORD shall bring you into the land of the Canaanites, as He swore to you and to your fathers, and shall give it to you,

12. you shall set apart to the LORD every one that opens the womb, and every first-born that comes of any animal which you have; the males [shall be] the LORD's.

13. And every first-born of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb. And if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. And all the first-born of man among your sons you shall redeem.

14. And it shall be when your sons asks you in time to come, saying, What [is] this? you shall say to him, The LORD brought us out of Egypt by the strength of [His] hand, from the house of bondage.

15. And it happened when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, the LORD killed all the first-born of the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man, and the first-born of animals. Therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that opens the womb, that are males. But all the first-born of my sons I redeem.

16. And it shall be for a token upon your hand, and for frontlets between your eyes. For the LORD brought us out from Egypt by strength of [His] hand.

17. And it happened, when Pharaoh had let the people go, God did not lead them [by] the way of the land of the Philistines although that [was] near. For God said, Lest the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt.

18. But God led the people around, [by] the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea. And the sons of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.

19. And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him. For he had strictly sworn the sons of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and you shall carry my bones away from here with you.

20. And they moved from Succoth and camped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.

21. And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the right away, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, to go by day and night.

22. He did not take away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, [from] before the people.

## Exodus 14

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel that they turn and camp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon. You shall camp before [it], by the sea.

3. For Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel, They [are] tangled in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.

4. And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he will follow them. And I will be honored upon Pharaoh, and upon all his army, so that the Egyptians may know that I [am] the LORD. And they did so.

5. And the king of Egypt was told that the people fled. And the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people. And they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?

6. And he made his chariot ready, and took his people with him.

7. And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.

8. And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And he pursued the sons of Israel, and the sons of Israel went out with a high hand.

9. But the Egyptians pursued them, all the horses [and] chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army. And they overtook them camping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal-zephon.

10. And Pharaoh drew near, the sons of Israel lifted up their eyes. And, behold, the Egyptians marched after them. And they were very afraid. And the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD.

11. And they said to Moses, Have you taken us away to die in the wilderness because [there were] no graves in Egypt? Why have you dealt this way with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?

12. Did we not tell you this word in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, so that we may serve the Egyptians? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.

13. And Moses said to the people, Do not fear. Stand still and see the salvation of the LORD, which He will prepare for you this day. For the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you shall never see them anymore.

14. The LORD shall fight for you, and you shall be silent.

15. And the LORD said to Moses, Why do you cry to Me? Speak to the sons of Israel, that they go forward.

16. But lift up your rod and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it. And the sons of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.

17. And behold! I [am] about to harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them. And I will get honor for Me upon Pharaoh, and upon all his army, upon his chariots and upon his horsemen.

18. And the Egyptians shall know that I [am] the LORD when I have gotten honor for Me upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

19. And the Angel of God, the one who went before the camp of Israel, moved. And he went to the rear of them. And the pillar of the cloud went from in front of their face and it stood behind them.

20. And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. And it was a cloudy and dark night, but it gave light to the night, so that the one did not come near the other all night.

21. And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea. And the LORD caused the sea to recede by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.

22. And the sons of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground. And the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.

23. And the Egyptians pursued and went after them to the middle of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.

24. And in the morning watch it happened that the LORD looked to the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the army of the Egyptians.

25. And He took off their chariot wheels, and made them go heavily, so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel, for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians.

26. And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea, so that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.

27. And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea. And the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared. And the Egyptians fled against it. And the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the middle of the sea.

28. And the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen, all the army of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them. There did not remain so much as one of them.

29. But the sons of Israel walked upon dry land in the middle of the sea. And the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.

30. So the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians. And Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore.

31. And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians. And the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD and His servant Moses.

## Exodus 15

1. Then the sons of Moses and Israel sang this song to the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing to the LORD, for He has triumphed gloriously; [the] horse and his rider He has thrown into the sea.

2. The LORD [is] my strength and song, and He has become my salvation. He is my God, and I will glorify Him, my father's God, and I will exalt Him.

3. The LORD [is] a Man of war; Jehovah [is] His name.

4. Pharaoh's chariots and his army He has thrown into the sea; his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea.

5. The depths have covered them; they sank into the bottom like a stone.

6. Your right hand, O LORD, has become glorious in power. Your right hand, O LORD, has dashed the enemy in pieces.

7. And in the greatness of Your excellency You have overthrown them that rose up against You. You sent forth Your wrath, consuming them like stubble.

8. And with the blast of Your nostrils the waters were gathered together; the floods stood upright like a heap; the depths were curdled in the heart of the sea.

9. The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them, I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.

10. You blew with Your wind; the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.

11. Who [is] like You, O LORD, among the gods? Who [is] like You, glorious in holiness, fearful [in] praises, doing wonders?

12. You stretched out Your right hand, the earth swallowed them.

13. You in Your mercy have led forth the people [which] You have redeemed. You have guided them in Your strength to Your holy habitation.

14. The people shall hear, being afraid. Sorrow shall take hold on the people of Philistia.

15. Then the princes of Edom [were] terrified. Trembling seized upon the mighty men of Moab. All the people of Canaan shall melt away.

16. Fear and dread shall fall upon them. By the greatness of Your arm they shall be still as a stone, until Your people pass over, O LORD; until the people [whom] You have purchased pass over.

17. You shall bring them and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance, the place, O LORD, You have made for You to dwell in; the Sanctuary, O LORD, [which] Your hands have established.

18. The LORD shall reign forever and ever.

19. For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them. But the sons of Israel went on dry land in the middle of the sea.

20. And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand. And all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.

21. And Miriam answered them, Sing to the LORD, for He has triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider He has thrown into the sea.

22. And Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur. And they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.

23. And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, because it [was] bitter. Therefore the name of it was called Marah.

24. And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?

25. And he cried to the LORD. And the LORD showed him a tree. And when he had cast it into the waters, the waters were made sweet. There He made a decree and a law for them, and there He tested them.

26. And he said, If you will carefully listen to the voice of the LORD your God, and will do that which is right in His sight, and will give ear to His commandments, and keep all His laws, I will put none of these diseases upon you, which I have brought upon the Egyptians; for I [am] the LORD who heals you.

27. And they came to Elim, where [there were] twelve wells of water, and seventy palm trees. And they camped there by the waters.

## Exodus 16

1. And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the sons of Israel came into the wilderness of Sin, which [is] between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month  after] their departing out of the land of Egypt.

2. And the whole congregation of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.

3. And the sons of Israel said to them, O that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, when we ate bread to the full! For you have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.

4. Then the LORD said to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from the heavens for you. And the people shall go out and gather a certain amount every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in My law or not.

5. And on the sixth day it shall happen, they shall prepare what they bring in. And it shall be twice as much as they gather day by day.

6. And Moses and Aaron said to all the sons of Israel, At evening, then you shall know that the LORD has brought you out from the land of Egypt.

7. And in the morning, then you shall see the glory of the LORD. For He hears your murmurings against the LORD. And what [are] we, that you murmur against us?

8. And Moses said, You will see when the LORD shall give you flesh to eat in the evening and bread to the full in the morning, when the LORD hears your murmurings which you murmur against Him. And what are we? Your murmurings [are] not against us, but against the LORD.

9. And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, Come near before the LORD. For He has heard your murmurings.

10. And it happened as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the sons of Israel, they turned toward the wilderness. And behold! The glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud!

11. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

12. I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel. Speak to them, saying, You shall eat flesh at evening, and in the morning you shall be filled [with] bread. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD your God.

13. And it happened at evening, the quails came up and covered the camp. And in the morning the dew lay all around the host.

14. And when the layer of dew had gone up, behold, [there was] a small round thing upon the face of the wilderness, small as the hoar-frost upon the ground.

15. And when the sons of Israel saw, they said each one to his brother, What [is] that? For they did not know what it [was]. And Moses said to them, This [is] the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.

16. This [is] the thing which the LORD has commanded: Each man gather of it according to his eating, an omer for a head, according to the number of your souls. Each one shall take for those who [are] in his camp.

17. And the sons of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, and some less.

18. And when they measured with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little lacked nothing. They gathered each one according to his eating.

19. And Moses said, Let no man leave of it until the morning.

20. But they did not listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning. And it became rotten [with] maggots, and stank. And Moses was angry with them.

21. And they gathered it every morning, each man according to his eating. And when the sun became hot, it melted.

22. And it happened, on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one. And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.

23. And he said to them, This [is that] which the LORD has said, Tomorrow is the rest of the holy sabbath to the LORD. Bake what you will bake [today], and boil what you will boil. And that which remains over, lay up for you to be kept until the morning.

24. And they laid it up until the morning, as Moses said. And it did not stink, neither was there any worm in it.

25. And Moses said, Eat that today. For today [is] a sabbath to the LORD. Today you shall not find it in the field.

26. Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the sabbath, in it there shall be none.

27. And it happened [some] of the people went out on the seventh day in order to gather. And they did not find [any].

28. And the LORD said to Moses, How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws?

29. See, because the LORD has given you the sabbath, therefore He gives you the bread of two days on the sixth day. Each one stay in his place. Let not any one go out of his place on the seventh day.

30. So the people rested on the seventh day.

31. And the house of Israel called the name of it Manna. And it [was] like coriander seed, white. And the taste of it [was] like wafers with honey.

32. And Moses said, This [is] the thing which the LORD has commanded: Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations, so that you may see the bread with which I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.

33. And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot and put an omer full of manna in it, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.

34. As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.

35. And the sons of Israel ate manna forty years, until they came to a land in which people lived. They ate manna until they came into the borders of the land of Canaan.

36. And an omer [is] the tenth part of an ephah.

## Exodus 17

1. And all the congregation of the sons of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the command of the Lord, and pitched in Rephidim. And [there was] no water for the people to drink.

2. And the people wrangled with Moses and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them, Why do you wrangle with me? Why do you tempt the LORD?

3. And the people thirsted there for water. And the people murmured against Moses and said, Why [is] this, [that] You brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our sons and our cattle with thirst?

4. And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, What shall I do to this people? They are almost ready to stone me.

5. And the LORD said to Moses, Go on in front of the people, and take with you the elders of Israel. And take your rod with which you struck the river, in your hand, and go.

6. Behold, I will stand before you there upon the rock in Horeb. And you shall smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, so that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.

7. And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the wrangling of the sons of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us or not?

8. Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.

9. And Moses said to Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out to fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.

10. And Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.

11. And it happened when Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed. And when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

12. But Moses' hands [became] heavy. And they took a stone and put [it] under him, and he sat on it. And Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. And his hands were steady until the going of the sun.

13. And Joshua defeated Amalek and his people by the mouth of the sword.

14. And the LORD said to Moses, Write this, a memorial in a book, and set [it] in the ears of Joshua, that I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heavens.

15. And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah My Banner.

16. And he said, A hand [is] on the throne of the LORD; war is to the LORD with Amalek from generation to generation.

## Exodus 18

1. When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people, that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt,

2. then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,

3. and her two sons, of which the name of the one [was] Gershom (for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land),

4. and the name of the other [was] Eliezer (for the God of my father, my help, delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.)

5. And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness, where he camped at the mount of God.

6. And he said to Moses, I, your father-in-law Jethro, have come to you, and your wife and her two sons with her.

7. And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed down to him, and kissed him. And they asked each other of [their] welfare. And they came into the tent.

8. And Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and [how] the LORD delivered them.

9. And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom He had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.

10. And Jethro said, Blessed [be] the LORD, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh, and who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.

11. Now I know that Jehovah [is] greater than all gods; for in the thing in which they were proved against them.

12. And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. And Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.

13. And on the next day it happened that Moses sat to judge the people. And the people stood by Moses from the morning to the evening.

14. And when Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What [is] this thing which you do to the people? Why do you sit alone by yourself, and all the people stand by you from morning to evening?

15. And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God.

16. When they have a matter, they come to me. And I judge between one and another, and I make known the statutes of God and His laws.

17. And Moses' father-in-law said to him, The thing that you do [is] not good.

18. You will surely wear away, both you and this people that [is] with you. For this thing [is] too heavy for you; you are not able to perform it alone.

19. Listen now to my voice; I will give you counsel, and God will be with you. You be for the people toward God, that you may bring the causes to God.

20. And you shall teach them ordinances and laws, and shall make them know the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.

21. And you shall look out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness. And place [such] over them to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

22. And let them judge the people at all times. And it shall be, every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge. And make it easier for yourself, and they shall bear with you.

23. If you will do this thing, and God command you, then you shall be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.

24. And Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.

25. And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

26. And they judged the people at all times. The hard causes they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.

27. And Moses let his father-in-law depart. And he went his way into his own land.

## Exodus 19

1. In the third month when the sons of Israel had gone forth out of the land of Egypt, on this day they came [to] the wilderness of Sinai.

2. And they journeyed from Rephidim, and came [to] the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness. And Israel camped there in front of the mount.

3. And Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him out of the mountain, saying, You shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the sons of Israel:

4. You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to Myself.

5. And now if you will obey My voice indeed, and keep My covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure to Me above all the nations; for all the earth [is] Mine.

6. And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These [are] the words which you shall speak to the sons of Israel.

7. And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.

8. And all the people answered together and said, All that the LORD has spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people to the LORD.

9. And the LORD said to Moses, Lo, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you forever. And Moses told the words of the people to the LORD.

10. And the LORD said to Moses, Go to the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes.

11. And be ready for the third day. For the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon Mount Sinai.

12. And you shall set bounds to the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves. Do not go up into the mountain, or touch the border of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death.

13. There shall not be a hand to touch it, but that he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether beast or man, it shall not live. When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mountain.

14. And Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified the people. And they washed their clothes.

15. And he said to the people, Be ready for the third day. Do not approach a woman.

16. And it happened on the third day in the morning, that there [were] thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mountain. And the voice of the trumpet was exceedingly loud, so that all the people in the camp trembled.

17. And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God. And they stood at the lower part of the mountain.

18. And Mount Sinai was smoking, all of it, because the LORD came down upon it in fire. And the smoke of it went up like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly.

19. And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and became very strong, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.

20. And the LORD came down upon Mount Sinai, on the top of the mountain. And the LORD called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.

21. And the LORD said to Moses, Go down. Command the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.

22. And let the priests also, who come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.

23. And Moses said to the LORD, The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai. For You commanded us, saying, Set bounds around the mountain, and sanctify it.

24. And the LORD said to him, Away! You go down, and you shall come up, you and Aaron with you. But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest He break forth upon them.

25. And Moses went down to the people, and spoke to them.

## Exodus 20

1. And God spoke all these words, saying,

2. I [am] the LORD your God, who has brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

3. You shall have no other gods before Me.

4. You shall not make to yourselves any graven image, or any likeness of [anything] that [is] in the heavens above, or that [is] in the earth beneath, or that [is] in the water under the earth.

5. You shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them. For I the LORD your God [am] a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and fourth [generation] of those that hate me,

6. and showing mercy to thousands of those that love Me and keep My commandments.

7. You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain. For the LORD will not hold him guiltless that takes His name in vain.

8. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.

9. Six days you shall labor and do all your work.

10. But the seventh day [is] the Sabbath of the LORD your God. You shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger within your gates.

11. For [in] six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that [is] in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day, and sanctified it.

12. Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long upon the land which the LORD your God gives you.

13. You shall not kill.

14. You shall not commit adultery.

15. You shall not steal.

16. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

17. You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that [is] your neighbor's.

18. And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking. And when the people saw, they trembled, and stood afar off.

19. And they said to Moses, You speak with us, and we will hear. But let not God speak with us, lest we die.

20. And Moses said to the people, Do not fear, for God has come to test you, and so that His fear may be before your faces, so that you may not sin.

21. And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God [was].

22. And the LORD said to Moses, So you shall say to the sons of Israel, You have seen that I have talked with you from the heavens.

23. You shall not make with Me gods of silver, neither shall you make to you gods of gold.

24. You shall make an altar of earth to Me, and shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen. In all places where I record My name I will come to you, and I will bless you.

25. And if you will make Me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of cut stone. For if you lift up your tool upon it, you have defiled it.

26. And you shall not go up by steps to My altar, that your nakedness be not uncovered on it.

## Exodus 21

1. And these [are] the judgments which you shall set before them.

2. If you buy a Hebrew servant, he shall serve six years. And in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.

3. If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself. If he [was] married, then his wife shall go out with him.

4. If his master has given him a wife, and she has borne him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.

5. And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my sons. I do not want to go out free

6. his master shall bring him to the judges. He shall also bring him to the door or to the door-post. And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall serve him forever.

7. And if a man sells his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.

8. If she does not please her master, who has betrothed her to himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He shall have no power to sell her to a strange nation, since he has dealt deceitfully with her.

9. And if he has betrothed her to his son, he shall deal with her as with daughters.

10. If he takes himself another [wife], her food, her clothing, and her duty of marriage shall not be lessened.

11. And if he does not do these three to her, then she shall go out free without money.

12. He that strikes a man, so that he dies, shall be surely put to death.

13. And if a man does not lie in wait, but God delivers [him] into his hand, then I will appoint you a place where he shall flee.

14. But if a man comes presumptuously upon his neighbor to slay him with guile, you shall take him from My altar, so that he may die.

15. And he that strikes his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.

16. And he that steals a man and sells him, or if he is found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.

17. And he that curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.

18. And if men strive together, and one strikes another with a stone, or with [his] fist, and he does not die, but keeps his bed;

19. if he rises again and walks abroad upon his staff, then he that struck him shall be set free. Only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause [him] to be completely healed.

20. And if a man strikes his servant, or his maidservant, with a rod, and he dies under his hand, he shall surely be punished.

21. But if he continues a day or two, he shall not be punished. For he [is] his money.

22. If men strive and strike a pregnant woman, so that her child comes out, and there is no injury, he shall surely be punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him. And he shall pay as the judges [say]

23. And if [any] injury occurs, then you shall give life for life,

24. eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

25. burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

26. And if a man strike the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, so that it perishes, he shall let him go free on account of his eye.

27. And if he strikes out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth, he shall let him go free on account of his tooth.

28. If an ox gores a man or woman so that they die, then the ox shall surely be stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten. But the owner of the ox [shall be] set free.

29. But if the ox was apt to gore in time past, and his owner has been told, and he has not kept him in, but that he has killed a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.

30. If there is laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatever is laid upon him.

31. Whether he has gored a son, or has gored a daughter, according to this judgment it shall be done to him.

32. If the ox shall gore a manservant or a maidservant, he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.

33. And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass falls in it,

34. the owner of the pit shall make [it] good and give silver to its owner. And the dead shall be his.

35. And in the event the ox of a man damages the ox of a neighbor, so that it dies, then they shall sell the living ox, and they shall divide the money of it. And they shall also divide the dead [ox].

36. Or if it is known that the ox has been apt to gore in time past, and his owner has not kept him in, he shall surely pay ox for ox. And the dead shall be his own.

## Exodus 22

1. If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it or sell it, he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.

2. If a thief is found breaking in, and is struck so that he dies, no blood [shall be] shed for him.

3. If the sun is risen upon him, blood is due for him. He should repay in full. If he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.

4. If the theft is certainly found in his hand alive, whether it is an ox, or an ass, or a sheep, he shall restore double.

5. If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his animal, and shall feed in another man's field; he shall repay from the best of his own field, and the best of his own vineyard.

6. If fire breaks out and catches in thorns, so that the stacks of grain, or the standing grain, or the field, is burned up, he who kindled the fire shall surely repay in full.

7. If a man shall deliver to his neighbor silver or stuff to keep, and it is stolen out of the man's house; if the thief is found, let him pay double.

8. If the thief is not found, then the master of the house shall be brought to the judges, whether he has put his hand to his neighbor's goods.

9. For every case of trespass, for ox, for ass, for sheep, for clothing, for any kind of lost thing, which [another] claims to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges. Whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double to his neighbor.

10. If a man delivers to his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any animal to keep, and it dies, or is hurt, or driven away, no one seeing,

11. an oath of the LORD shall be between them both, that he has not put his hand to his neighbor's goods. And the owner of it shall accept it, and he shall not make [it] good.

12. And if it is stolen from him, he shall fully repay the owner of it.

13. If it is torn in pieces, let him bring it for witness, [and] he shall not make good that which was torn.

14. And if a man borrows from his neighbor, and it is hurt, or dies, and the owner of it not with it, he shall surely make [it] good.

15. If the owner of it [is] with it, he shall not make [it] good. If it is hired, it came for its hire.

16. And if a man lures a virgin who is not promised, and lies with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.

17. If her father utterly refuses to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.

18. You shall not allow a sorceress to live.

19. Anyone lying with an animal shall surely be put to death.

20. One sacrificing to a god, except it is to Jehovah only, he shall be utterly destroyed.

21. You shall neither vex a stranger nor oppress him, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.

22. You shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child.

23. If you afflict them in any way, and they cry at all to Me, I will surely hear their cry.

24. And My wrath shall become hot, and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives shall be widows, and your sons fatherless.

25. If you lend money to one of My people who [is] poor beside you, you shall not be to him as a money-lender, neither shall you lay upon him interest.

26. If you at all take your neighbor's clothing as a pledge, you shall deliver it to him by the time the sun goes down.

27. For that [is] his covering only, it is his clothing for his skin. In what shall he sleep? And it will be, when he cries to Me, I will hear, for I [am] gracious.

28. You shall not revile God, nor curse the ruler of your people.

29. You shall not delay [to offer] the first of your ripe fruits and of your sap. You shall give the first-born of your sons to Me.

30. Likewise you shall do with your oxen [and] with your sheep; it shall be with its dam seven days. On the eighth day you shall give it to Me.

31. And you shall be holy men to Me. Neither shall you eat flesh torn by beasts in the field. You shall throw it to the dogs.

## Exodus 23

1. You shall not raise a false report. Do not put your hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.

2. You shall not follow a multitude to do evil. Neither shall you speak in a cause in order to follow many in order to wrest [judgment].

3. And you should not favor a poor man in his cause.

4. If you meet your enemy's ox or his ass going astray, you shall surely bring it back to him again.

5. If you see the ass of him who hates you lying under his burden, and would hold back from helping him, you shall surely help him.

6. You shall not pervert the judgment of your poor in his cause.

7. Keep far from a false matter, and do not kill the innocent and righteous. For I will not justify the wicked.

8. And you shall take no bribe, for the bribe blinds the wise and perverts the words of the righteous.

9. Also you shall not oppress a stranger. For you know the heart of a stranger, since you were strangers in the land of Egypt.

10. And you shall sow your land six years, and shall gather in the fruits of it.

11. But the seventh [year] you shall let it rest and lie still, so that the poor of your people may eat. And what they leave, the animals of the field shall eat. In the same way you shall deal with your vineyard [and] with your oliveyard.

12. You shall do your work six days, and on the seventh day you shall rest, so that your ox and your ass may rest, and the son of your handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.

13. And be watchful in all that I have said to you. And make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of your mouth.

14. You shall keep a feast to Me three times in the year.

15. You shall keep the Feast of Unleavened [Bread]. You shall eat unleavened [bread] seven days, as I commanded you, in the time appointed of the month Abib, for in it you came out of Egypt. And no one shall appear before Me empty.

16. Also the Feast of Harvest, the first-fruits of your labors, which you have sown in the field. Also the Feast of Ingathering, in the end of the year, when you have gathered in your labors out of the field.

17. Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord God.

18. You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread, neither shall the fat of My sacrifice remain until the morning.

19. The first of the firstfruits of your land you shall bring [into] the house of the LORD your God. You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.

20. Behold, I send an Angel before you, to keep you in the way, and to bring you to the place which I have prepared.

21. Be on guard before Him, and obey His voice. Do not provoke Him, for He will not pardon your transgressions. For My name [is] in Him.

22. But if you shall indeed obey His voice, and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy to your enemies, and a foe to your foes.

23. For My Angel shall go before you and bring you in to the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. And I will cut them off.

24. You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them. And you shall not do according to their works. But you shall surely pull them down, and surely you shall smash their images.

25. And you shall serve the LORD your God, and He shall bless your bread and your water. And I will take sickness away from the midst of you.

26. Nothing shall cast their young, nor be barren in your land. The number of your days I will fulfill.

27. I will send My fear before you, and will destroy all the people to whom you shall come. And I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you.

28. And I will send hornets before you, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite before you.

29. I will not drive them out from before you in one year, lest the land become a waste, and the beast of the field multiply against you.

30. By little and little I will drive them out from before you, until you have increased, and inherit the land.

31. And I will stretch your bounds from the Red Sea even to the Sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the river. For I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you shall drive them out before you.

32. You shall make no covenant with them or with their gods.

33. They shall not dwell in your land lest they make you sin against Me. For if you serve their gods, it surely will be a snare to you.

## Exodus 24

1. And He said to Moses, Come up to the LORD, you and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel. And bow yourselves afar off.

2. And Moses alone shall come near the LORD, but they shall not come near. Neither shall the people go up with him.

3. And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments. And all the people answered with one voice and said, All the words which the LORD has said, we will do.

4. And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar below the mountain and twelve pillars according to the twelve tribes of Israel.

5. And he sent young men of the sons of Israel who offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of bullocks to the LORD.

6. And Moses took half of the blood, and put [it] in basins, and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

7. And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the ears of the people. And they said, All that the LORD has said we will do, and be obedient.

8. And Moses took the blood and sprinkled [it] on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has made with you concerning all these words.

9. And Moses went up, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel.

10. And they saw the God of Israel. And [there was] under His feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the heavens in clearness.

11. And upon the nobles of the sons of Israel He did not lay his hands. Also they saw God, and ate and drank.

12. And the LORD said to Moses, Come up to Me in the mountain, and be there. And I will give you tablets of stone, and the law, and commandments which I have written, so that you may teach them.

13. And Moses rose up, and his attendant Joshua. And Moses went up into the mountain of God.

14. And he said to the elders, You stay here for us until we come again to you. And behold, Aaron and Hur [are] with you. If any man has any matters to do, let him come to them.

15. And Moses went up into the mountain, and a cloud covered the mountain.

16. And the glory of the LORD abode upon Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And the seventh day He called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud.

17. And the sight of the glory of the LORD [was] like devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the sons of Israel.

18. And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and went up into the mountain. And Moses was in the mountain forty days and forty nights.

23. and one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened [bread] that [is] before the LORD.

24. And you shall put all in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons, and shall wave them [for] a wave offering before the LORD.

25. And you shall take them from their hands, and burn [them] upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savor before the LORD. It is an offering made by fire to the LORD.

27. And you shall sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the thigh of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is lifted from the ram of the consecration, from what [is] Aaron's, and from what is for his sons.

28. And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute forever from the sons of Israel. For it [is] a heave offering. And it shall be a heave offering from the sons of Israel of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, even their heave offering to the LORD.

29. And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed in them and consecrated in them.

30. The one of his sons that is priest in his place shall put them on seven days, when he comes into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy [place].

31. And you shall take the ram of the consecration, and boil its flesh in the holy place.

32. And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram and the bread that [is] in the basket, [by] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

33. And they shall eat those things with which the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them. But a stranger shall not eat because they [are] holy.

34. And if any of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remains until the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire. It shall not be eaten, because it [is] holy.

35. And so you shall do to Aaron and to his sons according to all things which I have commanded you. You shall consecrate them seven days.

36. And you shall offer every day a bull, a sin offering for atonement. And you shall cleanse the altar when you have made an atonement for it, and you shall anoint it to sanctify it.

37. You shall make an atonement for the altar seven days, and sanctify it. And it shall be a most holy altar. Whatever touches the altar shall be holy.

38. And this [is] what you shall offer upon the altar: two lambs of the first year day by day forever.

39. The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer at evening.

40. And with the one lamb a tenth part of flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil, and the fourth part of a hin [of] wine, a drink offering.

41. And you shall offer the other lamb at evening; you shall do to it according to the meal offering of the morning, and according to its drink offering, for a sweet smell, an offering made by fire to the LORD.

42. [This shall be] a burnt offering forever throughout your generations, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD, where I will meet you, to speak there to you.

43. And there I will meet with the sons of Israel, and Israel shall be sanctified by My glory.

44. And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar. I will also sanctify both Aaron and his sons to minister to Me in the priest's office.

45. And I will dwell among the sons of Israel, and will be their God.

46. And they shall know that I [am] the LORD their God, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt so that I may dwell among them. I [am] the LORD their God.

## Exodus 30

1. And you shall make an altar to burn incense upon. You shall make it [of] acacia-wood.

2. A cubit [shall be] its length, and a cubit its breadth. It shall be square. And two cubits [shall be] the height of it, its horns from itself.

3. And you shall overlay it [with] pure gold, its top, and its sides all around, and its horns. And you shall make to it a crown of gold all around.

4. And you shall make two golden rings to it under the crown of it, by the two corners of it, upon the two sides of it you shall make it. And they shall be housings for the staves to bear it with.

5. And you shall make the staves [of] acacia-wood and overlay them [with] gold.

6. And you shall put it before the veil that [is] by the ark of the testimony, in front of the mercy-seat that is beside the testimony, where I will meet with you.

7. And Aaron shall burn sweet incense on it every morning; when he dresses the lamps he shall burn it.

8. And when Aaron lights the lamps at evening, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.

9. You shall offer no strange incense on it, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meal offering. Neither shall you pour drink offering on it.

10. And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offerings of atonement. He shall make atonement on it once in the year throughout your generations. It [is] most holy to the LORD.

11. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

12. When you count the sons of Israel, of those who are to be counted, then they shall each man give a ransom for his soul to the LORD when [you] number them, so that there may be no plague among them when you number them.

13. They shall give this, every one that passes among those who are counted, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary (a shekel [is] twenty gerahs); a half shekel [shall be] the offering of the LORD.

14. Everyone that passes among those who are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering to the LORD.

15. The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than half a shekel, when [they] give an offering to the LORD to make an atonement for your souls.

16. And you shall take the atonement silver of the sons of Israel, and shall appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, so that it may be a memorial to the sons of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.

17. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

18. You shall also make a laver [of] bronze and its foot also of bronze, for washing. And you shall put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar. And you shall put water in it,

19. for Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet there.

20. When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash [with] water so that they do not die. Or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire to the LORD,

21. they shall wash their hands and their feet, so that they do not die. And it shall be a statute forever to them, to him and to his seed throughout their generations.

22. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

23. Take also to you principal spices, five hundred [shekels] of pure myrrh, and half as much of sweet cinnamon, even two hundred and fifty [shekels], and two hundred and fifty shekels of sweet calamus,

24. and five hundred of cassia, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and a hin of olive oil.

25. And you shall make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the perfumer. It shall be a holy anointing oil.

26. And you shall anoint the tabernacle of the congregation with it, and the ark of the testimony,

27. and the table and all its vessels, and the lampstand and its vessels, and the altar of incense,

28. and the altar of burnt offerings with all its vessels, and the laver and its foot.

29. And you shall sanctify them so that they may be most holy. Whatever touches them shall be holy.

30. And you shall anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them, so that [they] may minister to Me in the priest's office.

31. And you shall speak to the sons of Israel saying, This shall be a holy anointing oil to Me throughout your generations.

32. It shall not be poured upon man's flesh, neither shall you make [any other] like it, according to the way it is made. It is holy, and it shall be holy to you.

33. Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts [any] of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.

34. And the LORD said to Moses, Take to yourself sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense, a part of each one.

35. And you shall make it a perfume, an incense according to the art of the perfumer, salted, pure [and] holy.

36. And you shall beat [some] of it very small, and put it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with you. It shall be most holy to you.

37. And the perfume which you shall make, you shall not make any for yourselves according to the way it is made. It shall be holy to you for the LORD.

38. Whoever shall make [any] like that, to smell of it, shall even be cut off from his people.

## Exodus 31

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Behold, I, I have called by name Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.

3. And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all workmanship,

4. to devise designs; to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze,

5. and in cutting of stones, to set [them], and in carving of timber, to work in all workmanship.

6. And behold, I have given to him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. And I have put wisdom in the hearts of all the wise-hearted, so that they may make all that I have commanded you:

7. the tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that [is] upon it, and all the vessels of the tabernacle,

8. and the table and its vessels, and the pure lampstand with all its vessels, and the altar of incense,

9. and the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its base,

10. and the woven garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,

11. and the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy [place]. According to all that I have commanded you, they shall do.

12. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

13. Speak also to the sons of Israel, saying, Truly you shall keep My sabbaths. For it [is] a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, to know that I [am] the LORD who sanctifies you.

14. You shall keep the Sabbath therefore, for it [is] holy to you. Everyone that defiles it shall surely be put to death. For whoever does [any] work in it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

15. Six days may work be done, but on the seventh [is] the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does [any] work in the Sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.

16. Therefore the sons of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, [for] an everlasting covenant.

17. It [is] a sign between Me and the sons of Israel forever. For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He rested, and was refreshed.

18. And He gave to Moses, when He had made an end of speaking with him upon Mount Sinai, two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written by the finger of God.

## Exodus 32

1. And the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, and the people gathered themselves to Aaron. And they said to him, Up! Make us gods who shall go before us. For this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.

2. And Aaron said to them, Break off the golden earrings which [are] in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring [them] to me.

3. And all the people broke off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought [them] to Aaron.

4. And he took [them] from their hand, and fashioned it with an engraving tool. And he made it a molten calf. And they said, These [are] your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.

5. And when Aaron saw, he built an altar before it. And Aaron made proclamation and said, Tomorrow [is] a feast to Jehovah.

6. And they rose up early on the next day and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings. And the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.

7. And the LORD said to Moses, Go! Get down, for your people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt, are corrupted.

8. They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made them a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, These [are] your gods, O Israel, who have brought you up out of the land of Egypt.

9. And the LORD said to Moses, I have seen this people, and behold, it [is] a stiff-necked people.

10. And now leave Me alone, so that My wrath may become hot against them and so that I may consume them. And I will make of you a great nation.

11. And Moses prayed to the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why does Your wrath become hot against Your people whom You have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?

12. Why should the Egyptians speak and say, He brought them out for harm, to kill them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from Your fierce wrath, and be moved to pity as to this evil against Your people.

13. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your own self, and said to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall inherit [it] forever.

14. And the LORD was moved to pity as to the evil which He spoke of doing to His people.

15. And Moses turned, and went down from the mountain, and the two tablets of the testimony [were] in his hand. The tablets were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other.

16. And the tablets [were] the work of God, and the writing [was] the writing of God. It [was] engraved on the tablets.

17. And Joshua heard the voice of the people in their shouting. And he said to Moses, A sound of war in the camp!

18. And he said, [It is] not a sound of a cry of victory, nor a sound of the cry of defeat. I [am] hearing the sound of singing.

19. And it happened, as he came near to the camp and saw the calf and dances, the anger of Moses became hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands, and broke them at the bottom of the mountain.

20. And he took the calf which they had made and burned [it] in the fire, and ground [it] to powder, and dropped [it] upon the water, and made the sons of Israel drink [of it].

21. And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people do to you, that you have brought so great a sin upon them?

22. And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord become hot. You know the people, that they [are set] on mischief.

23. For they said to me, Make us gods who shall go before us. For this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.

24. And I said to them, Whoever has any gold, let them break [it] off. And they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and there came out this calf.

25. And when Moses saw that the people were naked, (for Aaron had made them naked to [their] shame among their enemies,)

26. then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said, Who [is] on the LORD's side? [Come] to me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves to him.

27. And he said to them, Thus says the LORD God of Israel: Each man put his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and kill each one his brother, and each one his neighbor, and each one his kindred.

28. And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. And there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.

29. For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, since each one [has been] against his son, and against his brother, and in order to give you a blessing today.

30. And it happened on the next day, Moses said to the people, You have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to the LORD. Perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin.

31. And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made themselves gods of gold.

32. And now will You forgive their sin! And if not, I pray You, blot me out of Your book which You have written.

33. And the LORD said to Moses, Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book.

34. And now go, lead the people to [the place] of which I have spoken to you. Behold, My Angel shall go before you. And in the day of My visitation I will visit their sin upon them.

35. And the LORD plagued the people because they made the calf, which Aaron made.

## Exodus 33

1. And the LORD said to Moses, Come, go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To your seed I will give it.

2. And I will send an angel before you. And I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite;

3. to a land flowing [with] milk and honey. For I will not go up in the midst of you, for you [are] a stiff-necked people, lest I consume you in the way.

4. And the people heard these evil tidings, and they mourned, and put no ornaments on themselves.

5. And the LORD had said to Moses, Say to the sons of Israel, You [are] a stiff-necked people. I will come up into the midst of you in a moment, and I will consume you. And now put off your ornaments from you, that I may know what to do with you.

6. And the sons of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by Mount Horeb.

7. And Moses took the tabernacle and pitched it outside the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the tabernacle of the congregation. And it happened, everyone who sought the LORD went out to the tabernacle of the congregation, which  was] outside the camp.

8. And it happened as Moses went out to the tabernacle, all the people rose up, and each man stood [at] his tent door and looked after Moses until he had gone into the tabernacle.

9. And it happened as Moses went into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended and stood [at] the door of the tabernacle, and the LORD spoke with Moses.

10. And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand [at] the tabernacle door. And all the people rose up and worshiped, each man in his tent door.

11. And the LORD would speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. And he turned again to the camp. But his servant, Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, did not leave the middle of the tabernacle.

12. And Moses said to the LORD, Behold, You say to me, Bring up this people. And You have not told me whom You will send with me. Yet You have said, I know you by name, and you have also found grace in My sight.

13. Now therefore, I pray You, if I have found grace in Your sight, make me see now Your ways, that I may know You, that I may find grace in Your sight. And consider that this nation [is] Your people.

14. And He said, My presence shall go [with you], and I will give you rest.

15. And he said to Him, If Your presence does not go [with me], do not carry us up from here.

16. For in what shall it be known that I and Your people have found grace in Your sight? [Is it] not in that You go with us? So we shall be separated, I and Your people, from all the people that [are] upon the face of the earth.

17. And the LORD said to Moses, I will do this thing also that you have spoken. For you have found grace in My sight, and I know you by name.

18. And he said, I beseech You, let me see Your glory.

19. And He said, I will make all My goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before you. And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.

20. And He said, You cannot see My face. For there no man can see Me and live.

21. And the LORD said, Behold! [There is] a place by Me, and you shall stand upon a rock.

22. And it will be, while My glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with My hand while I pass by.

23. And I will take away My hand, and you shall see My back parts. But My face shall not be seen.

## Exodus 34

1. And the LORD said to Moses, Cut out two tablets of stone like the first. And I will write upon the tablets the words that were in the first tablets which you broke.

2. And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to Me in the top of the mountain.

3. And no man shall come up with you, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mountain. Also do not let the flocks nor herds feed before that mountain.

4. And he cut out two tablets of stone like the first. And Moses rose up early in the morning and went up to Mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tablets of stone.

5. And the LORD came down in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.

6. And the LORD passed by before him and proclaimed, Jehovah! Jehovah God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,

7. keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and who will by no means clear [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of fathers on the sons, and on the sons of sons, to the third and to the fourth generation.

8. And Moses made haste and bowed toward the earth, and worshiped.

9. And he said, If now I have found grace in Your sight, O LORD, I pray You, let my Lord go among us. For it [is] a stiff-necked people. And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your inheritance.

10. And He said, Behold! I make a covenant. Before all your people I will do marvels such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation. And all the people in whose midst you [are] shall see the work of the LORD, for it  is] an awesome thing that I will do with you.

11. Observe that which I command you this day. Behold! I drive out before you the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

12. Take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the people of the land where you go, lest it be for a snare in the midst of you.

13. But you shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves.

14. For you shall worship no other god. For the LORD, whose name is Jealous, [is] a jealous God;

15. lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice to their gods, and call you, and you eat of his sacrifice;

16. and lest you take from their daughters for your sons, and their daughters go whoring after their gods and make your sons go whoring after their gods.

17. You shall make you no molten gods.

18. You shall keep the Feast of Unleavened [Bread]. You shall eat unleavened [bread] seven days, as I commanded you, in the time of the month Abib. For in the month Abib you came out from Egypt.

19. All that opens the womb [is] Mine; and all yours male livestock, a firstling of ox or sheep.

20. But the firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb. And if you do not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. All the first-born of your sons you shall redeem. And none shall appear before Me empty.

21. You shall work six days, but on the seventh day you shall rest. In plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.

22. And you shall observe the Feast of Weeks, of the first-fruits of wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the year's end.

23. Three times in the year your men shall appear before the Lord God, the God of Israel.

24. For I will cast out the nations before you and enlarge your borders. Neither shall any man desire your land when you shall go up to appear before the LORD your God three times in the year.

25. You shall not slaughter the blood of My sacrifice on leavened [bread]. Neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover be left to the morning.

26. The first of the first-fruits of your land you shall bring to the house of the LORD your God. You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.

27. And the LORD said to Moses, Write these words for yourself; for on the mouth of these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.

28. And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights. He neither ate bread, nor drank water. And He wrote upon the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments.

29. And it happened as Moses was going down from the mountain of Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony being in Moses' hand as he went down from the mountain, Moses did not know that the skin of his face had become luminous through His speaking with him.

30. And Aaron and all the sons of Israel saw Moses, and behold, the skin of his face had become luminous. And they were afraid to come near him.

31. And Moses called to them. And Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him, and Moses talked with them.

32. And afterward all the sons of Israel came near. And he commanded them all that the LORD had spoken with him in Mount Sinai.

33. And Moses finished speaking with them, and he put a veil on his face.

34. But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with Him, he took the veil off until he came out. And he came out and spoke to the sons of Israel that which he was commanded.

35. And the sons of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face had become luminous. And Moses put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with Him.

## Exodus 35

1. And Moses gathered all the congregation of the sons of Israel together and said to them, These [are] the words which the LORD has commanded, to do them.

2. Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD. Whoever does work in it shall be put to death.

3. You shall kindle no fire throughout your living places upon the Sabbath day.

4. And Moses spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel saying, This [is] the thing which the LORD commanded. He said,

5. Take from among you an offering to the LORD. Whoever [is] of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD: gold, and silver, and bronze,

6. and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and bleached [linen], and goats' [hair] ,

7. and rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and acacia-wood,

8. and oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,

9. and onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breast-pocket.

10. And every wise-hearted one among you shall come and make all that the LORD has commanded:

11. the tabernacle, its tent, its covering, its clasps, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets.

12. And make the ark and the staves of it, the mercy-seat, and the veil of the covering,

13. the table, and its staves, and all its vessels, and showbread,

14. also the lampstand for the light, and its vessels, and its lamp, with the oil for the light,

15. and the incense altar, and its staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging of the door at the entering in of the tabernacle.

16. And make the altar of burnt offering, with its bronze grate, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base,

17. the hangings of the court, its pillars and their sockets, and the hanging, for the door of the court,

18. the pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,

19. the woven garments to do service in the holy [place], the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.

20. And all the congregation of the sons of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.

21. And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom His spirit made willing. They brought the LORD's offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all His service, and for the holy garments.

22. And the men came in together with the women, as many as were willing-hearted, bringing bracelets and earrings, and rings and ornaments, all jewels of gold. And everyone who offered waved a wave offering of gold to the LORD.

23. And everyone [with] whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and bleached [linen], and goats' [hair], and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them.

24. Everyone lifting up an offering of silver and bronze brought the LORD's offering. And everyone with whom was found acacia-wood for any work of the service, brought [it].

25. And every wise-hearted woman spun with her hands. And they brought spun yarn, blue, and purple, scarlet, and bleached [linen].

26. And all the women whose hearts were lifted up in wisdom spun goats' hair.

27. And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod and for the breast-pocket.

28. And they brought spice and oil, for the light and for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense.

29. The sons of Israel brought a willing offering to the LORD, every man and woman whose heart made them willing to bring for all kinds of work which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.

30. And Moses said to the sons of Israel, See, the LORD has called the son of Uri the son of Hur, by the name Bezaleel, of the tribe of Judah.

31. And He has filled him with the spirit of God in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all kinds of work,

32. and to devise designs, to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze,

33. and in the cutting of stones to set, and in carving of wood, to make any kind of skillful work.

34. And He has put in his heart that he may teach, he and Aholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.

35. He has filled them [with] wisdom of heart to work all kinds of work; of the smith, and of the skillful worker, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in bleached  linen], and of the weaver, of those who do any work, and of those who work out artful work.

## Exodus 36

1. And Bezaleel and Aholiab shall work with everyone wise of heart to whom the LORD has given wisdom and intelligence, to know how to do every work of the service of the sanctuary, concerning all which the LORD had commanded.

2. And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise-hearted man in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even everyone whose heart stirred him up to come, to do the work.

3. And they received all the offerings from Moses, the offering which the sons of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it. And they still brought to him free offerings every morning.

4. And all the wise men who worked all the work of the sanctuary came, every man from his work which they made.

5. And they spoke to Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough [for] the service of the work which the LORD commanded to make.

6. And Moses commanded, and they caused it to be known throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. And the people were kept from bringing.

7. For the stuff which they had was enough for all the work to make it, and too much.

8. And every wise-hearted one among them that worked the work of the tabernacle, made ten curtains [of] fine twined bleached [linen], and blue, and purple, and scarlet. He made them with cherubs of skillful work.

35. And he made a veil [of] blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined bleached [linen]. He made it the work of an artisan, with cherubs.

36. And he made for it four pillars [of] acacia. And he overlaid them [with] gold. Their hooks [were of] gold, and he cast four sockets of silver for them.

37. And he made a screen for the tabernacle door, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined bleached [linen], of needlework;

2. You shall set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation on the first day of the first month.

3. And you shall put the ark of the testimony in it, and you shall cover the ark with the veil.

4. And you shall bring the table in, and set in order its arrangement. And you shall bring the lampstand in and light the lamps of it.

5. And you shall set the altar of gold for the incense in front of the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.

6. And you shall set the altar of the burnt offering in front of the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

7. And you shall set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shall put water in it.

8. And you shall set up the court all around, and place the screen at the court gate.

9. And you shall take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle, and all in it, and shall sanctify it and all the vessels of it. And it shall be holy.

10. And you shall anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar. And it shall be a most holy altar.

11. And you shall anoint the laver and its base, and sanctify it.

12. And you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.

13. And you shall put the holy garments on Aaron, and anoint him and sanctify him, so that he may minister to Me in the priest's office.

14. And you shall bring his sons and clothe them [with] tunics.

15. And you shall anoint them, even as you anointed their father, so that they may minister to Me in the priest's office. For their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood for their generations.

16. And Moses did so. According to all that the LORD commanded him, so he did.

17. And it will be in the first month in the second year, on the first of the month, the tabernacle was reared up.

18. And Moses reared up the tabernacle and fastened its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and reared up its pillars.

19. And he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent above upon it, even as the LORD commanded Moses.

20. And he took and placed the Testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy-seat on the ark from above.

21. And he brought the ark into the tabernacle and set up the veil of the covering, and covered the Ark of Testimony, even as the LORD commanded Moses.

22. And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, on the side of the tabernacle northward, outside the veil.

23. And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD, even as the LORD had commanded Moses.

24. And he put the lampstand in the tent of the congregation across from the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.

25. And he set up the lamps before the LORD, even as the LORD commanded Moses.

30. And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, for washing.

31. And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet there.

32. When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near the altar, they washed, even as the LORD commanded Moses.

33. And he reared up the court all around the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the court gate. And Moses finished the work.

34. And the cloud covered the tabernacle of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

35. And Moses was not able to enter into the tabernacle of the congregation because the cloud stayed on it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

36. And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the sons of Israel journeyed on in all their journeys.

37. But if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not journey until the day that it was taken up.

38. For the cloud of the LORD [was] upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, in all their journeys.
