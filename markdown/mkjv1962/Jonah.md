# Jonah

## Jonah 1

1. And the Word of Jehovah came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,

2. Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their evil has come up before Me.

3. But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah. And he went down to Joppa. And he found a ship going to Tarshish. And he gave its fare, and went down into it, in order to go with them to Tarshish, away from the sight of Jehovah.

4. But Jehovah hurled a great wind into the sea, and there was a great storm in the sea, so that the ship [was] thought to be broken.

5. Then the seamen were afraid, and each man cried to his god. And they threw out the [ship's] articles in the ship, into the sea in order to lighten [it]. But Jonah had gone down into the hold of the ship; and he lay there, and was fast asleep.

6. And the chief of the seaman came to him and said to him, What [is it] to you, O sound sleeper? Arise, call upon your God! It may be that our god will notice us, and we will not perish.

7. And they said, each one to his fellow, Come and let us cast lots, so that we may know who has caused this evil [to occur] to us. And they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.

8. Then they said to him, Please tell us, for what reason this evil [has come] on us. What is your business? And where do you come from? Where [is] your country? And of what people [are] you?

9. And he said to them, I [am] a Hebrew; and I fear Jehovah, the God of heaven, who has made the sea and the dry land.

10. Then the men were afraid [with] a great fear. And they said to him, What is this you have done? For the men knew that he was fleeing from before the face of Jehovah, because he had told them.

11. Then they said to him, What shall we do to you, that the sea may be calm to us? For the sea was going on and being stormy.

12. And he said to them, Take me up and throw me out into the sea. And the sea shall be calm to you; for I know that this great storm [has come] on you for my sake.

13. But the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not, for the sea was going on and being stormy against them.

14. And they cried to Jehovah and said, We beg You, O Jehovah, we beg You, let us not perish for this man's life, and do not lay on us innocent blood. For You, O Jehovah, have done as it pleased You.

15. And they lifted Jonah up and threw him out into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging.

16. Then the men feared Jehovah exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice to Jehovah, and vowed vows.

17. And Jehovah had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.

## Jonah 2

1. And Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God out of the fish's belly,

2. and he said, I cried to Jehovah from my distress. And He answered me. Out of the belly of Sheol I cried for help, [and] You heard my voice.

3. For You cast me [into the] depths of the seas, and the current surrounded me. All Your breakers and Your waves passed over me.

4. Then I said, I am cast off from Your eyes, yet I will look again toward Your holy temple.

5. Waters encompassed me, [even] to the soul; the depth closed around me; the seaweed was bound to my head.

6. I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was around me forever; yet You have brought up my life from the pit, O Jehovah my God.

7. When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah; and my prayer came in to You, into Your holy temple.

8. They who take heed to lying vanities forsake their kindness;

9. but I will sacrifice to You with the voice of thanksgiving; I will fulfill that which I have vowed. Salvation [belongs] to Jehovah!

10. And Jehovah spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out on the dry land.

## Jonah 3

1. And the Word of Jehovah came to Jonah the second time, saying,

2. Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry out to it the proclamation that I am declaring to you.

3. And Jonah arose and went to Nineveh, according to the Word of Jehovah. And Nineveh was a very great city of three days' journey.

4. And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried and said, Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown!

5. And the people of Nineveh believed God. And they called a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.

6. For word came to the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne. And he laid his robe from him, and covered himself [with] sackcloth, and sat in ashes.

7. And he cried out and said in Nineveh by the decree of the king and his great ones, saying, Do not let man or beast, herd or flock taste anything; do not let them feed, nor drink water.

8. But let man and animal be covered [with] sackcloth, and cry mightily to God. And let them each one turn from his evil way, and from the violence that [is] in their hands.

9. Who knows? He may repent, and God may have pity and turn away from the glow of His anger, so that we do not perish.

10. And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way. And God was compassionate over the evil that He had said to do to them, and He did not do [it].

## Jonah 4

1. But it [was] a great calamity in Jonah's sight, and it kindled [anger] in him.

2. And he prayed to Jehovah and said, Please, O Jehovah, [was] this not my saying when I was still in my land? On account of this I fled before to Tarshish. For I knew that You [are] a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and One who repents over calamity.

3. And now, O Jehovah, I beseech You, take my life from me. For better [is] my death than my life.

4. And Jehovah said, Is anger rightly kindled in you?

5. And Jonah went out of the city and sat on the east of the city. And he made himself a booth there and sat under it in the shade, until he might see what would happen in the city.

6. And Jehovah God prepared a plant, and it came up over Jonah, to be shade over his head, in order to deliver him from his misery. And Jonah rejoiced [with] great joy over the plant.

7. But God prepared a worm as the morning dawned the next day. And it struck the plant, and it withered.

8. And it happened when the sun shone, God ordained a scorching east wind. And the sun beat on the head of Jonah, so that he fainted. And he asked for his life to die. And he said, Better [is] my death than my life.

9. And God said to Jonah, Is your anger rightly kindled over the plant? And he said, My anger is rightly kindled, [even] to death.

10. And Jehovah said, You have had pity on the plant, for which you had not labored, nor made it grow, which was a son of a night, and perished the son of a night.

11. And should I not spare Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than a hundred and twenty thousand men who do not know between [their] right [and their] left hand, besides much cattle?
