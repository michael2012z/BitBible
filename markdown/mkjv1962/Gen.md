# Genesis

## Genesis 1

1. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

2. And the earth was without form and empty. And darkness [was] on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters.

3. And God said, Let there be light. And there was light.

4. And God saw the light that [it was] good. And God divided between the light and the darkness.

5. And God called the light, Day. And He called the darkness, Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

6. And God said, Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters [from] the waters.

7. And God made the expanse, and divided the waters which [were] under the expanse from the waters which [were] above the expanse; and it was so.

8. And God called the expanse, Heavens. And the evening and the morning were the second day.

9. And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so.

10. And God called the dry land, Earth. And He called the gathering together of the waters, Seas. And God saw that [it was] good.

11. And God said, Let the earth bring forth tender sprouts ( the] herb seeding seed [and] the fruit tree producing fruit after its kind, whose seed [is] in itself) upon the earth; and it was so.

12. And the earth brought forth tender sprouts, [the] herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree producing fruit after its kind, whose seed [was] in itself. And God saw that [it was] good.

13. And the evening and the morning were the third day.

14. And God said, Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to divide between the day and the night. And let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years,

15. And let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth. And it was so.

16. And God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day and the smaller light to rule the night, and the stars [also.]

17. And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth,

18. and to rule over the day and over the night; and to divide between the light and the darkness. And God saw that [it was] good.

19. And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

20. And God said, Let the waters swarm [with] swarmers [having] a living soul; and let birds fly over the earth on the face of the expanse of the heavens.

21. And God created great sea-animals, and every living soul that creeps [with] which the waters swarmed after their kind; and every winged fowl after its kind. And God saw that [it was] good.

22. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters of the seas and let the fowl multiply in the earth.

23. And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

24. And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind, cattle, and creepers, and its beasts of the earth after its kind; and it was so.

25. And God made the beasts of the earth after its kind, and cattle after their kind, and all creepers upon the earth after their kind. And God saw that it was good.

26. And God said, Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over all the creepers creeping on the earth.

27. And God created man in His image; in the image of God He created him. He created them male and female.

28. And God blessed them. And God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply and fill the earth, and subdue it. And have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the heavens, and all animals that move upon the earth.

29. And God said, Behold! I have given you every herb seeding seed which [is] upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in which [is the] fruit of a tree seeding seed; to you it shall be for food.

30. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the heavens, and to every creeper on the earth which [has] in it a living soul every green plant [is] for food; and it was so.

31. And God saw everything that He had made, and behold, [it was] very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

## Genesis 2

1. And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.

2. And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made. And He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.

3. And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He had rested from all His work which God created to make.

4. These [are] the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they [were] created in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,

5. and every shrub of the field was not yet on the earth, and every plant of the field had not yet sprung up. For the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and [there was] no man to till the ground.

6. But there went up from the earth a mist and watered all the face of the ground.

7. And the LORD God formed man [of the] dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

8. And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden. And there He put the man whom He had formed.

9. And out of the ground the LORD God caused to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food. The tree of life also was in the middle of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

10. And a river went out of Eden to water the garden. And from there it was divided and became four heads.

11. The name of the first [is] Pishon; that [is it] which surrounds all the land of Havilah, where [there is] gold.

12. And the gold of that land [is] good. There [is] bdellium and the onyx stone.

13. And the name of the second river [is] Gihon; it [is] the one that surrounds the whole land of Cush.

14. And the name of the third river [is] Tigris; it [is] that which goes toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river [is] Euphrates.

15. And the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.

16. And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, You may freely eat of every tree in the garden,

17. but you shall not eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. For in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.

18. And the LORD God said, [It is] not good that the man should be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.

19. And out of the ground the LORD God formed every animal of the field and every fowl of the air, and brought [them] to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called [each] living creature, that [was] its name.

20. And Adam gave names to all the cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of the field. But there was not found a suitable helper for Adam.

21. And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept. And He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh underneath.

22. And the LORD God made the rib (which He had taken from the man) into a woman. And He brought her to the man.

23. And Adam said, This [is] now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. [She] shall be called Woman because [she] was taken out of man.

24. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife and they shall be one flesh.

25. And they were both naked, the man and his wife; and they were not ashamed.

## Genesis 3

1. Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, [Is it] so that God has said, You shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

2. And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden.

3. But of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the middle of the garden, God has said, You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.

4. And the serpent said to the woman, You shall not surely die,

5. for God knows that in the day you eat of it, then your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

6. And when the woman saw that the tree [was] good for food, and that it was pleasing to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make wise, she took of its fruit, and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.

7. And the eyes of both of them were opened. And they knew that they [were] naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made girdles for themselves.

8. And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God in the middle of the trees of the garden.

9. And the LORD God called to Adam and said to him, Where [are] you?

10. And he said, I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I [am] naked, and I hid myself.

11. And He said, Who told you that you [were] naked? Have you eaten of the tree which I commanded you that you should not eat?

12. And the man said, The woman whom You gave [to be] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.

13. And the LORD God said to the woman, What [is] this you have done? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.

14. And the LORD God said to the serpent, Because you have done this you [are] cursed more than all cattle, and more than every animal of the field. You shall go upon your belly, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.

15. And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He will bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel.

16. To the woman He said, I will greatly increase your sorrow and your conception. In pain you shall bear sons, and your desire shall be toward your husband, and he shall rule over you.

17. And to Adam He said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat [of] it! The ground [is] cursed for your sake. In pain shall you eat of it all the days of your life.

18. It shall also bring forth thorns and thistles to you, and you shall eat the herb of the field.

19. In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust you [are], and to dust you shall return.

20. And Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.

21. And for Adam and his wife the LORD God made coats of skins, and clothed them.

22. And the LORD God said, Behold, the man has become as one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever,

23. therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he had been taken.

24. And He drove out the man. And He placed cherubs at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.

## Genesis 4

1. And Adam knew Eve his wife. And she conceived and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

2. And she bore again, his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

3. And in the end of days, it happened, Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground.

4. And Abel also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat of it. And the LORD had respect to Abel and to his offering,

5. but He did not have respect to Cain and to his offering. And Cain glowed with anger, and his face fell.

6. And the LORD said to Cain, Why have you angrily glowed? And why did your face fall?

7. If you do well, shall you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin crouches at the door; and its desire [is] for you, and you shall rule over it.

8. And Cain talked with his brother Abel. And it happened when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him.

9. And the LORD said unto Cain, Where [is] your brother Abel? And he said, I do not know. [Am] I my brother's keeper?

10. And He said, What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries to Me from the ground.

11. And now you [are] cursed more than the ground which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.

12. When you till the ground, it will not again give its strength to you. And you shall be a vagabond and a fugitive in the earth.

13. And Cain said to the LORD, My punishment [is] greater than I can bear.

14. Behold! You have driven me out from the face of the earth today, and I shall be hidden from Your face. And I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth, and it shall be [that] anyone who finds me shall kill me.

15. And the LORD said to him, Therefore whoever kills Cain shall be avenged seven times. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain so that anyone who found him should not kill him.

16. And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD and lived in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

17. And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.

18. And Irad was born to Enoch. And Irad fathered Mehujael. And Mehujael fathered Methusael. And Methusael fathered Lamech.

19. And Lamech took two wives to himself. The name of the first one [was] Adah, and the name of the other [was] Zillah.

20. And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents, and with cattle.

21. And his brother's name [was] Jubal; he was the father of all those playing the harp and the organ.

22. And Zillah also bore Tubalcain, [the] hammerer of every engraving tool of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.

23. And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, wives of Lamech, listen to my speech. For I have killed a man because of my wound, and a young man because of my hurt.

24. For Cain is avenged seven times, and Lamech seventy-seven times.

25. And Adam knew his wife again. And she bore a son, and called his name Seth. For she said, God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain killed him.

26. And there was also a son born to Seth, and he called his name Enos. Then men began to call upon the name of the LORD.

## Genesis 5

1. This [is] the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him in the likeness of God.

2. He created them male and female, and blessed them. And He called their name man in the day when they were created.

3. And Adam lived one hundred and thirty years and fathered [a son] in his own likeness, after his own image. And he called his name Seth.

4. And the days of Adam after he had fathered Seth were eight hundred years. And he fathered sons and daughters.

5. And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years. And he died.

6. And Seth lived one hundred and five years and fathered Enos.

7. And after he fathered Enos, Seth lived eight hundred and seven years. And he fathered sons and daughters.

8. And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years. And he died.

9. And Enos lived ninety years and fathered Cainan.

10. And after he fathered Cainan, Enos lived eight hundred and fifteen years. And he fathered sons and daughters.

11. And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years. And he died.

12. And Cainan lived seventy years and fathered Mahalaleel.

13. And after he fathered Mahalaleel, Cainan lived eight hundred and forty years. And he fathered sons and daughters.

14. And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.

15. And Mahalaleel lived sixty-five years and fathered Jared.

16. And after he fathered Jared, Mahalaleel lived eight hundred and thirty years. And he fathered sons and daughters.

17. And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred and ninety-five years. And he died.

18. And Jared lived one hundred and sixty-two years and fathered Enoch.

19. And after he fathered Enoch, Jared lived eight hundred years. And he fathered sons and daughters.

20. And all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years. And he died.

21. And Enoch lived sixty-five years and fathered Methuselah.

22. And Enoch walked with God three hundred years after he fathered Methuselah. And he fathered sons and daughters.

23. And all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.

24. And Enoch walked with God, and then he [was] not, for God took him.

25. And Methuselah lived one hundred and eighty-seven years and fathered Lamech.

26. And after he fathered Lamech, Methuselah lived seven hundred and eighty-two years. And he fathered sons and daughters.

27. And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty-nine years. And he died.

28. And Lamech lived one hundred and eighty-two years and fathered a son.

29. And he called his name Noah, saying, This one shall comfort us concerning our work and the toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD has cursed.

30. And after he fathered Noah, Lamech lived five hundred and ninety-five years. And he fathered sons and daughters.

31. And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years. And he died.

32. And Noah was five hundred years old. And Noah fathered Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

## Genesis 6

1. And it happened, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and when daughters were born to them,

2. the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they [were] good. And they took wives for themselves from all whom they chose.

3. And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, in his erring; he is flesh. Yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.

4. There were giants in the earth in those days. And also after that, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore to them, they were mighty men who [existed] of old, men of renown.

5. And the LORD saw that the wickedness of man [was] great in the earth, and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart [was] only evil continually.

6. And the LORD repented that He had made man on the earth, and He [was] angry to His heart.

7. And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created, from the face of the earth, both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air. For I repent that I have made them.

8. But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.

9. These [are] the generations of Noah. Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations. Noah walked with God.

10. And Noah fathered three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

11. The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.

12. And God looked upon the earth. And, behold, it was corrupted! For all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth.

13. And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with violence through them. And, behold, I will destroy them [with] the earth.

14. Make an ark of cyprus timbers. You shall make rooms in the ark. And you shall pitch it inside and outside with pitch.

15. And this [is] the way you shall make it. The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it shall be fifty cubits and its height thirty cubits.

16. You shall make a window in the ark, and you shall finish it above to a cubit. And you shall set the door of the ark in the side of it. You shall make it with lower, second and third stories.

17. And behold! I, even I, am bringing a flood of waters upon the earth in order to destroy all flesh (in which [is] the breath of life) from under the heavens. Everything which [is] in the earth shall die.

18. But I will establish My covenant with you. And you shall come into the ark, you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you.

19. And you shall bring into the ark two of every [kind], of every living thing of all flesh, to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female.

20. Two of every kind shall come to you to keep [them] alive; of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after its kind.

21. And take for yourself all food that is eaten, and you shall gather for yourself. And it shall be for food, for you and for them.

22. Noah did so, according to all that God commanded him, so he did.

## Genesis 7

1. And the LORD said to Noah, You and all your house come into the ark, for I have seen you righteous before Me in this generation.

2. You shall take with you every clean animal by sevens, the male and female. And take two of the animals that [are] not clean, the male and female.

3. Also take of the fowls of the air by sevens, the male and the female, to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.

4. For in seven more days I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights. And I will destroy from off the face of the earth every living thing that I have made.

5. And Noah did according to all that the LORD commanded him.

6. And Noah [was] six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.

7. And Noah went in. And his sons and his wife and his sons' wives went in with him into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.

8. Of the clean animals, and of the animals that were not clean, and of the fowls, and of everything that creeps on the earth,

9. two [by] two they went in to Noah into the ark, male and female, as God had commanded Noah.

10. And it happened after seven days that the waters of the flood came into being on the earth.

11. In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, in the seventeenth day of the month, in this day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of the heavens were opened up.

12. And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

13. In this same day, Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, entered into the ark.

14. They went in, and every animal after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth after its kind, and every fowl after its kind, every bird of every sort.

15. And they went in to Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, in which is the breath of life.

16. And they that entered, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him. And the LORD shut him in.

17. And the flood was upon the earth forty days. And the waters increased and bore up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth.

18. And the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth. And the ark floated upon the face of the waters.

19. And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth. And all the high hills that [were] under the whole heaven were covered.

20. The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the mountains were covered.

21. And all flesh that moved upon the face of the earth died, of birds, of cattle, of animal, and of every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth; and every man,

22. all who breathed the breath of life, of all that [was] in the dry land, died.

23. And every living thing which was on the face of the earth was destroyed, from man to cattle, and to the creeping things, and the fowls of the heavens. And they were destroyed from the earth, and only Noah was left, and those that were with him in the ark.

24. And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.

## Genesis 8

1. And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle which [were] with him in the ark. And God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.

2. Also the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and rain from heaven was restrained.

3. And the waters returned from off the earth continually. And after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters had gone down.

4. And in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark rested upon the mountains of Ararat.

5. And the waters decreased continually until the tenth [month]. And the tops of the mountains were seen in the tenth [month] on the first [day] of the month.

6. And it happened, at the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made.

7. And he sent forth a raven, and it went out, going out and returning until the waters were dried up from off the earth.

8. He also sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had gone down from off the face of the earth.

9. But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot. And she returned to him into the ark, for the waters [were] on the face of the whole earth. Then he put out his hand and took her, and pulled her in to him into the ark.

10. And he waited yet another seven days. And again he sent forth the dove out of the ark.

11. And the dove came in to him in the evening. And, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off. So Noah knew that the waters had gone down from off the earth.

12. And he waited yet another seven days, and sent forth the dove. And she did not return again to him any more.

13. And it happened in the six hundred and first year, at the beginning, on the first of the month, that the waters were dried up from off the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked. And, behold, the face of the earth was dried!

14. And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.

15. And God spoke to Noah, saying,

16. Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons' wives with you.

17. Bring out with you every living thing that is with you, of all flesh, of fowl, of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth, so that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth.

18. And Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him.

19. Every animal, every fowl, and every creeping thing, all which creeps upon the earth after their families, went forth out of the ark.

20. And Noah built an altar to the LORD. And he took of every clean animal, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.

21. And the LORD smelled a sweet odor. And the LORD said in His heart, I will never again curse the ground for man's sake, because the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth. And I will not again smite every living thing as I have done.

22. While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.

## Genesis 9

1. And God blessed Noah and his sons. And He said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.

2. And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon the animals of the earth, and upon every bird of the air, upon all that moves on the earth, and upon all the fish of the sea. Into your hand they are delivered.

3. Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. I have given you all things, even as the green herb.

4. But you shall not eat of flesh with the life in it, [or] the blood of it.

5. and surely the blood of your lives will I require. At the hand of every animal will I require it, and at the hand of man. At the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.

6. Whoever sheds man's blood, his blood shall be shed by man; for He made man in the image of God.

7. And you be fruitful and multiply. Bring forth abundantly in the earth, and increase in it.

8. And God spoke to Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

9. Behold! I, even I, establish My covenant with you, and with your seed after you;

10. and with every living creature that [is] with you, of the birds, of the cattle, and of every animal of the earth with you; from all that go out from the ark, to every animal of the earth.

11. And I will establish My covenant with you. Neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood. Neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.

12. And God said, This [is] the token of the covenant which I make between Me and you and every living creature with you, for everlasting generations:

13. I set my rainbow in the cloud. And it shall be a token of a covenant between Me and the earth.

14. And it shall be, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow shall be seen in the cloud.

15. And I will remember My covenant which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

16. And the rainbow shall be in the cloud. And I will look upon it that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.

17. And God said to Noah, This [is] the token of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that [is] upon the earth.

18. And the sons of Noah that went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And Ham is the father of Canaan.

19. These [are] the three sons of Noah, and the whole earth was overspread from them.

20. And Noah began [to be] a husbandman. And he planted a vineyard.

21. And he drank of the wine and was drunk. And he was uncovered inside his tent.

22. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.

23. And Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders. And they went backwards and covered the nakedness of their father. And their faces were backwards, and they did not see their father's nakedness.

24. And Noah awoke from his wine, and came to know what his younger son had done to him.

25. And he said, Cursed [be] Canaan. He shall be a servant of servants to his brothers.

26. And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem, and Canaan shall be his servant.

27. God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem. And Canaan shall be their servant.

28. And Noah lived three hundred and fifty years after the flood.

29. And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years. And he died.

## Genesis 10

1. Now these are [the] generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And sons were born to them after the flood.

2. The sons of Japheth: Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal and Meshech and Tiras.

3. And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah.

4. And the sons of Javan: Elishah and Tarshish and Kittim and Dodanim.

5. By these were the coasts of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.

6. And the sons of Ham: Cush and Mizraim and Phut and Canaan.

7. And the sons of Cush: Seba and Havilah and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabtecha. And the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.

8. And Cush fathered Nimrod. He began to be a mighty one in the earth.

9. He was a mighty hunter before the LORD. Therefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.

10. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

11. Out of that land he went forth [to] Assyria. And he built Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,

12. and Resen between Nineveh and Calah, which [is] a great city.

13. And Mizraim fathered Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim and Naphtuhim,

14. and Pathrusim and Casluhim (from whom came the Philistines) and Caphtorim.

15. And Canaan fathered Sidon, his first-born, and Heth,

16. and the Jebusite and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,

17. and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,

18. and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. And afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad.

19. And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon (as you come to Gerar) to Gaza, as you go in towards Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboim, even to Lasha.

20. These [were] the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.

21. And to Shem were born, even him, the father of all the sons of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder.

22. The sons of Shem: Elam and Asshur and Arpachshad and Lud and Aram.

23. And the sons of Aram: Uz and Hul and Gether and Mash,

24. And Arpachshad fathered Salah; and Salah fathered Eber.

25. And two sons were born to Eber. The name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided. And his brother's name [was] Joktan.

26. And Joktan fathered Almodad and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth and Jerah,

27. and Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah,

28. and Obal and Abimael and Sheba,

29. and Ophir and Havilah, and Jobab. All these [were] the sons of Joktan.

30. And their dwelling was from Mesha, as you go to Sephar, a mountain of the east.

31. These [are] the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, and after their nations.

32. These [are] the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations. And from these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.

## Genesis 11

1. And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.

2. And it happened, as they traveled from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar. And they lived there.

3. And they said to one another, Come, let us make brick and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and they had asphalt for mortar.

4. And they said, Come, let us build us a city and a tower, and its top in the heavens. And let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered upon the face of the whole earth.

5. And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of Adam had built.

6. And the LORD said, Behold! The people [is] one and they all have one language. And this they begin to do. And now nothing which they have imagined to do will be restrained from them.

7. Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, so that they cannot understand one another's speech.

8. So the LORD scattered them abroad from that place upon the face of all the earth. And they quit building the city.

9. Therefore the name of it is called Babel; because the LORD confused the language of all the earth there. And from there the LORD scattered them abroad on the face of all the earth.

10. These are the generations of Shem. Shem [was] a hundred years old and fathered Arpachshad two years after the flood.

11. And after he fathered Arpachshad, Shem lived five hundred years. And he fathered sons and daughters.

12. And Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and fathered Salah.

13. And after he fathered Salah, Arpachshad lived four hundred and three years. And he fathered sons and daughters.

14. And Salah lived thirty years and fathered Eber.

15. And after he fathered Eber, Salah lived four hundred and three years. And he fathered sons and daughters.

16. And Eber lived thirty-four years and fathered Peleg.

17. And after he fathered Peleg, Eber lived four hundred and thirty years. And he fathered sons and daughters.

18. And Peleg lived thirty years and fathered Reu.

19. After he fathered Reu, Peleg lived two hundred and nine years. And he fathered sons and daughters.

20. And Reu lived thirty-two years and fathered Serug.

21. And after he fathered Serug, Reu lived two hundred and seven years. And he fathered sons and daughters.

22. And Serug lived thirty years and fathered Nahor.

23. And after he fathered Nahor, Serug lived two hundred years. And he fathered sons and daughters.

24. And Nahor lived twenty-nine years and fathered Terah.

25. And after he fathered Terah, Nahor lived a hundred and nineteen years. And he fathered sons and daughters.

26. And Terah lived seventy years and fathered Abram, Nahor and Haran.

27. Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah fathered Abram, Nahor and Haran. And Haran fathered Lot.

28. And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans.

29. And Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai. And the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

30. But Sarai was barren. She had no child.

31. And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot, the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife. And he went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan. And they came to Haran and lived there.

32. And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years. And Terah died in Haran.

## Genesis 12

1. And the LORD said to Abram, Go out of your country, and from your kindred, and from your father's house into a land that I will show you.

2. And I will make you a great nation. And I will bless you and make your name great. And you shall be a blessing.

3. And I will bless those that bless you and curse the one who curses you. And in you shall all families of the earth be blessed.

4. And Abram departed, even as the LORD had spoken to him. And Lot went with him. And Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.

5. And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gained in Haran. And they went forth to go into the land of Canaan. And they came into the land of Canaan.

6. And Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, unto the Oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite [was] then in the land.

7. And the LORD appeared to Abram and said, I will give this land to your seed. And he built an altar there to the LORD who appeared to him.

8. And he moved from there to a mountain on the east of Bethel. And he pitched his tent [with] Bethel toward the sea and Hai on the east. And he built an altar there to the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.

9. And Abram journeyed, going on and pulled up [stakes] toward the south.

10. And there was a famine in the land. And Abram went down into Egypt to stay there, for the famine [was] grievous in the land.

11. And it happened, when he had come near to enter into Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look upon.

12. And it will be when the Egyptians see you, they shall say, This [is] his wife. And they will kill me, but they will save you alive.

13. I pray you, say that you [are] my sister, so that it may be well with me for your sake. And my soul shall live because of you.

14. And it happened when Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman [was] very beautiful.

15. The princes of Pharaoh also saw her and commended her before Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

16. And he treated Abram well for her sake. And he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and male servants, and maidservants, and she-asses, and camels.

17. And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife.

18. And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What [is] this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she [is] your wife?

19. Why did you say, She [is] my sister? And so I was about to take her to me as wife. Now therefore behold your wife. Take [her] and go.

20. And Pharaoh commanded men concerning him. And they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.

## Genesis 13

1. And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, (and Lot was with him) into the south.

2. And Abram [was] very rich in cattle, in silver and in gold.

3. And he went on his journeys from the south, even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been from the beginning, between Bethel and Hai,

4. to the place of the altar which he had made there at the first. And Abram called on the name of the LORD there.

5. And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents.

6. And the land was not able to bear them, that they might live together. For their substance was great, so that they could not live together.

7. And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle. And the Canaanite and the Perizzite lived then in the land.

8. And Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray you, between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we [are] men, brothers.

9. [Is] not the whole land before you? I pray you, separate yourself from me. If [you go] to the left, then I will go to the right. Or if [you go] to the right, then I will go to the left.

10. And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the circuit of Jordan, that it [was] all well watered (before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah,) like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt as you come to Zoar.

11. And Lot chose all the circuit of Jordan for himself. And Lot journeyed east; and they separated themselves from one another.

12. Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the circuit and pitched [his] tent toward Sodom.

13. But the men of Sodom [were] wicked and sinners before the LORD, exceedingly so.

14. And after Lot was separated from him, the LORD said to Abram, Lift up your eyes now and look from the place where you are northward and southward, and eastward and westward.

15. For all the land which you see I will give to you, and to your seed forever.

16. And I will make your seed as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can count the dust of the earth, then shall your seed also be counted.

17. Rise up and walk through the land, in the length of it and in the breadth of it, for I will give it to you.

18. And Abram moved [his] tent and came and lived in the oaks of Mamre, which [is] in Hebron. And he built an altar to the LORD there.

## Genesis 14

1. And it happened in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations,

2. they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.

3. All these were joined together in the valley of Siddim, which is the Salt Sea.

4. They served Chedorlaomer twelve years, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.

5. And in the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him came and struck the giants in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,

6. and the Horites in their Mount Seir, as far as the oak of Paran, which is [by] the wilderness.

7. And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and struck all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who lived in Hazazon-tamar.

8. And the king of Sodom went out, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboim, and the king of Bela (which [is] Zoar). And they joined battle with them in the valley of Siddim;

9. with Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal the king of nations, and Amraphel the king of Shinar, and Arioch the king of Ellasar, four kings with five.

10. And the valley of Siddim [was] full of asphalt pits. And the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.

11. And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way.

12. And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who lived in Sodom, and all his goods, and went away.

13. And there came one who had escaped. And he told Abram the Hebrew, for he lived in the plains of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner. And these had a covenant with Abram.

14. And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his trained servants, born in his own house (three hundred and eighteen) and pursued them to Dan.

15. And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants. And he struck them, and pursued them to Hobah, which [is] on the left of Damascus.

16. And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot and his goods, and the women also, and the people.

17. And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and of the kings with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which [is] the king's valley.

18. And Melchizedek the king of Salem brought forth bread and wine. And he [was] the priest of the most high God.

19. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed [be] Abram of the most high God, possessor of Heaven and earth.

20. And blessed [be] the most high God, who has delivered your enemies into your hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

21. And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the people and take the goods for yourself.

22. And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand to the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of Heaven and earth,

23. that I will take from all that is yours, [not] from a thread even to a shoestring, lest you say, I have made Abram rich.

24. Nothing for me, only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.

## Genesis 15

1. After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram, I [am] your shield and your exceeding great reward.

2. And Abram said, Lord God, what will You give me, since I [am] going childless, and the steward of my house [is] this Eliezer of Damascus?

3. And Abram said, Behold, You have given no seed to me. And behold, one born in my house is my heir.

4. And behold, the word of the LORD [came] to him saying, This one shall not be your heir. But he that shall come forth out of your own bowels shall be your heir.

5. And He brought him outside and said, Look now toward the heavens and count the stars, if you are able to count them. And He said to him, So shall your seed be.

6. And he believed in the LORD. And He counted it to him for righteousness.

7. And He said to him, I [am] the LORD that brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it.

8. And he said, Lord God, by what shall I know that I shall inherit it?

9. And He said to him, Take Me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.

10. And he took all these to himself, and divided them in the middle, and laid each piece against one another; but he did not divide the birds.

11. And when the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, Abram drove them away.

12. And it happened as the sun was setting, and a deep sleep fell upon Abram. And, behold, a horror of great darkness fell upon him!

13. And He said to Abram, You must surely know that your seed shall be a stranger in a land not theirs, and shall serve them. And they shall afflict them four hundred years.

14. And also I will judge that nation whom they shall serve. And afterward they shall come out with great substance.

15. And you shall go to your fathers in peace. You shall be buried in a good old age.

16. But in the fourth generation they shall come here again, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.

17. And it happened, the sun went down, and it was dark [and] behold, a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp passed between those pieces.

18. In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, I have given this land to your seed, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates,

19. the Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,

20. and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the giants,

21. and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.

## Genesis 16

1. Now Sarai, Abram's wife, did not bear. And she had a female slave, an Egyptian, and her name [was] Hagar.

2. And Sarai said to Abram, Behold now, the LORD has kept me from bearing. I pray you, go in to my slave woman. It may be that I may be built by her. And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.

3. And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar her slave woman, the Egyptian, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife (after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan).

4. And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

5. And Sarai said to Abram, My wrong [be] upon you. I have given my slave woman into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. The LORD judge between me and you.

6. But Abram said to Sarai, Behold, your slave woman [is] in your hand. Do to her as it pleases you. And Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her face.

7. And the Angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.

8. And He said, Hagar, Sarai's slave, where did you come from? and where will you go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.

9. And the Angel of the LORD said to her, Return to your mistress and submit yourself under her hands.

10. And the Angel of the LORD said to her, I will multiply your seed exceedingly, so that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

11. And the Angel of the LORD said to her, Behold, you are with child, and shall bear a son. And you shall call his name Ishmael, because the LORD has heard your affliction.

12. And he will be a wild man. His hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him. And he shall live in the presence of all his brothers.

13. And she called the name of the LORD who had spoken to her, You [are] a God of vision! For she said, Even here have I looked after Him that sees me?

14. Therefore the well was called The Well of the Living One Seeing Me. Behold, [it is] between Kadesh and Bered.

15. And Hagar bore Abram a son. And Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bore, Ishmael.

16. And Abram [was] eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.

## Genesis 17

1. And when Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, I [am] the Almighty God! Walk before Me and be perfect.

2. And I will make My covenant between Me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.

3. And Abram fell on his face. And God talked with him, saying,

4. As for Me, behold! My covenant is with you, and you shall be a father of many nations.

5. Neither shall your name any more be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham. For I have made you a father of many nations.

6. And I will make you exceedingly fruitful, greatly so, and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come out of you.

7. And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your seed after you in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you and to your seed after you.

8. And I will give the land to you in which you are a stranger, and to your seed after you, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession. And I will be their God.

9. And God said to Abraham, And you shall keep My covenant, you and your seed after you in their generations.

10. This is My covenant, which you shall keep, between Me and you and your seed after you. Every male child among you shall be circumcised.

11. And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin. And it shall be a token of the covenant between Me and you.

12. And a son of eight days shall be circumcised among you, every male child in your generations; he that is born in the house, or bought with silver of any stranger who [is] not of your seed.

13. He that is born in your house, and he that is bought with your silver, must be circumcised. And My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.

14. And the uncircumcised male child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.

15. And God said to Abraham, As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but her name [shall be] Sarah.

16. And I will bless her, and give you a son also of her. Yes, I will bless her, and she shall be [a mother] of nations, kings of people shall be from her.

17. And Abraham fell upon his face and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall [a child] be born to him that is a hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear?

18. And Abraham said to God, Oh that Ishmael might live before You!

19. And God said, Sarah your wife shall bear you a son indeed. And you shall call his name Isaac. And I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.

20. And as for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall father twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation.

21. But I will establish My covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this set time in the next year.

22. And He left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.

23. And Abraham took his son Ishmael, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his silver; every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskins in the same day, even as God said to him.

24. And Abraham [was] ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

25. And his son Ishmael [was] thirteen years old [when] he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

26. In the same day Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised.

27. And all the men of his house, that were born in the house, and bought with silver of the stranger, were circumcised with him.

## Genesis 18

1. And the LORD appeared to him in the plains of Mamre, and he sat at the tent door in the heat of the day.

2. And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and lo, three men stood by him. And when he saw [them], he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed toward the ground.

3. And he said, My Lord, if now I have found favor in Your sight, do not pass away, I pray, from Your servant.

4. Let a little water, I pray, be brought, and wash Your feet, and rest under the tree.

5. And I will bring a bite of bread, and will comfort your hearts. After that You shall pass on. For this is why You have come to Your servant. And they said, Do so, as you have said.

6. And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, [Make ready] quickly three measures of fine meal; knead [it], and make cakes.

7. And Abraham ran out to the herd and brought a calf, tender and good. And he gave [it] to a young man. And he hurried to dress it.

8. And he took butter and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set [it] before them. And he stood by them under the tree, and they ate.

9. And they said to him, Where [is] Sarah your wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.

10. And He said, I will certainly return to you according to the time of life, and lo, Sarah your wife [shall have] a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door which was behind Him.

11. Now Abraham and Sarah [were] old, far gone in days, and it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

12. Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After my being old, shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?

13. And the LORD said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I, who am old, truly bear a child?

14. Is anything too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return again, according to the time of life, and Sarah [shall have] a son.

15. Then Sarah denied, saying, I did not laugh; for she was afraid. And He said, No, but you did laugh.

16. And the men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom. And Abraham was going with them to bring them on the way.

17. And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham the thing which I do,

18. And Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the persons of the earth shall be blessed in him?

19. For I know him, that he will command his sons and his house after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment, that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which He has spoken of him.

20. And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous,

21. I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which has come to Me. And if not, I will know.

22. And the men turned their faces away from there, and went toward Sodom. But Abraham still stood before the LORD.

23. And Abraham drew near and said, Will You also destroy the righteous with the wicked?

24. Perhaps there are fifty righteous within the city. Will You also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are in it?

25. Far be it from You to act in this manner, to kill the righteous with the wicked. And far be it from You, that the righteous should be as the wicked. Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?

26. And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

27. And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak to the LORD, who am but dust and ashes.

28. Perhaps there will be five lacking from the fifty righteous. Will You destroy all the city for lack of five? And He said, If I find there forty-five, I will not destroy [it].

29. And he spoke to Him yet again, and said, Perhaps there shall be forty found there. And He said, I will not do [it] for forty's sake.

30. And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak. Perhaps there shall be thirty found there. And He said, I will not do [it] if I find thirty there.

31. And he said, Lo now, I have taken upon me to speak to the LORD. Perhaps there shall be twenty found there. And He said, I will not destroy [it] for twenty's sake.

32. And he said, Oh do not let the LORD be angry, and I will speak only once more. Perhaps ten shall be found there. And He said, I will not destroy [it] for ten's sake.

33. And the LORD went His way as soon as He had left off talking with Abraham. And Abraham returned to his place.

## Genesis 19

1. And there came two angels to Sodom at evening. And Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. And Lot rose up to meet them when he saw [them]. And he bowed himself with his face toward the ground,

2. and said, Behold now, my lords, please turn into your servant's house and stay all night, and wash your feet, and [you shall] rise up early and go your way. And they said, No, but we will stay in the street.

3. But he urgently pressed on them, and they turned in to him and entered into his house. And he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.

4. But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both old and young, all the people from every quarter.

5. And they called to Lot, and said to him, Where are the men which came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may know them.

6. And Lot went out to the door to them, and shut the door after him.

7. And he said, I pray you, brothers, do not act evilly.

8. Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man. I pray you, let me bring them out to you, and you do to them as you see fit. But do nothing to these men, for this is why they came under the shadow of my roof.

9. And they said, Stand back! And they said, This one came in to stay, and must he judge always? Now we will deal worse with you than with them. And they pressed hard upon the man, Lot, and came near to breaking the door.

10. But the men put out their hands and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.

11. And they smote the men that [were] at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.

12. And the men said to Lot, Have you anyone here besides yourself? Bring your sons-in-law, and your sons, and your daughters, and whatever [you have] in the city, bring [them] out of this place.

13. For we will destroy this place because great is the cry of them before the face of the LORD. And the LORD has sent us to destroy it.

14. And Lot went out and spoke with his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said, Get up and get out of this place, for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked to his sons-in-law.

15. And when the dawn rose up, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, Rise up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

16. And he lingered, the angel laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters (the LORD being merciful to him), and they brought him forth and set him outside the city.

17. And it happened when they brought him outside, He said, Escape for your life! Do not look behind you, nor stay in all the plain. Escape to the mountain lest you be consumed.

18. And Lot said to them, Oh no, Lord,

19. behold now, Your servant has found grace in Your sight, and You have magnified Your mercy, which You have shown to me in saving my life. And I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me and I die.

20. Behold now, this city [is] near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.

21. And He said to him, See, I have accepted you concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city for which you have spoken.

22. Hurry and escape there! For I cannot do anything till you have come there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

23. The sun had risen upon the earth, and Lot entered into Zoar.

24. Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire, from the LORD out of the heavens.

25. And He overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.

26. But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.

27. And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD.

28. And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the lands of the plain, and saw, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.

29. And when God destroyed the cities of the plain, it happened that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.

30. And Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him. For he feared to live in Zoar, and he and his two daughters lived in a cave.

31. And the first-born said to the younger, Our father [is] old, and [there is] no man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth.

32. Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, so that we may preserve seed of our father.

33. And they made their father drink wine that night. And the first-born went in, and lay with her father. And he did not notice when she lay down nor when she arose.

34. And it happened on the next day, the first-born said to the younger, Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine this night also, and you go in and lie down with him so that we may preserve seed of our father.

35. And they made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger arose and lay with him. And he did not notice when she lay down nor when she arose.

36. So both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father.

37. And the first-born bore a son, and called his name Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day.

38. And the younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi; he is the father of the sons of Ammon to this day.

## Genesis 20

1. And Abraham moved from there toward the south country, and lived between Kadesh and Shur, and stayed in Gerar.

2. And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister. And Abimelech the king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.

3. But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, you [are] about to die, for the woman whom you have taken; for she is a man's wife.

4. But Abimelech had not come near her. And he said, Lord, will You also kill a righteous nation?

5. Did he not say to me, She [is] my sister? And she, even she herself said, He [is] my brother. In the sincerity of my heart and innocency of my hands I have done this.

6. And God said to him in a dream, Yes, I know that you did this in the sincerity of your heart. For I also withheld you from sinning against Me. Therefore I did not allow you to touch her.

7. Now therefore, restore his wife to the man. For he [is] a prophet, and he shall pray for you, and you shall live. And if you do not restore her, know that you shall surely die, you, and all that are yours.

8. And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears. And the men were greatly afraid.

9. Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, What have you done to us? In what have I offended you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done.

10. And Abimelech said to Abraham, What did you see that you have done this thing?

11. And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God [is] not in this place, and they will kill me for my wife's sake.

12. And yet truly [she is] my sister. She [is] the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother. And she became my wife.

13. And it happened when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, This [is] your kindness which you show to me, at every place where we shall come, say of me, He [is] my brother.

14. And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and men-servants and women-servants, and gave [them] to Abraham. And he restored him Sarah his wife.

15. And Abimelech said, Behold, my land [is] before you. Live where it pleases you.

16. And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, he [is] to you a covering of the eyes, to all that [are] with you, and with all this, you are justified.

17. And Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his slave women, and they gave birth.

18. For the Lord had closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.

## Genesis 21

1. And the LORD visited Sarah as He had said. And the LORD did to Sarah as He had spoken.

2. For Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.

3. And Abraham called the name of his son that was born to him (whom Sarah bore to him) Isaac.

4. And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.

5. And Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.

6. And Sarah said, God has made me laugh, so that all who hear will laugh with me.

7. And she said, Who could have said to Abraham, will Sarah suckle children? For I have borne a son to him in his old age.

8. And the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham made a great feast the day that Isaac was weaned.

9. And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian (whom she had borne to Abraham) mocking.

10. And she said to Abraham, Cast out this slave woman and her son. For the son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son, with Isaac.

11. And the thing was very evil in Abraham's sight, because of his son.

12. And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in your sight because of the boy and because of your slave woman. In all that Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice. For in Isaac your Seed shall be called.

13. And also, I will make a nation of the son of the slave woman, because he [is] your seed.

14. And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave [it] to Hagar, putting [it] on her shoulder. And he gave her the boy, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.

15. And the water was gone in the bottle, and she cast the boy under one of the shrubs.

16. And she went and sat down across from him, a good way off, about a bowshot. For she said, Let me not see the death of the boy. And she sat across from him, and lifted up her voice, and cried.

17. And God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar out of the heavens, and said to her, What ails you, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.

18. Rise up, lift up the boy and hold him up with your hand, for I will make him a great nation.

19. And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the bottle with water, and gave drink to the boy.

20. And God was with the boy, and he grew, and lived in the wilderness, and became an archer.

21. And he lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.

22. And it happened at that time, Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with you in all that you do.

23. Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son. Do to me according to the kindness that I have sworn to you, and to the land in which you have lived.

24. And Abraham said, I will swear.

25. And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.

26. And Abimelech said, I do not know who has done this thing, neither did you tell me, neither have I even heard of it, except today.

27. And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and both of them made a covenant.

28. And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

29. And Abimelech said to Abraham, What are these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves?

30. And he said, For you shall take [these] seven ewe lambs from my hand, so that they may be a witness to me that I have dug this well.

31. This is why he called that place Beer-sheba, because they swore, both of them, there.

32. So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, rose up. And they returned to the land of the Philistines.

33. And Abraham planted a tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.

34. And Abraham lived in the Philistines' land many days.

## Genesis 22

1. And it happened after these things that God tested Abraham, and said to him, Abraham! And he said, Behold me.

2. And He said, Take now your son, your only one, Isaac, whom you love. And go into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will name to you.

3. And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two [of] his young men with him, and Isaac his son. And he split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up and went to the place of which God had told him.

4. Then on the third day, Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off.

5. And Abraham said to his young men, You stay here with the ass. And I and the boy will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.

6. And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. And he took the fire in his hand, and a knife. And they both went together.

7. And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, My father. And he said, Here [am] I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood. But where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

8. And Abraham said, My son, God will provide Himself a lamb for a burnt offering. So they both went together.

9. And they came to the place which God had told him of. And Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order. And he bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on the wood.

10. And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.

11. And the Angel of Jehovah called to him from the heavens and said, Abraham! Abraham! And he said, Here [am] I.

12. And He said, Do not lay your hand on the lad, nor do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only one, from Me.

13. And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked. And, behold, a ram behind [him] was entangled in a thicket by its horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up for a burnt offering instead of his son.

14. And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Will See; so that it is said [until] this day, In the mount of Jehovah it will be seen.

15. And the Angel of the LORD called to Abraham out of the heavens the second time,

16. and said, I have sworn by Myself, says the LORD; because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only one;

17. that in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your seed like the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is upon the seashore. And your Seed shall possess the gate of His enemies.

18. And in your Seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.

19. Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba. And Abraham lived at Beer-sheba.

20. And it happened after these things that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold Milcah! She also has borne children to your brother Nahor:

21. Huz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,

22. and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.

23. And Bethuel fathered Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother.

24. And his concubine, named Reumah, she also bore Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.

## Genesis 23

1. And Sarah was a hundred twenty seven years old, the years of the life of Sarah.

2. And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same [is] Hebron in the land of Canaan. And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.

3. And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,

4. I am a stranger and a visitor with you. Give me a possession of a burying place with you, so that I may bury my dead out of my sight.

5. And the sons of Heth answered Abraham saying to him,

6. Hear us, my lord. You [are] a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choice of our burying places. None of us shall withhold from you his burying-place from burying your dead.

7. And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, the sons of Heth.

8. And he spoke with them, saying, If it is your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and ask for me of Ephron the son of Zohar,

9. that he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he has, which [is] in the end of his field. For as much silver as it is worth he shall give it to me for a possession of a burying-place among you.

10. And Ephron lived among the sons of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the ears of the sons of Heth, of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,

11. No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field, and the cave that [is] in it I give to you. In the presence of the sons of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.

12. And Abraham bowed before the people of the land.

13. And he spoke to Ephron in the ears of the people of the land, saying, Only if you would hear me. I will give you silver for the field. Take [it] from me, and I will bury my dead there.

14. And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,

15. My lord, listen to me. The land [is worth] four hundred shekels of silver; what is that between me and you? And bury your dead.

16. And Abraham listened to Ephron. And Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, which passes with the merchant.

17. And the field of Ephron was certified, which was Machpelah, which [was] before Mamre; the field and the cave which [was] in it, and all the trees in the field, in all the borders round about,

18. to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.

19. And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave at the field of Machpelah before Mamre, which [is] Hebron, in the land of Canaan.

20. And the field, and the cave that [is] in it, were certified to Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the sons of Heth.

## Genesis 24

1. And Abraham was old, going on in age. And the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.

2. And Abraham said to the oldest servant of his house, who ruled over all that he had, I pray you, put your hand under my thigh.

3. And I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of Heaven and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.

4. But you shall go to my country and to my kindred, and take a wife to my son Isaac.

5. And the servant said to him, Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I necessarily bring your son again to the land from which you came?

6. And Abraham said to him, Take care that you do not bring my son there again.

7. The LORD, the God of Heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, To your seed I will give this land: He shall send His Angel before you. And you shall take a wife to my son from there.

8. And if the woman will not be willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this oath of mine. Only do not bring my son there again.

9. And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning the matter.

10. And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed. For all the goods of his master were in his hand. And he arose, and went to Mesopotamia to the city of Nahor.

11. And he made his camels kneel down outside the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, the time that women go out to draw.

12. And he said, O LORD, God of my master Abraham, I pray You, send me good speed this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.

13. Behold, I stand by the well of water. And the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water.

14. And let it be that the young woman to whom I shall say, Let down your pitcher, please, so that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give your camels drink also. [Let] her [be] the one that You have appointed for Your servant Isaac. And by it I shall know that You have shown kindness to my master.

15. And before he had finished speaking, it happened, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, [with] her pitcher upon her shoulder.

16. And the young woman [was] very beautiful to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her. And she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.

17. And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Please let me drink a little water of your pitcher.

18. And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hurried and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave [a] drink to him.

19. And when she had finished giving him drink, she said, I will draw [water] for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.

20. And she hurried, and emptied her pitcher in the trough, and ran again to the well to draw [water]. And she drew for all his camels.

21. And the man was watching her, keeping silent, in order to know whether the LORD had prospered his journey or not.

22. And it happened, when the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hand, weighing ten shekels of gold.

23. And he said, Whose daughter [are] you? Please tell me. Is there room in your father's house for us to stay?

24. And she said to him, I [am] the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.

25. And she said to him, We have both straw and fodder enough, and room to lodge in.

26. And the man bowed down [his head], and worshiped the Lord.

27. And he said, Blessed [be] the LORD, God of my master Abraham, who has not left my master destitute of His mercy and His truth. The LORD led me, I [being] in the way to the house of my master's brothers.

28. And the young woman ran and told her mother's house these things.

29. And Rebekah [had] a brother, and his name [was] Laban. And Laban ran out to the man, to the well.

30. And it happened when he saw the earrings and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, So spoke the man to me, he came to the man. And behold, he stood by the camels at the well.

31. And he said, Come in, blessed of the LORD. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.

32. And the man came into the house. And he unloaded his camels, and gave straw and fodder to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men that were with him.

33. And [food] was set before him to eat. But he said, I will not eat until I have told my errand. And he said, Speak on.

34. And he said, I [am] Abraham's servant.

35. And the LORD has blessed my master greatly, and he has become great. And He has given him flocks and herds and silver and gold, and male slaves and slave women, and camels and asses.

36. And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master when she was old. And he has given to him all that he has.

37. And my master made me swear, saying, You shall not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live.

38. But you shall go to my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife to my son.

39. And I said to my master, Perhaps the woman will not follow me.

40. And he said to me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his Angel with you, and prosper your way. And you shall take a wife for my son from my kindred, and from my father's house.

41. Then shall you be clear from my oath when you come to my kindred, and if they do not give you [one], you shall be clear from my oath.

42. And I came this day to the well, and said, O LORD, God of my master Abraham, if now You prosper my way in which I go,

43. behold, I stand by the well of water. And it shall be when the virgin comes forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, please, a little water from your pitcher to drink,

44. and she says to me, Both you drink, and I will also draw for your camels, may she be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master's son.

45. And before I finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. And she went down to the well and drew water. And I said to her, Please let me drink.

46. And she hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give drink to your camels also. So I drank, and she made the camels drink also.

47. And I asked her and said, Whose daughter [are] you? And she said, The [daughter] of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him. And I put the earring upon her nose and the bracelets upon her hands.

48. And I bowed my head and worshiped the LORD, and blessed the LORD, God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter to his son.

49. And now if you will deal kindly and truthfully with my master, tell me. And if not, tell me so that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.

50. And Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing has come forth from the LORD. We cannot speak to you bad or good.

51. Behold! Rebekah is before you; take [her] and go. And let her be the wife of your master's son, even as the LORD has spoken.

52. And it happened, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the earth to the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.

53. And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing, and gave [them] to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother.

54. And they ate and drank, he and the men with him, and stayed all night. And they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master.

55. And her brother and her mother said, Let the young woman stay with us perhaps ten days. After that she shall go.

56. And he said to them, Do not hinder me, since the LORD has prospered my way. Send me away, that I may go away to my master.

57. And they said, We will call the young woman and inquire at her mouth.

58. And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Will you go with this man? And she said, I will go.

59. And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.

60. And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, Our sister, be the mother of thousands of millions, and let your seed possess the gate of those who hate them.

61. And Rebekah rose up, and her young women, and they rode upon the camels and followed the man. And the servant took Rebekah and went his way.

62. And Isaac came from the way of the well, The Well of the Living One, my Beholder. For he lived in the south country.

63. And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the beginning of the evening. And he lifted up his eyes, and looked. And behold, camels coming!

64. And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and she saw Isaac. And she dismounted from the camel.

65. For she said to the servant, What man [is] this that walks in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master. Therefore she took a veil and covered herself.

66. And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.

67. And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. And he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.

## Genesis 25

1. Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.

2. And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.

3. And Jokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim and Letushim and Leummim.

4. And the sons of Midian: Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abida and Eldaah. All these [were] the sons of Keturah.

5. And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.

6. But to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts. And he sent them away from Isaac his son while he still lived, eastward to the east country.

7. And these [are] the days of the years of Abraham's life, which he lived: a hundred seventy-five years.

8. And Abraham expired and died in a good old age, old and satisfied. And he was gathered to his people.

9. And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which [is] before Mamre,

10. the field which Abraham bought from the sons of Heth. Abraham and Sarah his wife were buried there.

11. And after the death of Abraham, it happened that God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac lived by The Well of the Living One, My Beholder.

12. And these [are] the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham.

13. And these [are] the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations. The first-born of Ishmael was Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,

14. and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,

15. Hadad, and Tema and Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.

16. These [were] the sons of Ishmael, and these [were] their names, by their towns and by their settlements; [twelve] chiefs according to their nations.

17. And these [were] the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred thirty-seven years. And he expired and died, and was gathered to his people.

18. And they lived from Havilah to Shur, which [is] before Egypt, [as] you go toward Assyria. And he died in the presence of all his brothers.

19. And these [were] the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham fathered Isaac.

20. And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian.

21. And Isaac prayed to the LORD for his wife, because she [was] barren. And the LORD heard him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.

22. And the sons struggled together within her. And she said, If [it is] so, why [am] I this way? And she went to inquire of the LORD.

23. And the LORD said to her, Two nations [are] in your womb, and two kinds of people shall be separated from your bowels. And the one people shall be stronger than the other people, the older shall serve the younger.

24. And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, twins [were] in her womb!

25. And the first came out red, all over like a hairy garment. And they called his name Esau.

26. And after that his brother came out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel. And his name was called Jacob. And Isaac [was] sixty years old when she bore them.

27. And the boys grew. And Esau was a man knowing hunting, and Jacob was a simple man, living in tents.

28. And Isaac loved Esau, for game was in [his] mouth. But Rebekah loved Jacob.

29. And Jacob boiled soup. And Esau came from the field, and he was faint.

30. And Esau said to Jacob, I beg you, Let me eat of the red, this red [soup], for I am faint. Therefore his name was called Edom.

31. And Jacob said, Sell me your birthright today.

32. And Esau said, Behold, I [am] at the point of dying, and what [profit shall] this birthright be to me?

33. And Jacob said, Swear to me this day. And he swore to him, and he sold his birthright to Jacob.

34. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and soup of lentils. And he ate and drank, and rose up and went his way. And Esau despised [his] birthright.

## Genesis 26

1. And there was a famine in the land, besides the famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar.

2. And the LORD appeared to him and said, Do not go down into Egypt. Live in the land which I shall tell you of.

3. Stay in this land, and I will be with you and bless you. For to you and to your seed I will give all these lands; and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.

4. And I will make your seed to multiply as the stars of the heavens, and will give to your seed all these lands. And in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,

5. because Abraham obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.

6. And Isaac lived in Gerar.

7. And the men of the place asked about his wife. And he said, She is my sister. For he feared to say, My wife; lest the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah, because she was beautiful of form.

8. And when he had been there a long time, it happened that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out through the window, and saw; and behold! Isaac [was] caressing Rebekah his wife.

9. And Abimelech called Isaac and said, Behold! She surely [is] your wife. And why did you say, She [is] my sister? And Isaac said to him, Because I said, Lest I die on account of her.

10. And Abimelech said, What [is] this you have done to us? One of the people might have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.

11. And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.

12. Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundredfold. And the LORD blessed him.

13. And the man became great. And he went forward and grew until he grew very great.

14. And he had possession of flocks and possession of herds, and many servants. And the Philistines envied him.

15. For all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them and filled them with earth.

16. And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go away from us, for you are mightier than we are.

17. And Isaac departed from there, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and lived there.

18. And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. And he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.

19. And Isaac's servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of flowing water.

20. And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is ours. And he called the name of the well Contention, because they strove with him.

21. And they dug another well, and [they] strove for that also. And he called the name of it Opposition.

22. And he moved from there, and dug another well, and they did not strive for that. And he called the name of it Broad Places. And he said, For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.

23. And he went from there to Beer-sheba.

24. And the LORD appeared to him the same night, and said, I [am] the God of Abraham your father. Do not fear, for I [am] with you, and will bless you and multiply your seed for My servant Abraham's sake.

25. And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there. And Isaac's servants dug a well there.

26. Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath, one of his friends, and Phicol the commander of his army.

27. And Isaac said to them, Why do you come to me, since you hate me and have sent me away from you?

28. And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with you. And we said, Let there be now an oath between us, between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you;

29. that you will do us no harm since we have not touched you, and since we have done nothing but good to you, and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the LORD.

30. And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.

31. And they rose up early in the morning, and swore to one another. And Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.

32. And the same day it happened, Isaac's servants came and told him about the well which they had dug. And they said to him, We have found water.

33. And he called it Shebah. Therefore the name of the city [is] The Well of Sheba to this day.

34. And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite;

35. who were a grief of spirit to Isaac and to Rebekah.

## Genesis 27

1. And it happened when Isaac [was] old and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called his oldest son Esau and said to him, My son. And he said to him, Behold, I [am] here.

2. And he said to him, Behold, here am I. And he said, Behold now, I am old, I do not know the day of my death.

3. And now please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me.

4. And make tasty meat for me, such as I love, and bring to me so that I may eat, that my soul may bless you before I die.

5. And Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt game in order to bring [it].

6. And Rebekah spoke to her son Jacob, saying, Behold, I heard your father speak to your brother Esau, saying,

7. Bring me game, and make me delicious things so that I may eat and bless you before the LORD before my death.

8. And now, my son, obey my voice according to what I command you.

9. Go now to the flock, and bring me from there two good kids of the goats. And I will make them delicious things for your father, such as he loves.

10. And you shall bring it to your father so that he may eat, and that he may bless you before his death.

11. And Jacob said to his mother Rebekah, Behold, Esau my brother [is] a hairy man, and I [am] a smooth man.

12. My father will perhaps feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver. And I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.

13. And his mother said to him, Your curse [be] upon me, my son, only obey my voice and go bring them to me.

14. And he went. And he took them and brought to his mother. And his mother made delicious things such as his father loved.

15. And Rebekah took the clothes of her older son Esau, the costly ones which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son.

16. And she put the skins from the kids of the goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck.

17. And she gave the delicious things and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son Jacob.

18. And he came to his father and said, My father! And he said, Here I [am]; who are you, my son?

19. And Jacob said to his father, I [am] Esau your first-born. I have done as you asked me. Arise, I pray you, sit and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.

20. And Isaac said to his son, How [is it] that you have found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD your God brought [it] to me.

21. And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray you, so that I may feel you, my son, whether you are truly my son Esau or not.

22. And Jacob went near to Isaac his father. And he felt him and said, The voice [is] Jacob's voice, but the hands the hands of Esau.

23. And he did not know him because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands. And he blessed him.

24. And he said, [Are] you truly my son Esau? And he said, I [am].

25. And he said, Bring [it] to me, and I will eat of my son's game, so that my soul may bless you. And he brought [it] near to him, and he ate. And he brought him wine, and he drank.

26. And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now and kiss me, my son.

27. And he came near and kissed him. And he smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son [is] as the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed.

28. And may God give you of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and wine.

29. Let people serve you, and let nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and let your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed [be] everyone that curses you, and blessed [be] he that blesses you.

30. And it happened, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was scarcely gone from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.

31. And he also had made tasty meat and brought to his father. And he said to his father, Let my father arise and eat of his son's game so that your soul may bless me.

32. And his father Isaac said to him, Who [are] you? And he said, I [am] your son, your first-born, Esau.

33. And Isaac trembled with a great trembling, and said, Who then [was] the one who has hunted deer and brought to me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? Yea, he shall be blessed!

34. And when Esau heard the voice of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me, me also, O my father!

35. And he said, Your brother came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing.

36. And he said, [It is] because his name [is] called Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have you not reserved a blessing for me?

37. And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold! I have made him your lord, and all his brothers I have given him for servants. And with grain and wine I have supported him. And what shall I do now to you, my son?

38. And Esau said to his father, Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, me also, my father. And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.

39. And Isaac his father answered and said to him, Behold! Your dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heaven from above.

40. And by your sword you shall live, and shall serve your brother. And it shall be when you shall have the dominion, you shall break his yoke from off your neck.

41. And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him. And Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning [for] my father are at hand. Then I will kill my brother Jacob.

42. And these words of her older son Esau were told to Rebekah. And she sent and called her younger son Jacob, and said to him, Behold, your brother Esau is going to ease himself on you, to kill you.

43. And now, my son, obey my voice and arise. Flee for yourself to my brother Laban, to Haran,

44. and stay with him a few days until your brother's fury turns away,

45. until your brother's anger turns away from you and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I also be bereaved of both of you [in] one day?

46. And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, like these of the daughters of the land, what good is [my] life to me?

## Genesis 28

1. And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and commanded him. And he said to him, You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.

2. Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father. And take a wife from there of the daughters of Laban your mother's brother.

3. And may God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, so that you may be a multitude of peoples.

4. And may He give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your seed with you, so that you may inherit the land in which you are a stranger, which God gave to Abraham.

5. And Isaac sent Jacob away. And he went to Padan-aram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.

6. And Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him away to Padan-aram in order to take a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a command, saying, You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;

7. and Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and had gone to Padan-aram;

8. and when Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan did not please Isaac his father;

9. then Esau went to Ishmael, and took Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to the wives [which] he [had] for his wife.

10. And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.

11. And he came on a certain place, and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. And he took of the stones of that place, and placed [them] at his head. And he lay down in that place to sleep.

12. And he dreamed. And behold! A ladder was set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to Heaven! And behold! The angels of God [were] ascending and descending on it!

13. And behold! The LORD stood above it, and said, I [am] Jehovah, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac! The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your seed.

14. And your seed shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And in you and in your Seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.

15. And, behold, I [am] with you, and will keep you in every [place] where you go, and will bring you again into this land. For I will not leave you until I have done that which I have spoken of to you.

16. And Jacob awakened from his sleep. And he said, Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know.

17. And he was afraid, and said, How fearful [is] this place! This [is] nothing but the house of God, and this [is] the gate of Heaven!

18. And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone which he had put at his head, and set it [as] a memorial pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.

19. And he called the name of that place The House of God. But the name of that city [was] Luz at first.

20. And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to put on,

21. and I come again to my father's house in peace, then shall Jehovah be my God.

22. And this stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God's house. And of all that You shall give me, I will surely give the tenth to You.

## Genesis 29

1. And Jacob lifted his feet and went to the land of the sons of the east.

2. And he looked, and behold, a well [was] in the field! And, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it, for they watered the flocks out of that well. And a great stone [was] upon the well's mouth.

3. And all the flocks were gathered there. And they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in its place.

4. And Jacob said to them, My brothers, where [are] you from? And they said, We [are] from Haran.

5. And he said to them, Do you know Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know [him].

6. And he said to them, [Is] he well? And they said, He [is] well. And, behold, his daughter Rachel comes with the sheep.

7. And he said, Lo, the day [is] yet high. [It is] not yet time for gathering the cattle together. Water the sheep, and go feed [them].

8. And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks have been gathered together. And they roll the stone from the well's mouth, then we water the sheep.

9. While he still spoke with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she kept them.

10. And it happened when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, then Jacob went near and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flocks of Laban his mother's brother.

11. And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept.

12. And Jacob told Rachel that he [was] her father's brother, and that he [was] Rebekah's son. And she ran and told her father.

13. And it happened when Laban heard the news of Jacob his sister's son, he ran to meet him and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.

14. And Laban said to him, Surely you [are] my bone and my flesh. And he stayed with him for a month.

15. And Laban said to Jacob, Because you [are] my brother, should you then serve me for nothing? Tell me, what [shall be] your wages?

16. And Laban had two daughters. The name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.

17. And Leah was weak of eyes, but Rachel was beautiful and well-favored.

18. And Jacob loved Rachel, and said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.

19. And Laban said, [It is] better that I give her to you than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.

20. And Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him a few days, for the love he had for her.

21. And Jacob said to Laban, Give [me] my wife, for my days are fulfilled, so that I may go in to her.

22. And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.

23. And it happened in the evening, he took his daughter Leah and brought her to him. And he went in to her.

24. And Laban gave Zilpah his slave woman to his daughter Leah for a handmaid.

25. And it happened in the morning, behold, it [was] Leah! And he said to Laban, What [is] this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you tricked me?

26. And Laban said, It must not be done so in our country, to give the younger before the first-born.

27. Fulfill her week, and we will give you this one also for the service which you shall serve with me still another seven years.

28. And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. And he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.

29. And Laban gave Bilhah his slave woman to his daughter Rachel, to be her handmaid.

30. And he also went in to Rachel. He also loved Rachel more than Leah, and served with him still seven more years.

31. And when the LORD saw that Leah [was] hated, even He opened her womb. But Rachel [was] barren.

32. And Leah conceived and bore a son. And she called his name Reuben, for she said, Surely the LORD has looked upon my afflictions. Now therefore my husband will love me.

33. And she conceived again, and bore a son, and said, Because the LORD has heard that I was hated, He has therefore given me this [son] also. And she called his name Simeon.

34. And she conceived again, and bore a son, and said, Now this time my husband will return to me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore his name was called Levi.

35. And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she said, This time I will praise the LORD. Therefore she called his name Judah, and quit bearing.

## Genesis 30

1. And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister. And she said to Jacob, Give me sons, or else I will die.

2. And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel. And he said, Am I in God's stead, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?

3. And she said, Behold my slave woman Bilhah; go in to her, and she shall bear upon my knees, and yea, let me be built up from her, me also.

4. And she gave him her slave woman Bilhah to wife. And Jacob went in to her.

5. And Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son.

6. And Rachel said, God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son. Therefore she called his name Dan.

7. And Rachel's slave woman Bilhah conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.

8. And Rachel said, With the wrestlings of God I have wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed. And she called his name Naphtali.

9. When Leah saw that she had quit bearing, she took her slave woman Zilpah and gave her to Jacob to wife.

10. And Leah's slave woman Zilpah bore Jacob a son.

11. And Leah said, With fortune. And she called his name Gad.

12. And Leah's slave woman Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.

13. And Leah said, I am happy, for the daughters will call me blessed. And she called his name Asher.

14. And Reuben went out in the days of the wheat harvest, and found love-apples in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. And Rachel said to Leah, please give me some of your son's love-apples.

15. And she said to her, [Is it] a small matter that you have taken my husband? And would you also take my son's love-apples? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with you tonight for your son's love-apples.

16. And Jacob came out of the field in the evening. And Leah went out to meet him, and said, You must come in to me, for I have surely hired you with my son's love-apples. And he lay with her that night.

17. And God listened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob the fifth son.

18. And Leah said, God has given me my hire, because I gave my slave to my husband. And she called his name Issachar.

19. And Leah conceived again, and bore Jacob the sixth son.

20. And Leah said, God has given me a good present. Now my husband will live with me, because I have borne him six sons. And she called his name Zebulun.

21. And afterward she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah.

22. And God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her and opened her womb.

23. And she conceived and bore a son, and she said, God has taken away my reproach.

24. And she called his name Joseph. And she said, May the LORD add another son to me.

25. And when Rachel had borne Joseph, it happened that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away so that I may go into my own place and to my country.

26. Give me my wives and my children, [for] whom I have served you, and let me go. For you know my service which I have done you.

27. And Laban said to him, I pray you, if I have found favor in your eyes, stay. For I have seen omens, that the LORD has blessed me for your sake.

28. And he said, Appoint your wages and I will give.

29. He said to him, You know how I have served you, and what your cattle has become with me.

30. For you had little before I [came], and it has now increased to a multitude. And the LORD has blessed you since my coming. And now when shall I provide for my own house also?

31. And he said, What shall I give you? And Jacob said, You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep your flock.

32. I will pass through all the flocks today, taking out all the speckled and spotted sheep, and all of the black sheep among the lambs, and the spotted and the speckled among the goats. And these shall be my hire.

33. And shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, and it shall come for my hire before your face. Every one that [is] not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, shall be counted stolen with me.

34. And Laban said, Yes, truly let it be according to your word.

35. And that day he took out the he-goats that were striped and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black from among the lambs, and gave [them] into the hand of his sons.

36. And he set three days' journey between himself and Jacob. And Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.

37. And Jacob took rods of green poplar, and of a fresh tree, and the almond and plane tree. And he peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.

38. And he set the rods which he had peeled by the troughs, by the water troughs, where the flocks came to drink, across from the flocks, and the flocks were in heat when they came to drink.

39. And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth striped cattle, speckled, and spotted.

40. And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped, and all the black in the flock of Laban. And he put his own flocks by themselves, and did not put them with the flock of Laban.

41. And it happened when the stronger flocks conceived, Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flocks in the troughs, so that they might conceive among the rods.

42. But when the flocks were feeble, he did not put [them] in. And usually it came to be, the weak ones were Laban's and the stronger ones Jacob's.

43. And the man increased exceedingly, and [had] many flocks, and maidservants, and male servants, and camels, and asses.

## Genesis 31

1. And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob has taken away all that [was] our father's, and he has gotten all this glory from that which was our father's.

2. And Jacob saw the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.

3. And the LORD said to Jacob, Return to the land of your fathers, and to your kindred, and I will be with you.

4. And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flocks.

5. And he said to them, I see your father's face, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.

6. And you know that with all my power I have served your father,

7. and your father has deceived me and changed my wages ten times. But God did not allow him to hurt me.

8. If he said this, The speckled shall be your wages, then all the flocks bore speckled. And if he said this, The striped shall be your hire, then all the flocks bore striped.

9. And God has taken away the flocks of your father, and has given them to me.

10. And at the time the cattle conceived, I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were striped, speckled, and mottled.

11. And the Angel of God spoke to me in a dream, saying, Jacob! And I said, Here I [am].

12. And He said, Lift up your eyes and see all the rams which leap upon the cattle, that they [are] striped, speckled, and mottled. For I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.

13. I [am] the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar, where you vowed a vow to Me. Now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your kindred.

14. And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, [Is there] yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?

15. Are we not counted strangers by him? For he has sold us, and has also entirely devoured our silver.

16. For all the riches which God has taken from our father, that [is] for us and for our sons. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.

17. Then Jacob rose up and set his sons and wives upon camels.

18. And he drove away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his property, which he had gotten in Padan-aram, in order to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.

19. And Laban went to shear his sheep. And Rachel had stolen the images which were her father's.

20. And Jacob deceived the heart of Laban the Syrian, in that he did not tell him that he fled.

21. And he fled with all that was his. And he rose up and passed over the river, and set his face toward Mount Gilead.

22. It was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled.

23. And he took his brothers with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey. And they overtook him in Mount Gilead.

24. And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said to him, Take heed that you do not speak either good or bad to Jacob.

25. Then Laban overtook Jacob. And Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount. And Laban with his brothers pitched in Mount Gilead.

26. And Laban said to Jacob, What have you done, that you have deceived my heart and carried away my daughters as captives [taken] with the sword?

27. Why did you flee away secretly, and steal away from me, and did not tell me so that I might have sent you away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret and with harp?

28. And why have you not allowed me to kiss my sons and my daughters? You have done foolishly in so doing.

29. It is in the power of my hand to do you harm. But the God of your fathers spoke to me last night, saying, Take heed that you do not speak either good or bad to Jacob.

30. And now you have gone because you longed after your father's house. Why have you stolen my gods?

31. And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I [was] afraid, for I said, Perhaps you would take your daughters away from me by force.

32. With whomever you find your gods, let him not live. Before our brothers, choose what [is] yours with me, and take [it] to you. For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.

33. And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tents of the two slave women, and he did not find. And he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.

34. And Rachel had taken the images and put them into the camel's saddle, and sat on them. And Laban searched all the tent, but did not find them.

35. But she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before you. For the custom of women [is] upon me. And he searched, but did not find the images.

36. And Jacob was angry, and rebuked Laban. And Jacob answered and said to Laban, What [is] my trespass? What [is] my sin, that you have so hotly pursued after me?

37. For you have searched all my stuff; what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my brothers and your brothers, that they may judge between us both.

38. I [was] with you these twenty years. Your ewes and she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of your flock I have not eaten.

39. That which was mangled I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it. You required it at my hand, [whether] stolen by day, or stolen by night.

40. I was there; in the day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night. And my sleep departed from my eyes.

41. And I have been twenty years in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six for your flocks. And you have changed my wages ten times.

42. Unless the God of my fathers, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac had been with me, surely you would have sent me away now empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked [you last] night.

43. And Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters [are] my daughters, and the sons my sons, and the flocks my flocks. All that you see [is] mine. And what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their sons which they have borne?

44. And come now, let us make a covenant, you and I. And let it be for a witness between you and me.

45. And Jacob took a stone and set it up as a memorial pillar.

46. And Jacob said to his brothers, Gather stones. And they took stones and made a heap. And they ate there upon the heap.

47. And Laban called it in [Syrian], Heap of the Testimony, and Jacob called it in Hebrew, Heap of Testimony.

48. And Laban said, This heap [is] a witness between you and me this day. Therefore the name of it was called Heap of Testimony,

49. and Watchtower, for he said, The LORD watch between you and me when we are absent from one another.

50. If you shall not] afflict my daughters, or if you shall take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us. See! God is witness between you and me.

51. And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar which I have set up between you and me.

52. This heap [is] a witness, and the pillar [is] a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you shall not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.

53. The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.

54. And Jacob offered sacrifice on the mountain, and called his brothers to eat bread. And they ate bread and stayed all night in the mountain.

55. And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. And Laban departed and returned to his place.

## Genesis 32

1. And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

2. And when Jacob saw them he said, This [is] God's camp. And he called the name of that place Refuge.

3. And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, to the land of Seir, the country of Edom.

4. And he commanded them, saying, So shall you speak to my lord Esau: Your servant Jacob says thus, I have lived with Laban and stayed until now.

5. And I [have] oxen and asses, flocks, and menservants, and slave women. And I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in your sight.

6. And the messengers returned to Jacob saying, We came to your brother Esau, and also he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him.

7. Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed, and he divided the people with him, and the flocks and herds, and the camels, into two bands.

8. And he said, If Esau comes to the one company and strikes it, then the other company which is left shall escape.

9. And Jacob said, Oh God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Jehovah, who said to me, Return to your country and to your kindred, and I will deal well with you:

10. I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which You have done to Your servant. For with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I have become two bands.

11. Deliver me, I pray You, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau. For I fear him, lest he come and strike me, from mother to sons.

12. And You said, I will surely do you good, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.

13. And he lodged there that night. And he took of that which came to his hand, a present for Esau his brother

14. two hundred she-goats, twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,

15. thirty milk camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.

16. And he delivered into the hands of his servants, every drove by themselves. And he said to his servants, Pass over in front of me and put a space between drove and drove.

17. And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets you, and asks you saying, To whom do you belong? and, Where do you go? And whose are] these before you?

18. Then you shall say, Your servant Jacob's. It [is] a present sent to my lord Esau. And, behold, he also [is] behind us.

19. And so he commanded the second and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, In this way you shall speak to Esau when you find him.

20. And also you shall say, Behold, your servant Jacob [is] behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.

21. And the present went over before him. And he himself lodged that night in the camp.

22. And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two slave women, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.

23. And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over what he had.

24. And Jacob was left alone. And a Man wrestled there with him until the breaking of the day.

25. And when He saw that He did not prevail against him, He touched the hollow of his thigh. And the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with Him.

26. And He said, Let Me go, for the day breaks. And he said, I will not let You go except You bless me.

27. And He said to him, What [is] your name? And he said, Jacob.

28. And He said, Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for like a prince you have power with God and with men, and have prevailed.

29. And Jacob asked and said, I pray You, reveal Your name. And He said, Why do you ask after My name? And He blessed him there.

30. And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel; for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.

31. And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he limped upon his thigh.

32. Therefore the sons of Israel do not eat of the sinew of the thigh, which is on the hip-socket, until this day, because He touched Jacob's hip-socket, the sinew of the thigh.

## Genesis 33

1. And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked. And behold, Esau came, and four hundred men with him. And he divided the children to Leah, and to Rachel, and to the two handmaids.

2. And he put the slave women and their children first, and Leah and her children afterward, and Rachel and Joseph last.

3. And he passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.

4. And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell upon his neck and kissed him. And they wept.

5. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the boys, and said, Who [are] these [with] you? And he said, The boys with] whom God has favored your servant.

6. Then the slave women came near, they and their boys, and they bowed themselves.

7. And Leah also, and her children, came near and bowed themselves. And afterward Joseph and Rachel came near and bowed.

8. He asked, Whose [is] all this camp which I met? And he said, To find grace in the sight of my lord.

9. And Esau said, I have enough, my brother. Keep what you have yourself.

10. And Jacob said, No, please, if now I have found grace in your sight, then receive my present at my hand. For therefore have I seen your face, as though I had seen the face of God, and you were pleased with me.

11. Please take my blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he accepted.

12. And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you.

13. And he said to him, My lord knows that the boys are tender, and the flocks and herds with me [are] suckling. And if the men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.

14. Please let my lord pass over before his servant, and I will lead on softly, according as the flocks that go before me, and the boys, are able to endure, until I come to my lord to Seir.

15. And Esau said, Let me now leave with you [some] of the people with me. And he said, Why this? Let me find grace in the sight of my lord.

16. And Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.

17. And Jacob journeyed to Succoth and built himself a house, and made booths for his cattle. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.

18. And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which [is] in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram. And he pitched his tent in front of the city.

19. And he bought a piece of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of silver.

20. And he erected there an altar, and called it El, the God of Israel.

## Genesis 34

1. And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.

2. And when Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her and lay with her, and defiled her.

3. And his soul clung to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke to the heart of the girl.

4. And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Get me this girl for a wife.

5. And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter. And his sons were with his cattle in the field. And Jacob kept silent until they had come.

6. And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him.

7. And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard. And the men were furious, and they were very angry, because he had done folly in Israel, in lying with the daughter of Jacob. And it ought not to be done so.

8. And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him for a wife.

9. And you make marriages with us, giving your daughters to us, and taking our daughters to you.

10. And you shall live with us. And the land shall be before you. Live and trade in it, and get possessions in it.

11. And Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, Let me find grace in your eyes, and whatever you shall say to me I will give.

12. Heap upon me ever so much price and dowry, and I will give according as you shall say to me. But give me the girl for a wife.

13. And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father, speaking with deceit because he had defiled Dinah their sister.

14. And they said to them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised. For it [is] a reproach to us.

15. But in this we will agree with you, if you will be as we [are], that every male of you be circumcised,

16. then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will live with you, and we will become one people.

17. But if you will not listen to us, to be circumcised, then we will take our daughter, and we will go.

18. And their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor's son.

19. And the young man did not hesitate to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter. And he [was] more honorable than all the house of his father.

20. And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and talked with the men of their city, saying,

21. These men [are] at peace with us. Therefore let them live in the land, and trade in it. For behold, the land [is] large enough for them. Let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.

22. Only on this [condition] will the men agree to us, to live with us, to be one people, if every male among us is circumcised as they [are] circumcised.

23. [Shall] not their cattle and their substance and every animal of theirs be ours? Only let us agree with them, and they will live with us.

24. And all that went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and to Shechem his son. And every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.

25. And it happened on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took each his sword and came upon the city boldly, and killed all the males.

26. And they killed Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.

27. The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.

28. They took their sheep and their oxen, and their asses, and that which [was] in the city and that which [was] in the field.

29. And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives, they took captive, and plundered even all that [was] in the house.

30. And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have troubled me, to make me stink among those who live in the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. And I, [being] few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and kill me. And I shall be destroyed, my house and I.

31. And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?

## Genesis 35

1. And God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and live there. And make an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother.

2. Then Jacob said to his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods among you, and be clean, and change your garments.

3. And let us arise and go up to Bethel, and I will make an altar there to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.

4. And they gave all the strange gods which [were] in their hands to Jacob, and the earrings in their ears. And Jacob hid them under the oak which [was] by Shechem.

5. And they moved. And the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.

6. And Jacob came to Luz in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people with him.

7. And he built an altar there and called the place El-bethel, because God appeared to him there when he fled from the face of his brother.

8. But Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried beneath Bethel, under an oak. And the name of it was called Oak of Weeping.

9. And God appeared to Jacob again when he came out of Padan-aram and blessed him.

10. And God said to him, Your name [is] Jacob. Your name shall not be called Jacob any more, but Israel shall be your name. And He called his name Israel.

11. And God said to him, I [am] God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall be from you, and kings shall come out of your loins.

12. And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to you, and to your seed after you I will give the land.

13. And God went up from him in the place where He talked with him.

14. And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He talked with him, a pillar of stone. And he poured a drink offering on it, and he poured oil on it.

15. And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Bethel.

16. And they moved from Bethel. And there was only a length of land to come to Ephrath. And Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor in her bearing.

17. And it happened when she was in hard labor in her bearing, the midwife said to her, Do not fear, you shall have this son also.

18. And it happened as her soul was departing (for she died) that she called his name Benoni. But his father called him Benjamin.

19. And Rachel died and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.

20. And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave. That is the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.

21. And Israel moved, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.

22. And it happened when Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine. And Israel heard it. And the sons of Jacob were twelve:

23. The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun.

24. The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.

25. And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's slave woman: Dan and Naphtali.

26. And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's slave woman: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob born to him in Padan-aram.

27. And Jacob came to his father Isaac, to Mamre, to the city of Arba, which [is] Hebron, where Abraham had lived, and Isaac.

28. And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years.

29. And Isaac expired and died, and was gathered to his people, old and satisfied of days. And his sons, Esau and Jacob, buried him.

## Genesis 36

1. And these are the generations of Esau, that is Edom.

2. Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan, Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,

3. And Basemath the daughter of Ishmael, sister of Nebajoth.

4. And Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau. And Basemath bore Reuel.

6. And Esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance which he had gotten in the land of Canaan, and went into the country away from the face of his brother Jacob.

7. For their riches were more than [that] they might dwell together. And the land of their travels could not bear them because of their cattle.

8. And Esau lived in Mount Seir. Esau [is] Edom.

9. And these are the generations of Esau, the father of the Edomites, in Mount Seir.

10. These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau; Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau.

31. And these [were] the kings that reigned in the land of Edom before the reigning of a king over the sons of Israel.

32. And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom. And the name of his city [was] Dinhabah.

## Genesis 37

1. And Jacob lived in the land of the travels of his father, in the land of Canaan.

2. These [are] the generations of Jacob: Joseph, a son of seventeen years, came tending the flock with his brothers. And he was a youth with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives. And Joseph brought to his father an evil report of them.

3. And Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a tunic [reaching to] the soles [of his] feet.

4. And when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.

5. And Joseph dreamed a dream and told [it] to his brothers. And they hated him still more.

6. And he said to them, I pray you, Hear this dream which I have dreamed.

7. For behold! We [were] binding sheaves in the middle of the field, and lo, my sheaf arose and also stood upright. And behold, your sheaves stood around and bowed down to my sheaf.

8. And his brothers said to him, Shall you indeed reign over us? Or shall you indeed have the rule over us? And they hated him still more for his dreams and for his words.

9. And he dreamed still another dream, and told it to his brothers. And he said, Behold, I have dreamed another dream. And behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars bowed down to me.

10. And he told [it] to his father and to his brothers. And his father rebuked him and said to him, What [is] this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I, and your mother, and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the earth before you?

11. And his brothers were jealous of him. But his father observed the saying.

12. And his brothers went to feed his father's flock in Shechem.

13. And Israel said to Joseph, Do not your brothers feed the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them. And he said to him, Here I [am].

14. And he said to him, please go see whether it is well with your brothers and well with the flocks. And bring me word again. And he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.

15. And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field. And the man asked him, saying, What are you looking for?

16. And he said, I [am] seeking for my brothers. Please tell me where they are feeding.

17. And the man said, They are gone from here, for I heard [them] say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.

18. And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near them, they conspired against him to kill him.

19. And they said to one another, Behold, this dreamer comes.

20. Therefore come now, and let us kill him, and throw him into some pit, and we will say some evil beast has devoured him. And we shall see what will become of his dreams.

21. And Reuben heard, and [he] delivered him out of their hands and said, Let us not kill him.

22. And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him (in order to rescue him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again).

23. And it happened when Joseph had come to his brothers, they stripped Joseph out of his tunic, the tunic reaching to the soles [of his] feet that was on him.

24. And they took him and threw him into a pit. And the pit [was] empty, with no water in it.

25. And they sat down to eat bread. And they lifted up their eyes, and looked. And behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.

26. And Judah said to his brothers, What profit [is it] if we should kill our brother and hide his blood?

27. Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him. For he [is] our brother, and our flesh. And his brothers listened.

28. And men, Midianites traders, came by. And they drew up Joseph and took him out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty [pieces] of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.

29. And Reuben returned to the pit. And behold! Joseph [was] not in the pit! And he tore his clothes.

30. And he returned to his brothers and said, The child, he is not. And I, where shall I go?

31. And they took Joseph's tunic, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the tunic in the blood.

32. And they sent the tunic [reaching to] the soles of the feet, and they brought it to their father. And they said, We have found this. Do you know whether it [is] your son's coat or not?

33. And he knew it, and said, [It is] my son's tunic. An evil beast has eaten him. Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.

34. And Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.

35. And all his sons, and all his daughters, rose up to comfort him. But he refused to be comforted. And he said, For I will go down into the grave to my son mourning. And his father wept for him.

36. And the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, a eunuch of Pharaoh, the chief of the executioners.

## Genesis 38

1. And it happened at that time Judah went down from his brothers and turned in to a certain Adullamite, named Hirah.

2. And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite man named Shuah. And he took her and went in to her.

3. And she conceived and bore a son. And he called his name Er.

4. And she conceived again, and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.

5. And she yet again conceived and bore a son. And she called his name Shelah. And she was at Chezib when she bore him.

6. And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, whose name [was] Tamar.

7. And Er, Judah's first-born, was wicked in the sight of the LORD. And the LORD killed him.

8. And Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brother's wife, and marry [her], and raise up seed to your brother.

9. And Onan knew that the seed would not be his. And it happened when he went in to his brother's wife, that he spilled on the ground, not giving seed to his brother.

10. And what he did was evil in the eyes of the LORD. Therefore He killed him also.

11. Then said Judah to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow at your father's house until Shelah my son is grown. For he said, Lest perhaps he die also, as his brothers [did]. And Tamar went and lived in her father's house.

12. And the days were many, and Judah's wife, the daughter of Shuah, died. And Judah was comforted, and went up to shearers of his sheep, he and his friend Hiram of Adullam, to Timnah.

13. And it was told to Tamar, saying, Behold, your father-in-law goes up to Timnah to shear his sheep.

14. And she put off her widow's clothes, and covered herself with a veil, and wrapped herself. And [she] sat in an open place, which [is] by the way to Timnah. For she saw that Shelah was grown and she was not given to him as wife.

15. When Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot, because she had covered her face.

16. And he turned aside to her by the wayside, and said, Come now, let me come in to you. For he did not know that she [was] his daughter-in-law. And she said, What will you give me, so that you may come in to me?

17. And he said, I will send a kid of the goats from the flock. And she said, Will you give me a pledge until you send [it] ?

18. And he said, What pledge shall I give you? And she said, Your signet, and your bracelet, and your staff that [is] in your hand. And he gave to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.

19. And she arose, and went away, and laid away her veil from her, and put on the clothes of her widowhood.

20. And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive [his] pledge from the woman's hand. But he did not find her.

21. Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where [is] the harlot who was by the wayside? And they said, There [was] no harlot here.

22. And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her. And also the men of the place said, There [was] no harlot here.

23. And Judah said, Let her take [it] to her, lest we be ashamed. Behold, I sent this kid, and you have not found her.

24. And it happened, about three months afterward, that it was told Judah, saying, Your daughter-in-law Tamar has played the harlot, and also, behold, she [is] with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burned.

25. When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, I am with child by the man whose things these [are]. And she said, Please observe. Whose things are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff?

26. And Judah acknowledged [them], and said, She has been more righteous than I have, because I did not give her to my son Shelah. And he never knew her again.

27. And it happened, in the time of her travail, behold, twins [were] in her womb.

28. And when she travailed, it happened that [one] put out a hand. And the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This one came out first.

29. And it happened as he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out. And she said, How have you broken a break for yourself? And his name was called Pharez.

30. And afterwards his brother came out, on whose hand was the scarlet thread. And his name was called Zarah.

## Genesis 39

1. And Joseph was brought down to Egypt. And Potiphar, a eunuch of Pharaoh, the chief of the executioners, an Egyptian man, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there.

2. And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. And he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.

3. And his master saw that the LORD [was] with him, and that the LORD made all he did to prosper in his hand.

4. And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him. And he made him overseer over his house, and he put into his hand all he had.

5. And it happened from the time he had made him overseer in his house, and over all he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake. And the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field.

6. And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand. And he did not know anything that he had, except the bread which he ate. And Joseph was beautiful in form and beautiful in appearance.

7. And after these things it happened that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph. And she said, Lie with me.

8. But he refused and said to his master's wife, Behold, my master does not know what [is] in the house with me, and he has given all that he has into my hand.

9. [There is] none greater in this house than I. Neither has he kept back anything from me except you, because you [are] his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?

10. And it happened as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he did not listen to her to lie with her, [or] to be with her.

11. And it happened about this time that he came into the house to do his work. And none of the men of the house [were] inside.

12. And she caught him by his robe, saying, Lie with me. And he left his robe in her hand and fled, and got out.

13. And it happened when she saw that he had left his robe in her hand, and had fled,

14. she called to the men of her house and spoke to them, saying, See, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us. He came in to me, to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.

15. And it happened when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his robe with me, and fled, and got out.

16. And she laid up his robe beside her until his lord came home.

17. And she spoke to him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant which you have brought to us came in to me to mock me.

18. And it happened as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his robe with me and ran out.

19. And it happened when his master heard the words of his wife which she spoke to him, saying, Your servant did this to me, his wrath was kindled.

20. And Joseph's master took him and put him in the prison, a place where the king's prisoners [were] bound. And he was there in the prison.

21. But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.

22. And the keeper of the prison gave all the prisoners in the prison into Joseph's hand. And whatever they did there, he was the doer of it.

23. The keeper of the prison did not look to anything under his hand, because the LORD was with him; and whatever he did, the LORD made [it] to prosper.

## Genesis 40

1. And after these things it happened that the cupbearer of the king of Egypt, and his baker, had offended their lord the king of Egypt.

2. And Pharaoh was angry against two of his eunuchs, against the chief of the cupbearers and against the chief of the bakers.

3. And he put them under guard in the house of the chief of the executioners, into the prison, the place where Joseph [was] bound.

4. And the chief of the executioners charged Joseph with them, and he served them. And they continued for a time under guard.

5. And they dreamed a dream, both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who [were] bound in the prison.

6. And Joseph came in to them in the morning, and looked upon them, and behold, they [were] sad.

7. And he asked Pharaoh's eunuchs who [were] with him under guard in his lord's house, saying, Why are your faces sad today?

8. And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and [there is] no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations [belong] to God? Now tell it to me.

9. And the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine [was] before me.

10. And in the vine [were] three branches. And it was as if it budded, and its blossom shot up. And the clusters of it brought forth ripe grapes.

11. And Pharaoh's cup [was] in my hand. And I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.

12. And Joseph said to him, This [is] the interpretation of it. The three branches are three days.

13. Yet within three days Pharaoh shall lift up your head and restore you to your place. And you shall deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, just as you did when you were his cupbearer.

14. But remember me when it is well with you, and please show kindness to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.

15. For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.

16. When the chief baker saw the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also [saw] in my dream, and three baskets of white bread [were] on my head.

17. And in the top basket [were] all kinds of baked foods for Pharaoh. And the birds ate them out of the basket upon my head.

18. And Joseph answered and said, This [is] the interpretation of it. The three baskets are three days.

19. Yet within three days Pharaoh shall lift up your head from off you, and shall hang you on a tree. And the birds shall eat your flesh from off you.

20. And it happened on the third day, Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast to all his servants. And he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer, and of the chief baker, among his servants.

21. And he restored the chief cupbearer back into his cupbearer office again. And he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.

22. But he hanged the chief baker, even as Joseph had interpreted to them.

23. Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.

## Genesis 41

1. And it happened at the end of two years of days, Pharaoh dreamed. And behold, he stood by the river.

2. And behold! There came up out of the river seven cows beautiful of form, and fat of flesh. And they fed in the reeds!

3. And behold! Seven other cows came up after them out of the river, evil in appearance, and lean of flesh! And they stood by the other cows on the river bank.

4. And the evil-appearing and lean-fleshed cows ate up the seven beautifully formed and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.

5. And he slept and dreamed the second time. And behold! Seven ears of grain came up on one stock, fat and good!

6. And behold! Seven thin ears, and blasted with the east [wind], sprang up after them!

7. And the seven thin ears devoured the seven fat and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, [it was] a dream.

8. And it happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men of it. And Pharaoh told them his dream, but [there was] none who could interpret them to Pharaoh.

9. Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, I remember my sin this day.

10. Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me under guard in the chief of the executioner's house, me and the chief baker.

11. And we dreamed a dream one night, he and I. We dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.

12. And there was there with us a young man, a Hebrew, a slave to the chief of the executioners. And we told him, and he interpreted our dreams to us. He interpreted to each man according to his dream.

13. And it happened, as he interpreted to us, so it was. He restored me to my office, and he hanged him.

14. Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph. And they hurried him out of the dungeon. And he shaved and changed his clothing, and came in to Pharaoh.

15. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and none can interpret it. And I have heard it about you, saying, you can understand a dream to interpret it.

16. And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, Not I. God shall answer the welfare of Pharaoh.

17. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, In my dream, behold! I stood upon the bank of the river.

18. And behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, beautiful in appearance and fat of flesh. And they fed in the reeds.

19. And behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and evil of appearance, and lean of flesh, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness.

20. And the lean and the evil-appearing cows ate up the first seven fat cows.

21. And when they had eaten them up, it could not be seen that they had eaten them; but they [were] still evil of appearance, as at the beginning. And I awoke.

22. And I saw in my dream, and behold, seven ears came up in one stock, full and good.

23. And behold, seven ears, withered, thin, blasted [by] the east [wind], sprang up after them.

24. And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears. And I spoke to the magicians, but there was none that could open [it] to me.

25. And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one. God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do.

26. The seven good cows [are] seven years. And the seven good ears [are] seven years. The dream [is] one.

27. And the seven thin and evil-appearing cows that came up after them [are] seven years. And the seven empty ears blasted [with] the east [wind] shall be seven years of famine.

28. This [is] the thing which God has spoken to Pharaoh; what God is about to do, He shows to Pharaoh.

29. Behold, [there are] coming seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt.

30. And there shall arise after them seven years of famine. And all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine shall consume the land.

31. And the plenty shall not be known in the land because of the famine following; for it [shall be] very grievous.

32. And since the dream was repeated to Pharaoh twice, it is because the thing [is] established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.

33. Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a man who is discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.

34. Let Pharaoh act, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.

35. And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.

36. That food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt, so that the land does not perish through the famine.

37. And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.

38. And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find any man like this, [in] whom the Spirit of God [is] ?

39. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Since God has shown you all this, no one [is] as discreet and wise as you.

40. You shall be over my house, and all my people shall kiss [the hand] at your word. Only in the throne will I be greater than you.

41. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.

42. And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand. And he dressed him with fine linen robes, and put a gold chain around his neck.

43. And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had, and they cried before him, Bow the knee! And he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.

44. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I [am] Pharaoh, and without [a word] from you, no man shall lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.

45. And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah. And he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potipherah, priest of On, for his wife. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.

46. And Joseph [was] thirty years [old] when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from before Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.

47. And in the seven years of plenty, the earth brought forth by handfuls.

48. And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which [were] in the land of Egypt, and he put food in the cities. He put the food of the field which [was] around every city; he put it in among it.

49. And Joseph gathered grain like the sand of the sea, very much, until he quit numbering it; for it was without number.

50. And two sons were born to Joseph before the years of famine came, whom Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bore to him.

51. And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh, saying, For God has made me forget all my toil and all my father's house.

52. And the name of the second he called Ephraim, saying, For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

53. And the seven years of plenty that was in the land of Egypt ended.

54. And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said. And the famine was in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.

55. And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. And Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do.

56. And the famine was over all the face of the earth. And Joseph opened all [the storehouses], and sold to the Egyptians. And the famine was severe on the land of Egypt.

57. And all the earth came into Egypt to buy, to Joseph, because the famine was severe in all the earth.

## Genesis 42

1. And when Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, Why do you look upon one another?

2. And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy for us from there, so that we may live and not die.

3. And Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt.

4. But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob did not send with his brothers. For he said, Lest perhaps mischief happen to him.

5. And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

6. And Joseph [was] the potentate over the land. He was] the one selling to all the people of the earth. And Joseph's brothers came and bowed down themselves before him, their faces to the earth.

7. And Joseph saw his brothers, and he knew them, but remained a stranger to them, and spoke roughly to them. And he said to them, Where do you come from? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.

8. And Joseph knew his brothers, but they did not know him.

9. And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said to them, You [are] spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land.

10. And they said to him, No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food.

11. We [are] all one man's sons. We are honest; your servants are not spies.

12. And he said to them, No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land.

13. And they said, Your servants [are] twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan. And behold, the youngest [is] this day with our father, and one [is] not.

14. And Joseph said to them, That [is] what I spoke to you, saying, You [are] spies!

15. By this you shall be proved; [as] Pharaoh lives you shall not go forth from here unless your youngest brother comes here.

16. Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, and you shall be kept in prison so that your words may be proved, whether [any] truth [is] in you. Or else, [as] Pharaoh lives, surely you [are] spies.

17. And he put them together into custody three days.

18. And Joseph said to them the third day, Do [this] and live. I fear God.

19. If you [are] honest, let one of your brothers be bound in the house of your prison. You go carry grain [for] the famine of your houses.

20. But bring your youngest brother to me, and let your words be] confirmed, be proved true, and you shall not die. And they did so.

21. And they said one to another, We [are] truly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he begged us, and we would not hear. Therefore this distress has come upon us.

22. And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you saying, Do not sin against the youth? And you would not hear. Therefore, behold, also his blood is required.

23. And they did not know that Joseph understood, for the interpreter was between them.

24. And he turned from them, and wept. And he returned to them again and talked with them, and took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.

25. Then Joseph commanded their sacks to be filled [with] grain, and returned their silver, each into his sack, and to give them provision for the way. And so he did to them.

26. And they loaded their asses with grain, and departed from there.

27. And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass fodder in the inn, he saw his silver. For, behold, it [was] in the mouth of the sack.

28. And he said to his brothers, My silver has been put back. And, also look in my sack. And their hearts failed, and they each were afraid, saying to one another, What [is] this God has done to us?

29. And they came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all that happened to them, saying,

30. The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.

31. And we said to him, We [are] honest, we [are] not spies.

32. We are twelve brothers, sons of our father. One [is] not, and the youngest [is] this day with our father in the land of Canaan.

33. And the man, the lord of the country, said to us, By this I shall know that you [are] honest. Leave one, your brother, with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and go.

34. And bring your youngest brother to me. Then I shall know that you [are] not spies, but that you [are] honest. And I will deliver you your brother, and you shall trade in the land.

35. And it happened they emptied their sacks, behold, every man's bundle of silver [was] in his sack. And when they and their father saw the bundles of silver, they were afraid.

36. And Jacob their father said to them, You have bereaved me. Joseph [is] not, and Simeon [is] not, and you will take Benjamin. All these things are against me.

37. And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Kill my two sons if I do not bring him to you. Deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to you again.

38. And he said, My son shall not go down with you. For his brother is dead, and he is left alone. And [if] mischief should happen to him by the way you go, then you shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

## Genesis 43

1. And the famine [was] severe in the land.

2. And it happened, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, Go again, buy us a little food.

3. And Judah spoke to him, saying, The man solemnly protested to us, saying, You shall not see my face unless your brother [is] with you.

4. If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food.

5. But if you will not send [him], we will not go down. For the man said to us, You shall not see my face unless your brother [is] with you.

6. And Israel said, Why have you dealt ill with me, to tell the man whether you [had] yet a brother?

7. And they said, The man asked us strictly of our state and of our kindred, saying, [Is] your father still alive? Have you yet [another] brother? And we told him according to the tenor of these words. Could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?

8. And Judah said to Israel his father, Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go, so that we may live and not die, both we and you, also our little ones.

9. I will be surety for him. You shall require him of my hand. If I do not bring him to you and set him before you, I shall be a sinner against you all the days.

10. For unless we had lingered, surely now we would have returned the second time.

11. And their father Israel said to them, If [it be] so now, do this. Take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels, and bring a present down to the man, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds.

12. And take double silver in your hand, and the silver that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand. Perhaps it [was] an oversight.

13. Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man.

14. And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, so that he may send away your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved, I am bereaved.

15. And the men took that present, and they took double silver in their hand, and Benjamin. And they rose up and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.

16. And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring the men into the house, and kill an animal and make ready. For the men shall dine with me at noon.

17. And the man did as Joseph said. And the man brought the men into Joseph's house.

18. And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house. And they said, Because of the silver that was returned in our sacks at the first time we are brought in, to throw himself on us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.

19. And they came near to the man over Joseph's house, and they talked with him at the door of the house,

20. and said, Oh sir, we indeed came down the first time to buy food.

21. And it happened, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, [every] man's silver [was] in the mouth of his sack, our silver in full weight. And we have brought it again in our hands.

22. And we have brought down other silver in our hands to buy food. We cannot tell who put our silver in our sacks.

23. And he said, Peace to you, do not fear. Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks. I had your silver. And he brought Simeon out to them.

24. And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave [them] water, and they washed their feet. And he gave fodder to their asses.

25. And they made ready the presents for the coming of Joseph at noon. For they heard that they should eat bread there.

26. And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.

27. And he asked them as to [their] welfare, and said, [Is] your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? [Is] he still alive?

28. And they answered, Your servant, our father, [is] in good health. He [is] still alive. And they bowed down their heads and fell before him.

29. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, [Is] this your younger brother of whom you spoke to me? And he said, God bless you, my son.

30. And Joseph made haste, for his bowels yearned toward his brother. And he sought a [place] to weep. And he entered into his room and wept there.

31. And he washed his face, and went out, and controlled himself, and said, Set the bread on.

32. And they set it on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians may not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.

33. And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth. And the men marveled at one another.

34. And one took portions to them from before him. But Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.

## Genesis 44

1. And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks [with] food, as much as they can carry, and put each one's silver in his sack's mouth.

2. And put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and his grain silver. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.

3. As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.

4. They had gone out of the city, not having gone far. And Joseph said to his steward, Rise up, follow after the men and overtake them, and say to them, Why have you rewarded evil for good?

5. Is this not [that] in which my lord drinks, and by which indeed he divines? You have done evil in so doing.

6. And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these words.

7. And they said to him, Why does your lord say these words? Far be it that your servants should do according to this thing.

8. Behold, the silver which we found in our sack's mouth, we brought it in to you out of the land of Canaan. How then should we steal out of your lord's house silver or gold?

9. [With] whomever of your servants it may be found, both let him die, and we all will be my lord's bondmen.

10. And he said, Now also [let] it [be] according to your word. He with whom it is found shall be my servant, and you shall be blameless.

11. Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and each one opened his sack.

12. And he searched first at the oldest and with the youngest last. And the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

13. Then they tore their clothes, and each one loaded his ass and returned to the city.

14. And Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, for he [was] still there. And they fell before him to the earth.

15. And Joseph said to them, What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that one like me can certainly divine?

16. And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold, we [are] my lord's servants, both we and he also with whom the cup is found.

17. And he said, Be it far from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant. And as for you, you go in peace to your father.

18. And Judah came near him and said, O my lord, pray let your servant speak a word in my lord's ears, and do not let your anger burn against your servant, for you [are] even as Pharaoh.

19. My lord asked his servants, saying, Do you have a father or a brother?

20. And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one. And his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.

21. And you said to your servants, Bring him down to me, and let me see him.

22. And we said to my lord, The boy cannot leave his father, for [if] he should leave [his father], he would die.

23. And you said to your servants, Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall see my face no more.

24. And it happened when we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.

25. And our father said, Go again. Buy us a little food.

26. And we said, We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, we will go down, for we may not see the man's face unless our youngest brother [is] with us.

27. And your servant my father said to us, You know that my wife bore me two [sons].

28. And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces. And I never saw him since.

29. And [if] you take this one also from me, and mischief befall him, you shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

30. And now when I come to your servant my father, and the boy [is] not with us, since his life is bound up in his life,

31. it shall be, when he sees that the boy [is] not [with us], he will die. And your servants shall bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to the grave.

32. For your servant became surety for the boy to my father, saying, If I do not bring him to you, then I shall bear the blame to my father forever.

33. And now please let your servant remain instead of the boy as a slave to my lord. And let the boy go up with his brothers.

34. For how shall I go up to my father, and the boy [is] not with me lest perhaps I see the evil that will find my father?

## Genesis 45

1. Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him. And he cried, Cause every man to go out from me! And no man stood before him [while] Joseph made himself known to his brothers.

2. And he wept aloud. And the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.

3. And Joseph said to his brothers, I [am] Joseph. Is my father still alive? And his brothers could not answer him, for they were troubled at his presence.

4. And Joseph said to his brothers, Please come near me. And they came near. And he said, I [am] Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.

5. And now do not be grieved, nor angry with yourselves that you sold me here. For God sent me before you to preserve life.

6. For these two years the famine [has been] in the land, and [there are] still five years in which there [will be] no plowing nor harvest.

7. And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

8. And now you did not send me here, but God. And He has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler over all the land of Egypt.

9. Hurry and go up to my father and say to him, So says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me, do not wait.

10. And you shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near to me, you and your sons and your sons' sons, and your flocks, and your herds, and all that you have.

11. And I will nourish you there, for [there are] still five years of famine, lest you and your household, and all that you have, come to poverty.

12. And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that [it is] my mouth that speaks to you.

13. And you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. And you shall hurry and bring down my father here.

14. And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept. And Benjamin wept upon his neck.

15. And he kissed all his brothers, and wept upon them. And afterwards his brothers talked with him.

16. And the report was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brothers have come. And it was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and of his servants.

17. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to your brothers, Do this: load your beasts and go into the land of Canaan,

18. and take your father and your households and come to me. And I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.

19. Now you are commanded; do this. Take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.

20. And do not regard your stuff, for the good of all the land of Egypt [is] yours.

21. And the sons of Israel did so. And Joseph gave them wagons according to the command of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.

22. To all of them he gave each man changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred [pieces] of silver, and five changes of clothing.

23. And to his father he sent this: ten asses loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses loaded with grain and bread and food for his father by the way.

24. And he sent his brothers away, and they departed. And he said to them, Do not quarrel along the way.

25. And they went up out of Egypt, and came [to] the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father.

26. And they told him, saying, Joseph [is] still alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he did not believe them.

27. And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them. And when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived.

28. And Israel said, [It is] enough. Joseph my son [is] still alive. I will go and see him before I die.

## Genesis 46

1. And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.

2. And God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob! And he said, Here I [am].

3. And He said, I [am] God, the God of your fathers. Do not fear to go down into Egypt, for I will make of you a great nation.

4. I will go down with you into Egypt, and I will also surely bring you up again. And Joseph shall put his hand on your eyes.

5. And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba. And the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.

6. And they took their cattle, and their goods which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob and all his seed with him.

7. His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed, he brought with him into Egypt.

8. And these [were] the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's first-born.

9. And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.

10. And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a woman of Canaan.

11. And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

12. And the sons of Judah: Er and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah. But Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez: Hezron and Hamul.

13. And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.

14. And the sons of Zebulun: Sered and Elon and Jahleel.

15. These [were] the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Padan-aram, with his daughter Dinah. All the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty-three.

16. And the sons of Gad [were] Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.

17. And the sons of Asher: Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and their sister Serah. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.

18. These [are] the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these whom she bore to Jacob, sixteen souls.

19. The sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife, were Joseph and Benjamin.

20. And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath the daughter of Potipherah the priest of On bore him.

21. And the sons of Benjamin: Belah and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.

22. These [are] the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob. All the souls [were] fourteen.

23. And the sons of Dan: Hushim.

24. And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.

25. These [were] the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and she bore these to Jacob. All the souls [were] seven.

26. All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, who came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls [were] sixty-six.

27. And the sons of Joseph, who [were] born to him in Egypt, [were] two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob, who came into Egypt, [were] seventy.

28. And he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to direct his face to Goshen.

29. And Joseph made his chariot ready, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself to him. And he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

30. And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen your face, because you [are] still alive.

31. And Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's house, I will go up and show Pharaoh, and say to him, My brothers and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.

32. And the men [are] shepherds, for they have been men of cattle. And they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.

33. And it shall be when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What [is] your occupation?

34. Then you shall say, Your servants have been men of cattle from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers, so that you may live in the land of Goshen, for every shepherd [is] an abomination to the Egyptians.

## Genesis 47

1. Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brothers, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, have come out of the land of Canaan.

2. And behold, they [are] in the land of Goshen. And he took some of his brothers, five men, and presented them to Pharaoh.

3. And Pharaoh said to his brothers, What [is] your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Your servants [are] shepherds, both we and our fathers.

4. And they said to Pharaoh, For we have come to live in the land. For your servants have no pasture left for their flocks. For the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. And now please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.

5. And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Your father and your brothers have come to you.

6. The land of Egypt is before you. Make your father and brothers to live in the best of the land; in the land of Goshen let them live. And if you know men of ability among them, then make them overseers of livestock, over what is mine.

7. And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

8. And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How many are the days of the years of your life?

9. And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage [are] a hundred and thirty years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and I have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.

10. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.

11. And Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh commanded.

12. And Joseph nourished his father and his brothers, and all his father's household, [with] bread, for the mouth of the little ones.

13. And no bread [was] in all the land, for the famine [was] very severe, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted because of the famine.

14. And Joseph gathered up all the silver found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought. And Joseph brought the silver into Pharaoh's house.

15. And when silver failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, Give us bread, for why should we die in your presence? For the silver has failed.

16. And Joseph said, Give your cattle, and I will give you for your cattle, if silver has failed.

17. And they brought their cattle to Joseph. And Joseph gave them bread for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses. And he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.

18. When that year was ended, they came to him the second year and said, We will not hide [it] from my lord, that our silver has failed, also our herds of cattle, [going] to my lord. Nothing is left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies and our lands.

19. Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants for Pharaoh. And give [us] seed, that we may live and not die, that the land be not desolate.

20. And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them and the land became Pharaoh's.

21. And as for the people, he caused them to go into the cities, from [one] end of the borders of Egypt even to the [other] end of it.

22. Only he did not buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. Therefore they did not sell their land.

23. And Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you this day, and your land, for Pharaoh. Lo, [here is] seed for you, and you shall sow the land.

24. And it shall be, as you gather you shall give the fifth [part] to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for those of your household, and for food for your little ones.

25. And they said, You have saved our lives. Let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.

26. And Joseph made it a law of the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth [part], excepting only the land of the priests, which did not become Pharaoh's.

27. And Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they had possession in it, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.

28. And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. And the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty-seven years.

29. And the days of Israel to die drew near. And he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found grace in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me. Please do not bury me in Egypt.

30. But I will lie with my fathers. You shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do according to your words.

31. And he said, Swear to me. And he swore to him. And Israel bowed on the head of the bed.

## Genesis 48

1. And it happened after these things, that [one] told Joseph, Behold, your father [is] sick. And he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.

2. And [one] spoke to Jacob, and said, Behold, your son Joseph comes to you. And Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed.

3. And Jacob said to Joseph, God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me.

4. And He said to me, Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you. And I will make of you a multitude of people, and will give this land to your seed after you [for] an everlasting possession.

5. And now your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who are born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, [are] mine; like Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.

6. And your issue, which you father after them, shall be yours, and shall be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance.

7. And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan in the way, when [there was] still but a little way to come to Ephrath. And I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; it [is] Bethlehem.

8. And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who [are] these?

9. And Joseph said to his father, They [are] my sons, whom God has given me in this [place]. And he said, please bring them to me, and I will bless them.

10. And the eyes of Israel were dim for age; he could not see. And he brought them near him, and he kissed them and embraced them.

11. And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought I would see your face, and, lo, God has showed me also your seed.

12. And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed his face to the earth.

13. And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left, and Manasseh in his left toward Israel's right hand. And he brought [them] near to him.

14. And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid [it] on Ephraim's head, who [was] the younger, and his left on Manasseh's head, crossing his hands. For Manasseh [was] the first-born.

15. And he blessed Joseph and said, May God, [before] whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who fed me all my life to this day,

16. the Angel who redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads. And let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and let them grow like the fishes into a multitude in the midst of the earth.

17. And Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, and it was evil in his eyes. And he held up his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.

18. And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father. For this [is] the first-born. Put your right hand on his head.

19. And his father refused and said, I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great, but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he is, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.

20. And he blessed them that day, saying, In you shall Israel bless, saying, God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh. And he put Ephraim before Manasseh.

21. And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die. But God shall be with you, and bring you again into the land of your fathers.

22. And I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.

## Genesis 49

1. And Jacob called to his sons and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall happen to you in the days to come.

2. Gather yourselves together, and hear, sons of Jacob, and listen to Israel your father.

3. Reuben, you [are] my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power.

4. Unstable as water, you shall not excel, because you went up to your father's bed; then you defiled it. He went up to my couch.

5. Simeon and Levi [are] brothers; tools of violence [are] their weapons.

6. Oh my soul, do not come into their secret. Let not my honor be united with their assembly. For in their anger they killed a man, and in their self-will they hamstrung a bull.

7. Let their anger be cursed, for [it was] fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel. I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.

8. Judah, may your brothers praise you. May your hand [be] in the neck of your enemies. May your father's sons bow before you.

9. Judah [is] a lion's whelp. My son, you have gone up from the prey. He stooped, he crouched like a lion; and like a lioness, who shall rouse him?

10. The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a Lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come. And the obedience of the peoples to him.

11. Binding his foal to the vine, and his ass's colt to the choice vine, he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes.

12. His eyes [shall be] sparkling with wine, and his teeth white from milk.

13. Zebulun shall live at the sea shore. And he [shall be] a haven for ships, and his border beside Sidon.

14. Issachar [is] a strong ass crouching down between the sheepfolds.

15. And he saw that rest [was] good and that the land was pleasant. And he bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a tribute-slave.

16. Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

17. Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that bites the horse's heels, so that its rider shall fall backward.

18. I have waited for Your salvation, O LORD.

19. Gad, raiders shall attack him, and he shall attack [their] heel.

20. Out of Asher his bread [shall be] fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.

21. Naphtali [is] a deer let loose. He gives goodly words.

22. Joseph [is] a fruitful son, a fruitful son by a well, whose branches run over the wall.

23. The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot [at him], and an archer lurks for him.

24. But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob (from the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel);

25. by the God of your father, who shall help you. And may the Almighty bless you with blessings of Heaven above, blessings of the deep that lies beneath, blessings of the breasts and of the womb.

26. The blessings of your father are above the blessings of my ancestors, to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills. They shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him, the ruler, the leader of his brothers.

27. Benjamin is a wolf that tears in pieces. In the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.

28. All these [were] the twelve tribes of Israel. And this [is] what their father spoke to them, and blessed them; everyone according to his blessing he blessed them.

29. And he charged them and said to them, I am to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,

30. in the cave that [is] in the field of Machpelah, which [is] before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, the field which Abraham bought from Ephron the Hittite for a burying-place.

31. They buried Abraham and his wife Sarah there, and they buried Isaac and his wife Rebekah. And I buried Leah there;

32. the purchase of the field and the cave in it, from the sons of Heth.

33. And Jacob finished commanding his sons, and he gathered his feet into the bed. And he expired, and was gathered to his people.

## Genesis 50

1. And Joseph fell on his father's face, and wept on him, and kissed him.

2. And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. And the physicians embalmed Israel.

3. And forty days were fulfilled for him, for so are fulfilled the days of those who are embalmed. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.

4. And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, I pray you speak in the ears of Pharaoh saying,

5. My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die. You shall bury me in my grave which I have dug for me in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, I pray you, let me go up and bury my father, and I will come again.

6. And Pharaoh said, Go up and bury your father, according as he made you swear.

7. And Joseph went up to bury his father. And all the servants of Pharaoh went up with him, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,

8. and all the house of Joseph, and his brothers, and his father's house. They left only their little ones and their flocks and their herds in the land of Goshen.

9. And both chariots and horsemen went up with him. And it was a very great company.

10. And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation. And he made a mourning for his father seven days.

11. And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the grain floor of thorns, and they said, This [is] a grievous mourning to the Egyptians. Therefore they called its name, Meadow of Egypt, which [is] beyond Jordan.

12. And his sons did to him according as he commanded them.

13. For his sons carried him to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a burying place from Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.

14. And Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.

15. And when Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will perhaps hate us, and will certainly repay us all the evil which we did to him.

16. And they sent a message to Joseph, saying, Your father commanded before he died, saying,

17. So shall you say to Joseph, please lift up the rebellion of your brothers, and their sin. For they did evil to you. And please now lift up the rebellion of the servants of the God of your father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.

18. And his brothers also went and fell down before his face. And they said, Behold, we [are] your servants.

19. And Joseph said to them, Do not fear. For [am] I in the place of God?

20. But as for you, you thought evil against me, [but] God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as [it is] this day, to save a great many people alive.

21. And now do not fear. I will nourish you and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke to their hearts.

22. And Joseph lived in Egypt, he and his father's house. And Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.

23. And Joseph saw Ephraim's sons of the third [generation]. Also the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh were born on Joseph's knees.

24. And Joseph said to his brothers, I die. And God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land into the land which He swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

25. And Joseph took an oath of the sons of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.

26. So Joseph died, [being] a hundred and ten years old. And they embalmed him, and put him in a coffin in Egypt.
