# 1 Timothy

## 1 Timothy 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the command of God our Savior, and of [the] Lord Jesus Christ, our hope,

2. to Timothy, [my] own son in [the] faith. Grace, mercy and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.

3. Even as I begged you to remain at Ephesus, when I was going to Macedonia, that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine,

4. nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies (which provide doubts rather than the] nurture of God in faith).

5. But the end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned,

6. from which some, having swerved, have turned aside to foolish talking,

7. desiring to be teachers of the law, neither understanding what they say nor that which they affirm.

8. But we know that the law [is] good if a man uses it lawfully,

9. knowing this, that the law [is] not made for a righteous one, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,

10. for fornicators, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and anything else that is contrary to sound doctrine,

11. according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.

12. And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who strengthened me, because He counted me faithful, putting [me] into the ministry--

13. the [one] who before was a blasphemer and a persecutor and insolent. But I obtained mercy, because being ignorant, I did [it] in unbelief.

14. [And] the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.

15. Faithful [is] the Word and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.

16. But for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, as a pattern to those being about to believe on Him to life everlasting.

17. Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, [the] only wise God, [be] honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.

18. This charge I commit to you, [my] son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before [about] you, in order that you might war a good warfare by them,

19. holding faith and a good conscience, which some have put away and made shipwreck as to faith.

20. Among these are Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan so that they may learn not to blaspheme.

## 1 Timothy 2

1. First of all, then, I exhort [that] supplications, prayers, intercessions, [and] giving of thanks be made for all men,

2. for kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and reverence.

3. For this [is] good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,

4. who will have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

5. For God [is] one, and [there is] one Mediator of God and of man, [the] Man Christ Jesus,

6. who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.

7. To this I am ordained a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie), a teacher of [the] nations, in faith and truth.

8. Therefore, I desire that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.

9. In the same way also, I desire that women adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and sensibleness, not [adorned] with braiding, or gold, or pearls, or costly clothing,

10. but with good works, which becomes women professing godliness.

11. Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.

12. But I do not allow a woman to teach, or to exercise authority [over] a man, but to be in silence.

13. For Adam was first formed, then Eve.

14. And Adam was not deceived, but [the] woman being deceived was in the transgression.

15. But she will be kept safe through childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with sensibleness.

## 1 Timothy 3

1. Faithful [is] the word: If anyone reaches out to overseership, he desires a good work.

2. Then it behooves the overseer to be without reproach, husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, well-ordered, hospitable, apt at teaching,

3. not a drunkard, not contentious, not greedy of ill gain, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous,

4. ruling his own house well, having children in subjection with all honor.

5. (For if a man does not know to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)

6. not a novice, lest being puffed up he may fall into the condemnation of the Devil.

7. But he must also have a good report from those on the outside, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the Devil.

8. Likewise the deacons [are to be] reverent, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of ill gain,

9. having the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.

10. And let these also first be tested, then let them minister without reproach.

11. Even so [their] wives are to [be] reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.

12. Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling [their] children and households well.

13. For they having served well gain a good grade for themselves, and much boldness in the faith, those in Christ Jesus.

14. I write these things to you, hoping to come to you shortly.

15. But if I should delay, that you may know how you ought to behave in the house of God, which is [the] church of the living God, [the] pillar and foundation of the truth.

16. And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among nations, believed on in [the] world, and received up into glory.

## 1 Timothy 4

1. But the Spirit expressly says that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and teachings of demons,

2. speaking lies in hypocrisy, being seared in [their] own conscience,

3. forbidding to marry, [saying] to abstain from foods which God has created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.

4. For every creation of God [is] good, and nothing to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving.

5. For it is sanctified through the Word of God and prayer.

6. Having suggested these things to the brothers, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and by the good doctrine which you have followed.

7. But refuse profane and old-womanish tales, and exercise yourself to godliness.

8. For bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the present life, and of that which is to come.

9. Faithful [is] the Word, and worthy of all acceptance.

10. For to this we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the preserver of all men, especially of those who believe.

11. Command and teach these things.

12. Let no one despise your youth, but be an example of the believers, in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.

13. Until I come, attend to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.

14. Do not neglect the gift in you, which was given you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the body of elders.

15. Meditate on these things; be in these things in order that your improvement may appear to all.

16. Hold on to yourself and to the doctrine; continue in them, for doing this you shall both save yourself and those who hear you.

## 1 Timothy 5

1. Do not sharply rebuke an elder, but exhort as a father, [and] the younger ones as brothers,

2. older women as mothers, the younger as sisters in all purity.

3. Honor widows who are widows indeed.

4. But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to be godly to their own house, and give back to [their] forebears what is due them; for that is good and pleasing before God.

5. But she being really a widow, and having been left alone, has set her] hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.

6. But she who lives in self-pleasure has died while living.

7. And command these things so that they may be blameless.

8. But if anyone does not provide for [his] own, and especially [his] family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.

9. Do not let a widow be enrolled having become less than sixty years old, [the] wife of one man,

10. well reported of for good works: if she brought up children, if she lodged strangers, if she washed the feet of saints, if she relieved the afflicted, if she followed after every good work.

11. But refuse younger widows, for whenever they grow lustful against Christ, they desire to marry;

12. having guilt because they have cast off the first faith.

13. And with it all they also learn [to be] idle, going around the houses; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things they ought not.

14. Therefore I want the younger ones to marry, bear children, guide the house, giving no occasion to the adversary because of reproach.

15. For some have already turned aside after Satan.

16. If any believing man or believing woman has widows, let them relieve them, and do not let the church be charged, so that it may relieve those who are widows indeed.

17. Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and doctrine.

18. For the Scripture says, You shall not muzzle the ox treading out grain, and, The laborer [is] worthy of his reward.

19. Do not receive an accusation against an elder except before two or three witnesses.

20. Those who sin, rebuke before all, so that the rest also may fear.

21. I charge [you] before God and [the] Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you guard these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.

22. Do not lay hands quickly on anyone, neither be partaker of [the] sins of others. Keep yourself pure.

23. Drink water no longer, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake, and for your frequent infirmities.

24. Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment. And some they also follow after.

25. Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand, and those who are otherwise cannot be hidden.

## 1 Timothy 6

1. Let as many slaves as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, so that the name and doctrine of God may not be blasphemed.

2. And those who have believing masters, let them not despise [them] because they are brothers. But rather let them serve, because they are faithful and beloved, those of the good service receiving in return. Teach and exhort these things.

3. If anyone teaches otherwise, and does not consent to wholesome words (those of our Lord Jesus Christ), and to the doctrine according to godliness,

4. he is proud, knowing nothing. [He is] sick concerning doubts and arguments, from which comes envy, strife, evil speakings, evil suspicions,

5. meddling, of men whose minds have been corrupted and deprived of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness. Withdraw from such.

6. But godliness with contentment is great gain.

7. For we brought nothing into the world, [and it is] clear that we can carry nothing out.

8. But having food and clothing, we will be content.

9. But they who will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and [into] many foolish and hurtful lusts which plunge men into destruction and perdition.

10. For the love of money is a root of all evils, of which some having lusted after, they were seduced from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

11. But you, O man of God, flee these things and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and meekness.

12. Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold on eternal life, to which you are also called and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.

13. I charge you before God (who makes all things alive) and [in the sight of] Christ Jesus (who witnessed the good confession to Pontius Pilate),

14. that you keep the commandment without spot and without blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.

15. For He in His own time will reveal [who is] the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords,

16. who alone has immortality, dwelling in light which cannot be approached, whom no one of men have seen, nor can see; to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.

17. Charge the rich in this world that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, He offering to us richly all things to enjoy,

18. that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to share, to be generous,

19. laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.

20. O Timothy, guard the Deposit, avoiding profane [and] vain babblings, and oppositions of falsely-named science,

21. which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace [be] with you. Amen.
