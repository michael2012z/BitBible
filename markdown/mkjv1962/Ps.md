# Psalms

## Psalms 1

1. Blessed [is] the man who has not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, and has not stood in the way of sinners, and has not sat in the seat of the scornful.

2. But his delight [is] only in the law of the LORD; and in His law he meditates day and night.

3. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivulets of water that brings forth its fruit in its seasons, and its leaf shall not wither, and all which he does shall be blessed.

4. The wicked [are] not so, but [are] like chaff which the wind drives away.

5. Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

6. For the LORD knows the way of the righteous; but the way of the ungodly shall perish.

## Psalms 2

1. Why do the nations rage, and the peoples meditate on a vain thing?

2. The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers plot together, against the LORD and against His anointed, [saying] ,

3. Let us break their bands in two and cast away their cords from us.

4. He who sits in the heavens shall laugh; the LORD shall mock at them.

5. Then He shall speak to them in His anger, and trouble them in His wrath.

6. Yea, I have set My king on My holy hill, on Zion.

7. I will declare the decree of the LORD. He has said to Me, You [are] My Son; today I have begotten You.

8. Ask of Me, and I shall give the nations [for] Your inheritance; and the uttermost parts of the earth for Your possession.

9. You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.

10. And now be wise, O kings; be instructed, O judges of the earth.

11. Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

12. Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and you perish [from] the way, when His wrath is kindled in but a little time. Blessed [are] all who put their trust in Him.

## Psalms 3

1. A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom. O Lord, how my foes have increased! Many [are] the ones who rise up against me.

2. Many are saying of my soul, [There is] no deliverance for him in God. Selah.

3. But You, O LORD, [are] a shield for me; my glory, the One who lifts up my head.

4. I cried to the LORD with my voice, and He heard me out of His holy hill. Selah.

5. I laid down and slept. I awoke, for the LORD kept me.

6. I am not afraid of ten thousands of people who have set against me all around.

7. Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God; for You have struck all my enemies [on] the cheekbone. You have broken the teeth of the ungodly.

8. Salvation [belongs] to the LORD. Your blessing [is] on Your people. Selah.

## Psalms 4

1. To the Chief Musician, for stringed instruments. A Psalm of David. Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness; You gave room to me in trouble; have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.

3. But know that the LORD has set apart the godly for Himself. The LORD hears when I call to Him.

4. Tremble, and sin not; speak within your own heart on your bed and be still. Selah.

5. Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and trust in the LORD.

6. There [are] many who say, Who will show us [any] good? LORD, lift up the light of Your face on us.

7. You have put gladness in my heart, more than in the time [that] their grain and their wine increased.

8. I will lie down, both in peace and in sleep. For You alone, LORD, make me dwell in safety.

## Psalms 5

1. To the Chief Musician, for flutes. A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O LORD; consider my meditation.

2. Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God; for to You I will pray.

3. My voice You shall hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning I will direct [my prayer] to You, and I will look up.

4. For You [are] not a God that enjoys wickedness; nor shall evil dwell with You.

5. The foolish shall not stand in Your sight. You hate all doers of iniquity.

6. You shall destroy those who speak lies; the LORD will despise the bloody and deceitful man.

7. But I, in the abundance of Your grace, I will come [into] Your house; I will worship in Your fear toward Your holy temple.

8. Lead me, O LORD, in Your righteousness, because of my enemies; make Your way straight before my face.

9. For [there is] no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is wickedness; their throat [is] an open grave; they flatter with their tongue.

10. Hold them guilty, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions, for they have rebelled against You.

11. But let all who put their trust in You rejoice; let them always shout for joy, because You defend them. And let those who love Your name be joyful in You.

12. For You; O LORD, will bless the righteous; with favor You will surround him as [with] a shield.

## Psalms 6

1. To the Chief Musician, for eight-stringed instruments. A Psalm of David. O LORD, rebuke me not in Your anger, nor chasten me in the heat of Your fury.

2. Have mercy on me, O LORD, for I [am] weak; O LORD, heal me, for my bones are troubled.

3. My soul also is exceedingly troubled; but You, O LORD, how long?

4. Return, O LORD, return; deliver my soul; save me for Your mercy's sake.

5. For in death [there is] no memory of You; in the grave who shall give You thanks?

6. I am weary in my groaning; all the night I make my bed swim; I melt my couch with my tears.

7. My eye is dim because of grief; it wastes away because of all my enemies.

8. Depart from me, all workers of iniquity; for the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping.

9. The LORD has heard my cry; the LORD will receive my prayer.

10. Let all my enemies be ashamed and exceedingly troubled; let them turn back [and] be ashamed in a moment.

## Psalms 7

1. A song of David, which he sang to the LORD, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite. O LORD my God, in You I put my trust; save me from all who pursue me, and deliver me,

2. lest he tear my soul like a lion, tearing [it] in pieces, and there is no one to deliver.

3. O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there is iniquity in my hands;

4. if I have rewarded evil to my friend, or if I have delivered one] oppressing me without cause;

5. let the enemy persecute my soul and take [it]; yea, let him trample down my life on the earth and lay my honor in the dust. Selah.

6. Arise, O LORD, in Your anger; lift up Yourself because of the rage of my enemies, and awake for me [to] the judgment which You have commanded.

7. And the congregation of the peoples shall surround You; and over it You will return on high.

8. The LORD shall judge the people; judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to my integrity on me.

9. O let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish the just. For the righteous God tries the minds and hearts.

10. My defense [is] from God, who saves the upright in heart.

11. God judges the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.

12. If he does not turn, He will whet His sword; He has bent His bow and made it ready.

13. Yea, He has fitted him for instruments of death; He has made His arrows hotly pursue.

14. Behold, he labors in pain with iniquity, and he has conceived mischief, and has brought forth falsehood.

15. He dug a pit and bored it, and has fallen into the ditch [which] he made.

16. His mischief shall return on his own head, and his violence shall come on his own crown.

17. I will praise the LORD according to His righteousness, and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.

## Psalms 8

1. To the Chief Musician, on the harp. A Psalm of David. O Jehovah our Lord, how excellent [is] Your name in all the earth! [You] have set Your glory above the heavens!

2. Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings You have ordained strength, because of ones] vexing You, to cause the enemy and the avenger to cease.

3. When I look at Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars which You have established;

4. what is man that You are mindful of him, and the son of man, that You visit him?

5. For You have made him lack a little from God, and have crowned him with glory and honor.

6. You made him rule over the works of Your hands; You have put all [things] under his feet:

7. all sheep and oxen, yes, and the beasts of the field;

8. the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, and [all that] pass through the paths of the seas.

9. O Jehovah, our Lord, how excellent [is] Your name in all the earth!

## Psalms 9

1. To the Chief Musician. To die for the Son. A Psalm of David. I will praise [You], O LORD, with my whole heart; I will tell of all Your marvelous works.

2. I will be glad and rejoice in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.

3. When my enemies have turned back, they shall fall and perish before You.

4. For You have maintained my right and my cause; You sat in the throne judging right.

5. You have rebuked the heathen, You have destroyed the wicked, You have put out their name forever and ever.

6. The desolations of the enemy have come to an end forever, and You have destroyed the cities; their memorial has perished with them.

7. But the LORD shall endure forever; He has prepared His throne for judgment.

8. And He shall judge the world in righteousness; He shall judge the peoples in uprightness.

9. The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.

10. And those who know Your name will put their trust in You; for You, LORD, have not forsaken those who seek You.

11. Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion; declare among the nations His deeds.

12. For He remembers them, the seekers of bloodshed; He forgets not the cry of the humble.

13. Have mercy on me, O LORD; see my trouble from those who hate me, You who lift me up from the gates of death,

14. so that I may declare all Your praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion; I will rejoice in Your salvation.

15. The nations have sunk down in the pit [that] they made; their foot is caught in the net which they hid.

16. The LORD is known. He has executed judgment; the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. A meditation. Selah.

17. The wicked shall be turned into hell, all the nations that forget God.

18. For the needy shall not always be forgotten; the hope of the poor shall [not] perish forever.

19. Arise, O LORD; let not man be strong. Let the nations be judged in Your sight.

20. Put them in fear, O LORD, let the nations know they [are] but men. Selah.

## Psalms 10

1. Why do You stand afar off, O LORD? Will You hide in times of trouble?

2. The wicked in [his] pride persecutes the poor; let them be taken in the plans that they have imagined.

3. For the wicked boasts of his heart's desire, and blesses the covetous [whom] the LORD despises.

4. Through the pride of his face the wicked will not seek [Him]; There [is] no God in all his schemes.

5. His ways are always perverted; Your judgments [are] high, out of his sight. [As for] all his enemies, he puffs at them.

6. He has said in his heart, I shall not be moved; from generation to generation, never in evil!

7. His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud; under his tongue [are] mischief and vanity.

8. He sits in the hiding-places of the villages; in the secret places he murders the innocent. His eyes are secretly set against the poor.

9. He lies in wait secretly, like a lion in his den. He lies in wait to catch the poor; he catches the poor when he draws him into his net.

10. He crouches and bows, and the poor have fallen by his might.

11. He has said in his heart, God has forgotten; He hides His face; He will not see forever!

12. Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up Your hand; forget not the humble.

13. Why do the wicked condemn God? He has said in his heart, You will not judge.

14. You have seen [it]; for You behold mischief and vexation, to repay [it] with Your hand. The poor commits [himself] to You; You are the Helper of the fatherless.

15. Break the arm of the wicked and the evil one; seek out his wickedness, [until] You find none.

16. The LORD [is] King forever and ever; the nations have perished out of His land.

17. LORD, You have heard the desire of the humble; You will prepare their heart, You will cause Your ear to hear,

18. to judge the fatherless and the oppressed, so that the man of the earth may no more terrify.

## Psalms 11

1. To the Chief Musician. [A Psalm] of David. I put my trust in the LORD; how can you say to me, Flee [like] a bird to the mountains;

2. for lo, the wicked bend [their] bow; they make ready their arrow on the string, so that they may secretly shoot at the upright in heart.

3. If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?

4. The LORD [is] in His holy temple; the LORD's throne [is] in Heaven; His eyes behold, His eyelids examine the children of men.

5. The LORD tries the righteous; but His soul hates the wicked and the one who loves violence,

6. On the wicked He shall rain snares, fire and brimstone; and a horrible tempest [shall be] the portion of their cup.

7. For the righteous LORD loves righteousness; His face looks on the upright.

## Psalms 12

1. To the Chief Musician, on eight. A Psalm of David. Help, LORD, for the godly man ceases; for the faithful fail from among the sons of men.

2. They speak vanity each one with his neighbor; [with] flattering lips and a double heart they speak.

3. The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaks proud things,

4. that has said, With our tongue we shall do much; our lips [are] our own; who [is] lord over us?

5. For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, I will now arise, says the LORD. I will set in safety, he pants for it.

6. The words of the LORD [are] pure words, [like] silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.

7. You shall keep them, O LORD, You shall preserve them from this generation forever.

8. The wicked walk on every side, when vileness is praised by the sons of men.

## Psalms 13

1. To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. How long will You forget me, O LORD? Forever? How long will You hide Your face from me?

2. How long shall I take counsel in my heart [having] sorrow in my heart daily? How long shall my enemy be lifted up over me?

3. Look! Answer me, O LORD my God; enlighten my eyes, lest I sleep the [sleep of] death,

4. lest my enemy say, I have overcome him, and my foes rejoice when I am shaken.

5. But I have trusted in Your mercy; my heart shall rejoice in Your salvation.

6. I will sing to the LORD, because He has rewarded me.

## Psalms 14

1. To the Chief Musician. [A Psalm] of David. The fool has said in his heart, [There is] no God! They acted corruptly; they have done abominable works, [there is] none who does good.

2. The LORD looked down from Heaven on the sons of men, to see if there were any who understood [and] sought God.

3. All [have] gone aside, together they are filthy; [there is] none who does good, no, not one.

4. Have all the workers of iniquity not known, eating up My people [as] they eat bread? They have not called on the LORD.

5. There they were in great fear; for God [is] in the generation of the righteous.

6. You have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD [is] his refuge.

7. Who will bring the salvation of Israel out of Zion? When the LORD brings back the captivity of His people, Jacob shall rejoice, [and] Israel shall be glad.

## Psalms 15

1. A Psalm of David. LORD, who shall dwell in Your tabernacle? Who shall dwell on Your holy hill?

2. He who walks uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart;

3. [he] does not backbite with his tongue, nor do evil to his neighbor, nor take up a reproach against his neighbor;

4. in whose eyes the reprobate is despised, but he honors those who fear the LORD; [he] has sworn to his hurt, and does not change it;

5. [he] has not put out his money at interest, nor has he taken a bribe against the innocent. He who does these [things] shall not be moved forever.

## Psalms 16

1. A Secret Treasure of David. Watch over me, O God; for in You do I put my trust.

2. [Oh my soul,] you have said to the LORD, You [are] my Lord; I have no goodness apart from You.

3. As to the saints in the earth, they [are] the excellent, in whom [is] all my delight.

4. Their sorrows shall be multiplied [who] run after another [god]. I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood; and I will not take their names on my lips.

5. The LORD [is] the portion of my inheritance, and of my cup; You shall uphold my lot.

6. The lines have fallen to me in pleasant [places]; yea, I have a beautiful inheritance.

7. I will bless the LORD, who has given me wisdom; my heart also instructs me [in] the nights.

8. I have set the LORD always before Me; because [He is] at My right hand, I shall not be moved.

9. Therefore My heart is glad, and My glory rejoices; My flesh also shall rest in hope;

10. For You will not leave My soul in hell; You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption.

11. You will make Me know the way of life; in Your presence [is] fullness of joys. At Your right hand [are] pleasures forevermore.

## Psalms 17

1. A Prayer of David. Hear the right, O LORD; listen to my cry; Give ear to my prayer, [for it is] not in lips of deceit.

2. Let my judgment go out from Your presence; let Your eyes behold uprightly.

3. You have proved my heart; You have visited [me] in the night; You have tried me, and You will find nothing; my thoughts do not pass beyond my mouth.

4. Concerning the works of men, by the words of Your lips, I am kept [from] the paths of the destroyer.

5. My steps have been held in Your paths, [so that] my footsteps have not slipped.

6. I have called on You, for You will hear me, O God; bow down Your ear to me; [hear] my speech.

7. Set out Your wonderful loving-kindness, O Savior of those seeking refuge [in You], by Your right hand, from those who rise up against [me].

8. Keep me as the pupil, the daughter of the eye; hide me under the shadow of Your wings,

9. from the face of the wicked who strip me. [Those] against [my] soul, My foes, encircle me.

10. They are enclosed in their own fat; with their mouth they speak proudly,

11. They have now hemmed in our steps. They have set their eyes to bow [me] to the earth,

12. Their likeness is like a lion [that] longs to tear, and like a young lion lurking in secret places.

13. Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, bow him down; deliver my soul from the wicked by Your sword,

14. from men by Your hand, O LORD, from men of the world whose portion is in [this] life, and whose belly You fill with Your treasure. They are satisfied with sons, and will leave their riches to their babes.

15. [As for] me, I will behold Your face in righteousness; when I awake, I shall be satisfied with Your image.

## Psalms 18

1. To the Chief Musician. [A Psalm] of David, the servant of the LORD, who spoke to the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul; and he said: I love You, O LORD, my strength.

2. The LORD [is] my strength, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my rock; I will trust in Him; [He is] my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.

3. I will call on the LORD, [who is worthy] to be praised; so shall I be saved from my enemies.

4. The sorrows of death hemmed me in, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.

5. The sorrows of hell surrounded me; the snares of death confronted me.

6. In my distress I called on the LORD, and I cried to my God; He heard my voice out of His temple, and my cry came before Him, into His ears.

7. Then the earth shook and trembled; and the foundations of the hills moved and were shaken, because He was angry.

8. A smoke went up out of His nostrils, and fire devoured out of His mouth; coals were kindled by it.

9. And He bowed the heavens and came down, and darkness [was] under His feet.

10. And He rode on a cherub, and flew; yea, He soared on the wings of the wind.

11. He made darkness His secret place, His pavilion around Him, darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.

12. At the brightness before Him, His dark clouds passed through, hailstones and coals of fire passed.

13. The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave forth His voice; hailstones and coals of fire.

14. Yea, He sent out His arrows and scattered them; and He shot out lightnings and crushed them.

15. Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were uncovered, at Your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.

16. He sent from above, He took me, He drew me out of many waters.

17. He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from those who hated me; for they were too strong for me.

18. They went before me in the day of my calamity; but the LORD was my stay.

19. He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me because He delighted in me.

20. The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands He has repaid me.

21. For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.

22. For all His judgments [were] before me, and I did not put away His statutes from me.

23. I was also upright before Him, and I kept myself from my iniquity.

24. And the LORD has returned to me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in His eyes.

25. With the merciful, You will show Yourself merciful; with an upright man You will show Yourself upright;

26. with the pure You will show Yourself pure; and with the crooked You will show Yourself perverse.

27. For You will save the afflicted people, but will bring down high looks.

28. For You will light my candle; the LORD my God will make my darkness light.

29. For by You I have run through a troop; and by my God I have leaped over a wall.

30. [As for] God, His way [is] perfect; the Word of the LORD [is] tried; He [is] a shield to all those who trust in Him.

31. For who [is] God besides Jehovah? Or, who [is] a Rock except our God?

32. [It is] God who girds me with strength and makes my way perfect.

33. He makes my feet like hinds' feet, and sets me on my high places.

34. He teaches my hands to war, so that a bow of bronze is bent by my arms.

35. You have also given me the shield of Your salvation; and Your right hand has held me up, and Your gentleness has made me great.

36. You have given a wide place for my steps under me, so that my feet have not slipped.

37. I have pursued my enemies and overtaken them; nor did I turn again until they were destroyed.

38. I have shattered them, and they cannot rise again; they have fallen under my feet.

39. For You have girded me with strength for the battle; You have humbled under me those who rose up against me.

40. You have also given me the neck of my enemies; so that I might destroy those who hate me.

41. They cried, but there [was] none to save; [even] to the LORD, but He did not answer them.

42. Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind; I cast them out like the dirt in the streets.

43. You have delivered Me from the strivings of the people; You have made Me the head of the nations; a people [whom] I have not known shall serve Me.

44. As soon as they hear of Me, they shall obey Me; the sons of strangers shall bow down to Me.

45. The sons of strangers shall fade away and be afraid out of their strongholds.

46. The LORD lives; and blessed [be] my rock, and let the God of my salvation be praised.

47. [It is] God who avenges me, and humbles the people under me.

48. He delivers me from my enemies; yea, You lift me up above those who rise up against me; You have delivered me from the violent man.

49. Therefore I will give thanks to You, O LORD, among the nations, and sing praises to Your name,

50. magnifying the salvations to His king, and working mercy to His anointed, to David, and to his seed forevermore.

## Psalms 19

1. To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; and the expanse proclaims His handiwork.

2. Day to day pours forth speech, and night to night reveals knowledge.

3. [There is] no speech nor [are] there words; their voice is not heard.

4. Their line has gone out through all the earth and their words to the end of the world. In them He has set a tabernacle for the sun,

5. and he comes forth as a bridegroom from his canopy; he rejoices as a strong man to run a race,

6. going forth from the end of the heavens, and its course [is] to their ends. And there is nothing hid from its heat.

7. The law of the LORD [is] perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the LORD [is] sure, making the simple wise.

8. The statutes of the LORD [are] right, rejoicing the heart; the commandments of the LORD [are] pure, giving light to the eyes.

9. The fear of the LORD [is] clean, enduring forever; the judgments of the LORD [are] true [and] righteous altogether,

10. more to be desired than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

11. And Your servant is warned by them; in keeping them there [is] great reward.

12. Who can understand [his] errors? Oh make me pure from secret [faults] ;

13. and keep Your servant back from presumptuous [sins]; do not let them rule over me; then I shall be upright, and I shall be innocent of great transgression.

14. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in Your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer.

## Psalms 20

1. To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. May the LORD hear you in the day of trouble, the name of the God of Jacob set you on high,

2. sending you help from the sanctuary, and upholding you out of Zion.

3. He will remember all your offerings, and accept your burnt sacrifice. Selah.

4. May He grant you according to your own heart, and fulfill all your plans.

5. We will rejoice in your salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up banners; may the LORD fulfill all your prayers.

6. Now I know that the LORD saves His anointed; He will hear him from His holy Heaven with the saving strengths of His right hand.

7. Some [trust] in chariots, and some in horses; but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.

8. They have bowed down and fallen; but we have risen and stand upright.

9. Save, O LORD; let the King hear us when we call.

## Psalms 21

1. To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The king shall rejoice in Your strength, O LORD; and in Your salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!

2. You have given him his heart's desire, and have not withheld the prayer of his lips. Selah.

3. For You go before him [with] the blessings of goodness; You set a crown of pure gold on his head.

4. He asked life from You; You give to him length of days forever and ever.

5. His glory [is] great in Your salvation; honor and majesty You have laid on him.

6. For You have made him most blessed forever; You have rejoiced him in the gladness in Your holy face.

7. For the king trusts in the LORD, and in the mercy of the Most High; he shall not be moved.

8. Your hand shall find out all Your enemies; Your right hand shall find out those who hate You.

9. You shall make them as a fiery oven in the time of Your presence; the LORD will swallow them up in His wrath, and the fire shall devour them.

10. Their fruit shall You destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the sons of men.

11. For they intended evil against You; they imagined a wicked thing; they are not able to prevail.

12. For You shall make them turn the back; You shall make ready [Your arrows] on Your strings against their faces.

13. Be exalted, O LORD, in Your strength; we will sing, and praise Your power.

## Psalms 22

1. To the Chief Musician, on the deer of the dawn. A Psalm of David. My God, my God, why have You forsaken me, and [are] far from my deliverance, [and from] the words of my groaning?

2. O my God, I cry in the daytime, but You do not answer; and in the night, and am not silent.

3. But You [are] holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel.

4. Our fathers trusted in You; they trusted, and You delivered them.

5. They cried to You, and were delivered; they trusted in You, and were not ashamed.

6. But I [am] a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised by the people.

7. All who see Me mock me; they shoot out the lip; they shake the head, [saying] ,

14. I am poured out like water, and all My bones are spread apart; My heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of My bowels.

15. My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and My tongue clings to My jaws;

16. and You have brought Me into the dust of death. For dogs have circled around Me; the band of spoilers have hemmed Me in, piercers of My hands and My feet.

17. I can count all My bones; they look [and] stare at Me.

18. They divide My garments among them and cast lots for My clothing.

19. But You, O LORD, be not far from Me; O My strength, hurry to help Me!

31. They shall come, and shall declare His righteousness to a people that shall [yet] be born, that He has done [this].

7. For my loins are filled with a burning; and there [is] no soundness in my flesh.

8. I am feeble and painfully broken; I have roared because of the groanings of my heart.

9. My Lord, all my desire [is] before You; and my sighing is not hidden from You.

10. My heart pants; my strength fails me; as for the light of my eyes, it also is gone from me.

11. My lovers and my friends stand apart from my plague; and my neighbors stand far off.

12. And those who seek my life lay snares [for me]; and those who seek my hurt speak sly things, and utter deceits all the day long.

13. But like a deaf one, I do not hear; and I [am] like a dumb one who opens not his mouth.

14. And I am as a man who hears not, and in whose mouth [are] no reproofs.

15. For in You, O LORD, do I hope; You will hear, O LORD my God.

16. For I said, [Hear me], lest they rejoice over me; when my foot slips, they magnify themselves against me.

17. For I [am] ready to fall, and my pain [is] always before me.

18. For I will declare my iniquity; I am anxious from my sin.

19. And my enemies [are] lively; they are strong; and my haters increase [by] deception.

20. And those who give evil for good oppose me, because I follow good.

21. Forsake me not, O LORD; O my God, be not far from me.

22. Make haste to help me, O my LORD, my salvation.

## Psalms 39

1. To the Chief Musician, to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. I said, I will take heed to my ways so that I do not sin with my tongue; I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked [are] before me.

2. I became dumb, keeping still; I was silent, from good; and my pain was stirred.

3. My heart was hot within me; while I was musing, the fire burned; I spoke with my tongue:

4. O LORD, make me to know my end, and the measure of my days, what it [is]; I know how frail I [am].

5. Behold, You have made my days [as] a handbreadth, and my age [is] as nothing before You. Surely every man standing [is] altogether vanity. Selah.

6. Surely a man walks about like a shadow! Surely they are in an uproar in vain. He heaps up, and does not know who shall gather them.

7. And now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope [is] in You.

8. Deliver me from all my transgressions; make me not the reproach of the fool.

9. I was dumb, I did not open my mouth; because You have done [it].

10. Remove Your stroke away from me; I am destroyed by the blow of Your hand.

11. You correct a man for iniquity with rebukes, and you make his desires vanish away like a moth. Surely every man [is] vanity. Selah.

12. Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry. Do not be silent at my tears; for I [am] a stranger with You, a pilgrim, as all my fathers [were].

13. Look away from me, and I will smile before I go away and be no more.

## Psalms 40

1. To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for the LORD; and He bowed down to me, and heard my cry.

2. He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay, [and] set my feet on a rock, and gave sureness to my steps.

3. And He has put a new song in my mouth, praise to our God; many shall see [it] and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.

4. Blessed [is] the man who makes the LORD his trust and does not turn to the proud, nor to those who turn aside [to] a lie.

5. O LORD my God, many things You have done, Your wonderful works and Your thoughts [which] [are] toward us; they cannot be set in order to You; I will declare and speak, for they are more than can be numbered.

6. Sacrifice and offering You did not desire; My ears You have opened; burnt offering and sin offering You have not asked.

7. Then I said, Lo, I come, in the volume of the Book [it is] written of Me;

8. I delight to do Your will, O My God; and Your law [is] within My heart.

9. I have preached righteousness in the great congregation; lo, I have not kept back My lips, O LORD, You know.

10. I have not hidden Your righteousness within my heart; I have declared Your faithfulness and Your salvation; I have not hidden Your loving-kindness and Your truth from the great congregation.

11. Do not withhold Your tender mercies from me, O LORD; let Your loving-kindness and Your truth always watch over me.

12. For evils without number have hemmed me in; my sins have taken hold on me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails me.

13. Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; O LORD, make haste to help me.

14. Let them be ashamed and humbled together, those who seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame, those who wish me evil.

15. Let them be desolate as a reward for their shame, those who say to me, Aha, aha!

16. Let all those who seek You rejoice and be glad in You, and the ones loving your salvation always say, Let the LORD be magnified.

17. But I [am] poor and needy; the LORD will care for me; You [are] my help and my deliverer; O my God, do not wait.

## Psalms 41

1. To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Blessed [is] he who acts wisely toward the poor; the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.

2. The LORD will watch over him and keep him alive; [and] he shall be blessed on the earth; and You will not deliver him to the soul of his enemies.

3. The LORD will hold him up on the bed of sickness; You will change all his bed in his illness.

4. I said, LORD, be merciful to me; heal my soul; for I have sinned against You.

5. My enemies speak evil of me, [saying], When will he die, and his name perish?

6. And when he comes to see [me], he speaks vanity; his heart gathers iniquity to itself; he goes out and speaks of it.

7. All my haters me whisper against me; they plot evil against me.

8. They say, a wicked thing is poured out on him, and he who lies down shall rise no more.

9. Even a man, my friend, in whom I trusted, who ate of my bread, has lifted up [his] heel against me.

10. But You, O LORD, be merciful to me, and raise me up, so that I may repay them.

11. By this I know that You delight in me, because my enemy does not triumph over me.

12. And I, in my integrity You uphold me; and You set me before Your face forever.

13. Blessed [is] the LORD God of Israel, from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen and Amen!

## Psalms 42

1. To the Chief Musician. A contemplation; for the sons of Korah. As the hart pants after the water brooks, so my soul pants after You, O God.

2. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; when shall I come and appear before God?

3. My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all the day, Where [is] your God?

4. When I remember these [things], I pour out my soul on me; for I had gone with the multitude; I went with them to the house of God with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping the feast.

5. Why are you cast down, O my soul, and moan within me? Hope in God; for I shall praise Him [for] the salvation of His face.

6. O my God, my soul is cast down within me; therefore I will remember You from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermons, from mount Mizar.

7. Deep calls to deep at the noise of Your waterfalls; all Your waves and Your billows have gone over me.

8. The LORD will command His loving-kindness in the daytime, and in the night His song [shall be] with me, my prayer to the God of my life.

9. I will say to God my rock, Why have You forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the cruelty of the enemy?

10. [As] with a sword in my bones, my enemies shame me; while they say daily to me, Where [is] your God?

11. Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why do you moan within me? Hope in God; for I still praise Him, the salvation of my face, and my God.

## Psalms 43

1. Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation. Oh deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.

2. For You [are] the God of my strength; why do You cast me off? Why do I go mourning under the affliction of the enemy?

3. Oh send out Your light and Your truth; let them lead me; let them bring me to Your holy hill, and to Your tabernacles.

4. Then I will go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy; yea, on the harp I will praise You, O God, my God.

5. Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why do you moan within me? Hope in God; for I still praise Him, the salvation of my face, and my God.

## Psalms 44

1. To the Chief Musician. For the sons of Korah, a contemplation. We have heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us the work which You did in their days, in the days of old.

2. You drove out the nations [with] Your hand, and planted them; You brought evil on peoples and cast them out.

3. For they did not get the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them; but [it was] Your right hand, and Your arm, and the light of Your face, because You favored them.

4. You [are] my king, O God; command victories for Jacob.

5. Through You we will push our enemies; through Your name we will trample those who rise up against us.

6. For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.

7. But You have saved us from our enemies, and have put them to shame, those who hated us.

8. In God we boast all the day long, and praise Your name forever. Selah.

9. Now You have cast us off, and have shamed us, and You do not go forth with our armies.

10. You make us turn back from the adversary; and our haters plunder for themselves.

11. You have given us like sheep [for] food, and have scattered us among the nations.

12. You have sold Your people for nothing, and You did not increase by their price.

13. You make us a curse to our neighbors, a scorn and a mockery to those who are round about us.

14. You make us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the people.

15. My shame [is] always before me, and the shame of my face has covered me:

16. because of the voice of the slanderer and the blasphemer; before the enemy and avenger.

17. All this has come on us; yet we have not forgotten You nor dealt falsely in Your covenant.

18. Our heart is not turned back, nor have our steps turned aside from Your way,

19. though You have crushed us in the place of jackals and covered us with the shadow of death.

20. If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god,

21. shall not God search this out? For He knows the secrets of the heart.

22. Yea, for Your sake we are put to death all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.

23. Awaken! Why do You sleep, O LORD? Arise! Do not cast [us] off forever.

24. Why do You hide Your face, [and] forget our affliction and distress?

25. For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly holds fast to the earth.

26. Arise [for] our help, and redeem us for the sake of Your mercy.

## Psalms 45

1. To the Chief Musician. Concerning the Lilies, for the sons of Korah, a contemplation; A Song of Loves. My heart is overflowing [with] a good matter; I speak of my works to the King; my tongue [is] the pen of a ready writer.

2. You are the fairest of the sons of men; grace is poured into Your lips; therefore God has blessed You forever.

3. Gird Your sword on [Your] thigh, O mighty one, [with] Your glory and Your majesty.

4. And ride prosperously [in] Your majesty, because of truth and meekness [and] righteousness; and Your right hand shall teach You fearful things.

5. Your arrows [are] sharp in the heart of the King's enemies; peoples fall under You.

6. Your throne, O God, [is] forever and ever; the staff of Your kingdom [is] a staff of righteousness.

7. You love righteousness, and hate wickedness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your fellows.

8. All Your garments [smell] of myrrh, and aloes [and] cassia, out of the ivory palaces, by which they have made You glad.

9. Kings' daughters [are] among Your precious ones; on Your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir.

10. Listen, O daughter, and look; and bow down your ear; and forget your own people and your father's house.

11. And cause the King greatly to desire your beauty, for He [is] your Lord, and you shall worship Him.

12. And the daughter of Tyre [shall be there] with a gift; even the rich among the peoples shall stroke your face.

13. The king's daughter [is] all glorious within; her clothing [is] trimmed with gold.

14. She shall be brought to the king in clothing of needlework; the virgins, her companions after her, shall be brought to You.

15. They shall be led with joy and gladness; they shall enter into the King's palace.

16. Your sons shall be in the place of your fathers; you will make them princes in all the land.

17. I will make Your name to be remembered in all generations; therefore the people shall praise You forever and ever.

## Psalms 46

1. To the Chief Musician. For the sons of Korah. A Song For the Virgins. God [is] our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.

2. Therefore we will not fear when the earth changes, and when mountains [are] slipping into the heart of the seas.

3. Let its waters roar and foam; let the mountains shake with the swelling of it. Selah.

4. [There is] a river, its channels gladden the city of God glad, the holy [place] of the tabernacles of the Most High.

5. God [is] in the midst of her; she shall not be moved; God shall help her at the turning of the morning.

6. The nations raged, the kingdoms were shaken; He uttered His voice, the earth melted.

7. The LORD of hosts [is] with us; the God of Jacob [is] our refuge. Selah.

8. Come, behold the works of the LORD, who makes ruins on the earth;

9. who makes wars to cease to the ends of the earth; He breaks the bow, and cuts the spear in two; He burns the chariots in the fire.

10. Be still, and know that I [am] God! I will be praised among the nations, I will be praised in the earth.

11. The LORD of hosts [is] with us; the God of Jacob [is] our refuge. Selah.

## Psalms 47

1. To the Chief Musician. A Psalm for the sons of Korah. Clap your hand, all you peoples; shout to God with the voice of triumph.

2. For the LORD Most High [is] awesome, a great king over all the earth.

3. He shall humble the peoples under us, and nations under our feet.

4. He shall choose our inheritance for us, the majesty of Jacob whom He loved. Selah.

5. God has gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.

6. Sing praise to God, sing praise; sing praise to our King, sing praise.

7. For God [is] King of all the earth; sing praises with understanding.

8. God reigns over the nations, God sits on the throne of His holiness.

9. The rulers of the peoples are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham; for the shields of the earth [are] God's; He is lifted up on high.

## Psalms 48

1. A Song and Psalm for the Sons of Korah. Great [is] the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of His holiness.

2. Beautiful on high, the joy of the whole earth, [is] mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.

3. God is known in her strongholds for a refuge.

4. For, lo, the kings were gathered; they passed by together.

5. They saw, so they marvelled; they were troubled, [and] hurried away.

6. Fear took hold on them there, [and] pain, like a woman in labor.

7. You break the ships of Tarshish with an east wind;

8. as we have heard, so we have seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God. God will establish it forever. Selah.

9. We have thought of Your loving-kindness, O God, in the midst of Your temple.

10. According to Your name, O God, so [is] Your praise to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is full of righteousness; let mount Zion rejoice!

11. Let the daughters of Judah shout for joy because of Your judgments!

12. Walk around Zion, and go all around it; count the towers of it,

13. Set your heart on its ramparts, pass between its strongholds; so that you may tell [it] to the coming generation.

14. For this God [is] our God forever and ever; He will be [our] guide [even] to death.

## Psalms 49

1. To the Chief Musician. A Psalm for the sons of Korah. Hear this, all you peoples; give ear, all inhabitants of the world;

2. both sons of mankind, and sons of man, rich and poor together;

3. my mouth shall speak of wise things; and the thoughts of my heart [shall be] of understanding.

4. I will bow down my ear to a parable; I will open my dark saying on the harp.

5. Why should I fear in the days of evil, [when] the perversity of my ambushers will surround me?

6. Those who trust in their wealth, and their many riches, boast themselves.

7. A man cannot at all redeem a brother, nor give to God a ransom for him,

8. for the redemption of their soul [is] precious, and it ceases forever,

9. yea, he shall yet live forever; he shall never see corruption.

10. For he sees wise men die; likewise the fool and the animal-like ones perish, and leave their wealth to others.

11. Their inward [thought is that] their houses shall [go on] forever, and their dwelling-places to all generations; they call [their] lands after their own names.

12. But man, though high in honor, does not remain; he is like the animals [that] perish.

13. This way of theirs [is] their foolishness; yet their followers delight in their sayings. Selah.

14. Like sheep they are appointed to the grave; death shall reign [for] them; and the upright shall have the rule over them in the morning; and their form [is] for rotting; the grave [is] their home.

15. But God will redeem my soul from the hand of the grave; for He will take me. Selah.

16. Be not afraid when one becomes rich, when the glory of his house increases;

17. for when he dies he shall take nothing away; his glory shall not go down after him.

18. For in his life he blessed his soul; yea, they praise you when you do well to yourself.

19. He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.

20. Man in honor, but without understanding, is like the animals; they shall perish.

## Psalms 50

1. A Psalm of Asaph. The mighty God, the LORD, has spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun to [its] going down.

2. Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shone.

3. Our God comes, and He is not silent; a fire shall devour before Him, and it shall be very stormy all around Him.

4. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, so that He may judge His people.

5. Gather My saints to Me; and those who cut My covenant by sacrifice.

6. And the heavens shall declare His righteousness; for God Himself [is] judge. Selah.

7. Hear, My people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will testify against you; I [am] God, your God.

8. I will not reprove you for your sacrifices; yea, your burnt offerings [are] continually before Me.

9. I will take no bull out of your house, [nor] he-goats out of your folds.

10. For every beast of the forest [is] Mine, [and] the cattle on a thousand hills.

11. I know all the birds of the mountains; and the wild beasts of the field [are] Mine.

12. If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world [is] Mine, and the fullness of it.

13. Will I eat the flesh of the mighty, or drink the blood of goats?

14. Offer to God thanksgiving; and pay your vows to the Most High;

15. and call on Me in the day of trouble; and I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me.

16. But to the wicked, God says, What [is it] to you, to declare My statutes, and to take up My covenant in your mouth?

17. Yea, you hate to be taught, and you toss My words behind you.

18. When you saw a thief, then you were pleased to be with him, and you [have taken] part with adulterers.

19. You give your mouth to evil, and your tongue frames deceit.

20. You sit; you speak against your brother; you slander your own mother's son.

21. These [things] you have done, and I have kept silence; you thought [that] I was like yourself, [but] I will rebuke you, and set in order before your eyes.

22. Now think of this, you who forget God, lest I tear [you] in pieces, and there be none to deliver.

23. Whoever offers praise glorifies Me; and he who sets a way, I will show him the salvation of God.

## Psalms 51

1. To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba. Have mercy on me, O God, according to Your loving-kindness; according to the multitude of Your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions.

2. Wash me completely from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.

3. For I confess my transgressions; and my sin [is] ever before me.

4. Against You, You only, have I sinned, and done evil in Your sight; that You might be justified when You speak, [and] be clear when You judge.

5. Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.

6. Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts; and in the hidden [part] You shall make me to know wisdom.

7. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

8. Make me to hear joy and gladness; [that] the bones [which] You have broken may rejoice.

9. Hide Your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.

10. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.

11. Cast me not away from Your presence, and take not Your Holy Spirit from me.

12. Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and uphold me [with] a willing spirit.

13. [Then] I will teach transgressors Your ways; and sinners shall be converted to You.

14. Deliver me from the guilt of shedding blood, O God, O God of my salvation, [and] my tongue shall sing aloud of Your righteousness.

15. O LORD, open my lips, and my mouth shall show forth Your praise.

16. For You do not desire sacrifice; or else I would give [it]; You do not delight in burnt offering.

17. The sacrifices of God [are] a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.

18. Do good in Your good pleasure to Zion; build the walls of Jerusalem.

19. Then shall You be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering; then they shall offer bulls on Your altar.

## Psalms 52

1. To the Chief Musician. A contemplation. A Psalm of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said to him, David has come to the house of Ahimelech. Why do you boast yourself in evil, O mighty man? The mercy of God [endures forever.

2. Your tongue devises evil, like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.

3. You love evil more than good, [and] lying more than to speak righteousness. Selah.

4. You love all devouring words, O deceitful tongue.

5. God will likewise destroy you forever; He shall take you away, and pluck you out of [your] tent, and root you out of the land of the living. Selah.

6. And the righteous shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him, [saying] ,

7. Behold, the man [who] did not make God his strength, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, he was strong in his wickedness.

8. But I [am] like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever.

9. I will praise You forever, because You have done [it]; and I will wait [on] Your name; for [it is] good before Your saints.

## Psalms 53

1. To the Chief Musician on Mahalath. A contemplation. A Psalm of David. The fool has said in his heart, [There is] no God. They acted corruptly, and have worked out abominable wickedness; [there is] not one doing good.

2. God looked down from Heaven on the sons of mankind to see if [any] was discerning, who was seeking God.

3. Every one has turned away; they have altogether become filthy; not one is doing good, no, not even one.

4. Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? They eat up my people [as] they eat bread; they have not called on God.

5. There they dreaded [with] dread, [where] no dread was; for God has scattered the bones of him who camps against you; you have put [them] to shame because God rejects them.

6. Who will give from Zion the salvation of Israel? When God brings back the captivity of His people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

## Psalms 54

1. To the Chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A contemplation. A Psalm of David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Does not David hide himself among us? Save me, O God, by Your name, and judge me by Your strength.

2. Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.

3. For strangers have risen up against me, and cruel men seek after my soul; they have not set God before them. Selah.

4. Behold, God [is] my helper; the LORD [is] with those who uphold my soul.

5. He shall reward evil to my enemies; cut them off in Your truth.

6. I will freely sacrifice to You; I will praise Your name, O LORD, for [it is] good.

7. For He has delivered me out of all trouble; and my eye has seen [its desire] on my enemies.

## Psalms 55

1. To the Chief Musician. For stringed instruments. A contemplation. A Psalm of David. Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not Yourself from my cry.

2. Attend to me, and hear me; I wander and I moan in my complaint,

3. from the voice of the enemy, from the oppression of the wicked, for they shake trouble over me, and in wrath they hate me.

4. My heart is pained within me; and the terrors of death have fallen on me.

5. Fear and trembling have come on me, and horror has covered me.

6. And I said, Who will give to me wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest.

7. Lo, I would wander far off; I would lodge in the desert. Selah.

8. I would hasten my escape from the windy storm [and] tempest.

9. Swallow up, O LORD, [and] divide their tongues; for I have seen violence and fighting in the city.

10. They go around her on her walls by day and night; and evil and sorrow [are] in her midst.

11. Covetings [are] in her midst; oppression and guile will not depart from her streets.

12. For [it is] not an enemy [who] reviled me; then I could have borne [it]; [it is] not one who hates me [who] magnified [himself] against me; or I would hide myself from him;

13. but [it is] you, a man my rank, my guide and my friend.

14. We took sweet counsel together, [and] walked to the house of God in company.

15. Let desolation take hold on them, [and] let them go down alive [into] hell; for evils [are] among them in their dwellings.

16. I, [even] I, will call to God, and the LORD will save me.

17. Evening and morning, and at noon, I will pray and cry aloud; and He shall hear my voice.

18. He has delivered my soul in peace from the battle [that was] against me; for there were many with me.

19. God shall hear and answer them, even He who is enthroned of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they do not fear God.

20. He has put forth his hands against those who were at peace with him; he has broken his covenant.

21. The butterings of his mouth [were] forked, but war [was] in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they [were] drawn swords.

22. Cast your burden on the LORD, and He will keep you; He will never allow the righteous to waver.

23. But You, O God, will bring them down into the pit of ruin; bloody and deceitful men shall not [live] half their days; but I will trust in You.

## Psalms 56

1. To the Chief Musician. Concerning the silent dove-- those far off. Of David, a secret treasure--when the Philistines took him in Gath. Be merciful to me, O God, for man would swallow me up; fighting daily, he presses me down.

2. My watchers panted for me daily; for many [are] they who proudly fight against me.

3. When I am afraid I will trust in You.

4. In God I will praise His word; in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do to me.

5. All day long they pervert my words; all their thoughts [are] against me for evil.

6. They stir up strife; they hide themselves; they watch my steps as they wait for my soul.

7. Let them melt away like waters; they run off to them; he bends his arrows, [let them be] as though [they were] cut off.

8. [Let them be] as a snail goes [into] melting; [as] a miscarriage of a woman, they do not see the sun.

12. [For] the sin of their mouth [is] the word of their lips, even let them be taken in their pride; and for cursing and the lying [which] they speak.

13. Consume [them] in wrath; consume, so that they may not be; and let them know that God rules in Jacob to the ends of the earth. Selah.

3. I am weary from my crying; my throat is dried; my eyes fail while I wait for my God.

5. O God, You know my foolishness, and my guiltiness [is] not hidden from You.

6. Do not let those who wait on You, O LORD God of hosts, be ashamed for my sake; let not the ones who seek You be ashamed for my sake, O God of Israel,

7. because I have borne reproach for Your sake, shame has covered my face.

14. Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink; let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters.

15. Do not let the flood of waters overflow me, nor let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut its mouth on me.

16. Hear me, O LORD, for Your loving-kindness [is] good; turn to me according to the multitude of Your tender mercies.

17. And hide not Your face from Your servant; for I am in trouble; hear me quickly.

18. Draw near my soul, and redeem it; deliver me because of my enemies.

19. You have known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor; my enemies [are] all before You.

20. Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness; and I looked [for some] to mourn with me, but [there was] none; and for comforters, but I found none.

21. They also gave Me gall for my food; and in My thirst they gave Me vinegar to drink.

22. Let their table become a snare before them; and to those at ease a trap.

23. Let their eyes be darkened, so that they do not see; and make their loins shake without ceasing.

24. Pour out Your wrath on them, and let the glow of Your anger take hold of them.

25. Let their dwelling be wasted; let none dwell in their tents.

10. For my enemies speak against me; and those who watch for my soul plot together,

11. saying, God has forsaken him; pursue and take him, for [there is] none to deliver [him].

12. O God, be not far from me; O my God, make haste for my help.

13. Let them be ashamed; let those who are enemies of my soul be consumed; let them be covered [with] reproach and dishonor, those who seek my hurt.

14. But I will hope without ceasing, and I will add more in all Your praise.

15. My mouth shall show forth Your righteousness [and] Your salvation all the day; for I do not know how many they are.

16. I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD; I will speak of Your righteousness, of Yours alone.

17. O God, You have taught me from my youth; and before now I have declared Your wonderful works.

18. And now when I am old and gray-headed, O God, do not leave me; until I have declared Your strength to [this] generation, and Your power to everyone who is to come.

19. And Your righteousness, O God, [is] very high, who have done great things. O God, who [is] like You,

20. who has shown me great and evil distresses; You will turn [me]; You will make me live. You will turn me from the depths of the earth, You will bring me up.

21. You will increase my greatness and surround [and] comfort me on every side.

22. I will also praise You with a harp. O my God, I will sing Your truth; to You I will sing with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.

23. My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing to You, and my soul, which You have redeemed.

24. My tongue also shall muse on Your righteousness all the day long; for those who seek my evil have turned pale, they are brought to shame.

5. They [are] not in trouble [like other] men; neither are they plagued like other men.

6. Therefore pride enchains them; violence covers them [like] a robe.

12. Behold, these [are] the ungodly, who are at ease in the world; they increase [in] riches.

13. Surely I have made my heart pure [in] vain, and washed my hands in innocence.

14. For all the day long I have been plagued, and chastened every morning.

15. If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I would deceive a generation of Your sons.

16. When I thought deeply in order to understand this, it [was] painful for me,

17. until I went into the sanctuary of God; [then] I understood their end.

18. Surely You set them in slippery places; You cast them down into ruin.

19. How have they been [brought] into grief, as in a moment! They are fully eaten up with terrors,

20. like a dream when [one] awakens; so, O LORD, when You awake, You shall despise their image.

21. For my heart was grieved and I was pricked [in] my reins.

22. So foolish [was] I, and I did not know; I was [like] a beast before You.

23. But I [am] always with You; You have held [me] by my right hand.

24. You shall lead me with Your counsel, and afterward receive me [to] glory.

25. Whom have I in Heaven? And besides You I desire none on earth.

26. My flesh and my heart fail; [but] God [is] the strength of my heart, and my part forever.

27. For lo, those who are far from You shall perish; You have destroyed all who go lusting away from You.

28. And I, [it is] good for me to draw near to God; I have put my trust in the LORD God, to declare all Your works.

## Psalms 74

1. An Instruction of Asaph. O God, have You cast [us] off forever? Will Your anger smoke against the sheep of Your pasture?

2. Remember Your congregation, [which] You have purchased of old, the rod of Your inheritance which You have redeemed; this mount Zion in [which] You have dwelt.

3. Lift up Your feet to the never-ending ruins, even all that the enemy has done wickedly in the sanctuary.

4. Your enemies roar in the midst of Your congregation; they set up their own banners [for] signs.

5. He is known as one bringing axes on high, on the thick trees.

6. And now all its carvings too, they break down with axes and hammers.

7. They have cast fire into Your sanctuary; they have defiled the dwelling-place of Your name to the ground.

8. They said in their hearts, Together let us rage against them; they have burned up all God's meeting-places in the land.

9. We did not see our signs; [there is] no prophet any more; neither [is there] among us any who knows how long.

10. O God, how long shall the enemy speak evil? Shall the enemy blaspheme Your name forever?

11. Why do You withdraw Your hand, even Your right hand? Draw [it] out of Your bosom.

12. For God [is] my king of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth,

13. You divide the sea by Your strength; You break the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.

14. You cracked open the heads of leviathan, and gave him to [be food] to the people living in the wilderness.

15. You divide the fountain and the flood; You dry up mighty rivers.

16. The day [is] Yours, the night also [is] Yours; You have prepared the light and the sun.

17. You have set all the borders of the earth; You have made summer and winter.

18. Remember this, the enemy has cursed, O LORD, and the foolish people have blasphemed Your name.

19. Do not deliver the soul of Your turtle dove to the multitude; forget not the congregation of Your poor forever.

20. Look to the covenant; for the dark places of the earth are full of the houses of evil.

21. Oh let not the ill-treated ones return ashamed; let the poor and needy praise Your name.

22. Arise, O God, plead Your own cause; remember how the foolish man curses You daily.

23. Forget not the voice of Your enemies; the noise of those who rise up against You keeps on increasing.

## Psalms 75

1. To the Chief Musician. Do not destroy. A Psalm of Asaph. A Song. To You, O God, we have given thanks, to You we have given thanks; for Your name is near, Your wonderful works declared.

2. When I take the appointed time, I will judge uprightly.

3. The earth and all its people are melting away; I hold up its pillars. Selah.

4. I said to the proud, Do not boast; and to the wicked, Do not lift up the horn;

5. do not lift up your horn on high; [nor] speak [with] a stiff neck.

6. For lifting up [comes] neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.

7. But God [is] the judge; [He] puts down one and sets up another.

8. For in the hand of the LORD [there is] a cup, and the wine is red; it is fully mixed; and He pours out from it; but the dregs of it, all the wicked of the earth shall drain its dregs [and] drink.

9. But I will declare forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.

10. Also I will cut off all the horns of the wicked; [but] the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.

## Psalms 76

1. To the Chief Musician. For stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph. A Song. God [is] known in Judah, His name is great in Israel.

2. And His abode is in Salem; and His dwelling-place in Zion.

3. There He broke the fiery arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.

4. You [are] more glorious [and] excellent than the mountains of prey.

5. The stouthearted have been stripped; they slept their sleep; and none of the men of might have found their hands.

6. By Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the horse and the chariot have sunk into a sleep.

7. You, [even] You, [are] terrifying, and who can stand when once You are angry?

8. You cause judgment to be heard from Heaven; the earth feared and was still,

9. when God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.

10. Surely the wrath of man shall praise You; the wrath that is left, You shall bind up.

11. Vow, and pay to the LORD your God; let all that are around Him bring presents to the Fearful One.

12. He shall cut off the spirit in princes; [He is] feared by the kings of the earth.

## Psalms 77

1. To the Chief Musician. To Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph. I cried to God with my voice, to God [is] my voice; and He gave ear to me.

2. In the day of my trouble I sought the LORD; my hand was poured in the night, and ceased not; my soul refused to be comforted.

3. I remembered God, and was troubled; I complained, and my spirit fainted. Selah.

4. You keep my eyes awake; I am troubled and I cannot speak.

5. I have thought on the days of old, the years of ages [past].

6. I remember my song in the night; I speak with my own heart, and my spirit carefully searches.

7. Will the Lord cast off forever? And will He be favorable no more?

8. Is His mercy gone forever? Has [His] word failed for all generations?

9. Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has He in anger shut up His tender mercies? Selah.

10. And I said, This [is] my weakness, the years of the right hand of the Most High.

11. I will remember the works of the LORD; surely I will remember Your wonders of old.

12. I will also think on all Your work, and talk of Your doings.

13. Your way, O God, [is] in holiness; who [is] so great a God as our God?

14. You [are] the God who does wonders; You have declared Your strength among the people.

15. You have with [Your] arm redeemed Your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.

16. The waters saw You, O God, the waters saw You; they were afraid; the depths also were troubled.

17. The clouds poured out water; the skies sent out a sound; Your arrows also flew here and there.

18. The voice of Your thunder [was] in the sky; the lightnings lit up the world; the earth trembled and shook.

19. Your way [is] in the sea, and Your path in the great waters, and Your footsteps are not known.

20. You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

## Psalms 78

1. An instruction of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, [to] my law; bow down your ears to the words of my mouth.

2. I will open my mouth in a parable; I will speak dark sayings of old,

3. which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.

4. We will not hide [them] from their sons, showing to the generations to come the praises of the LORD, and His strength, and His wonderful works that He has done.

5. For He set up a testimony in Jacob, and ordered a law in Israel, which He commanded our fathers, that they should teach them to their sons;

6. so that the generation to come might know; sons shall be born, and they shall arise [and] tell their sons,

7. so that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep His commandments;

8. and might not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation [that] did not set their heart aright, and whose spirit was not faithful with God.

9. The sons of Ephraim, armed shooters of bows, turned back in the day of battle.

10. They did not keep the covenant of God, and refused to walk in His law.

11. And they forgot His works and His wonders which He had shown them.

12. He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, [in] the field of Zoan.

13. He divided the sea and caused them to pass through; and He made the waters to stand in a heap.

14. And in the daytime He led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.

15. He split the rocks in the wilderness, and let [them] drink, as [from] the great depths.

16. He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.

17. And they sinned still more against Him, by provoking the Most High in the wilderness.

18. And they tempted God in their heart by asking food for their lust.

19. And they spoke against God; they said, Can God set a table in the wilderness?

20. Behold! He struck the rock so that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed. Can He also give bread? Can He provide flesh for His people?

21. Therefore the LORD heard, and was made furious; so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel,

22. because they did not believe in God, and did not trust in His salvation;

23. though He had commanded the clouds from above, and had opened the doors of the heavens;

24. and had rained down manna on them to eat, and He gave them of the grain of the heavens.

25. Man ate the food of the mighty; He sent them meat to the full.

26. He caused an east [wind] to blow in the sky; and by His power He brought in the south [wind].

27. and He also rained flesh on them like dust, and winged birds like the sand of the sea;

28. and He let [them] fall in the middle of their camp, all around their tents.

29. So they ate, and were filled to the full; for He gave them their own desire.

30. They were not turned away from their lust, but while their food [was] still in their mouths,

31. the wrath of God came on them and killed the fattest of them, and struck down the chosen of Israel.

32. For all this they still sinned, and did not believe because of His wonderful works.

33. Therefore He ended their days in vanity and their years in trouble.

34. When He killed them, then they looked for Him; and they turned back and sought after God.

35. And they remembered that God [was] their rock, and the Most High God was their redeemer.

36. But they flattered Him with their mouths, and they lied to Him with their tongues.

37. For their heart was not right with Him, neither were they faithful in His covenant.

38. But He, full of pity, forgave their iniquity, and did not destroy [them]; yea, many times He turned His anger away, and did not stir up all His wrath.

39. For He remembered that they [were but] flesh, a wind that passes away and does not come again.

40. How often they provoked Him in the wilderness, and grieved Him in the desert!

41. Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and pained to the Holy One of Israel.

42. They did not remember His hand, the day when He delivered them from the enemy;

43. how He had set His signs in Egypt, and His wonders in the fields of Zoan.

44. He turned their rivers into blood, and their floods, [so that] they could not drink.

45. He sent different kinds of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.

46. He also gave their crops to the stripping locust, and their labor to the locust.

47. He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with sleet.

48. He gave up their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to bolts of fire.

49. He sent on them the heat of His anger, wrath and fury and trouble, by sending evil angels.

50. He made a way to His anger; He did not save their soul from death, but gave their life over to the plague,

51. and struck all the first-born in Egypt, the first of the strong in the tents of Ham;

52. and led His people forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.

53. And He led them on safely, so that they did not fear; but the sea flooded over their enemies.

54. And He brought them within His own holy border, this mountain, [which] His right hand had bought.

55. He also cast out the nations before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.

56. Yet they tempted and provoked the Most High God, and kept not His testimonies;

57. but they turned back, and acted unfaithfully like their fathers; they were turned aside like a deceiving bow.

58. For they provoked Him to anger with their high places, and moved Him to jealousy with their carved images.

59. When God heard, He was angry, and turned away from Israel;

60. so that He left the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent [which] He placed among men,

61. and delivered His strength into captivity, and His glory into the enemy's hands.

62. He also gave His people over to the sword, and was angry with His inheritance.

63. The fire burned up their young men; and their maidens were not given in marriage.

64. Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows were not able to weep.

65. Then the Lord awakened like one out of sleep, like a mighty man rejoicing with wine.

66. And He drove His enemies backward; He put them to a never-ending shame.

67. And He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;

68. but chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which He loved.

69. And He built His holy place like high [palaces], like the earth which He has founded forever.

70. He also chose David His servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;

71. from following the ewes great with young He brought him to feed Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance.

72. And he fed them according to the pureness of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

## Psalms 79

1. A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the nations have come into Your inheritance; they have defiled Your holy temple; they have laid Jerusalem in heaps.

2. They have given the dead bodies of Your servants [as] food for the birds of the heavens, the flesh of Your saints to the beasts of the earth.

3. They have shed their blood like water round about Jerusalem, and none to bury.

4. We have become a shame to our neighbors, a scorn and mockery to those who are around us.

5. How long, O LORD? Will You be angry forever? Shall Your jealousy burn like fire?

6. Pour out Your wrath on the nations who have not known You, and on the kingdoms who have not called on Your name.

7. For [they have] eaten up Jacob, and wasted his dwelling-place.

8. O do not remember against us our former sins; let Your tender mercies meet us quickly; for we are brought very low.

9. Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Your name; and deliver us, and atone for our sins, for Your name's sake.

10. Why should the nations say, Where [is] their God? Let Him be known among the nations before our eyes [by] the revenging of the blood of Your servants [which is] shed.

11. Let the groaning of the prisoner come before You; according to the greatness of Your power, leave a remnant of those who are to die,

12. and give to our neighbors their curse sevenfold into their bosom, the curse with which they have cursed You, O Lord.

13. Then we, Your people and sheep of Your pasture, will give You thanks forever; we will show forth Your praise to all generations.

## Psalms 80

1. To the Chief Musician. A Testimony Concerning the Lilies. A Psalm of Asaph. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, You who lead Joseph like a flock; You dwelling between the cherubs, shine forth.

2. Stir up Your strength before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, and come, save us.

3. Turn us again, O God, and cause Your face to shine, and we shall be saved!

4. O LORD God of hosts, how long will You be angry against the prayer of Your people?

5. You feed them with the bread of tears; and give them tears to drink in great measure.

6. You make us a strife for our neighbors; and our enemies laugh among themselves.

7. Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause Your face to shine; and we shall be saved.

8. You have brought a vine out of Egypt; You have cast out the nations and planted it.

9. You cleared before it, and caused it to take deep root; and it filled the land.

10. The hills were covered [with] its shadow, and its boughs [were as] the great cedars.

11. It sent out its boughs to the sea, and its branches to the river.

12. Why have You broken down its hedges, so that all those who pass by the way pluck it?

13. The boar out of the wood wastes it, and the wild beast of the field eats it.

14. Return, we beg You, O God of hosts; look down from Heaven, and behold, and visit this vine,

15. and the vineyard which Your right hand has planted, and the Son [that] You make strong for Yourself.

16. [It is] burned with fire, and cut down; they perish at the rebuke of Your holy face.

17. Let Your hand be on the Man of Your right hand, on the Son of man [whom] You have made strong for Yourself.

18. So we will not go back from You; make us live, and we will call on Your name.

19. Turn us again, O LORD God of Hosts; cause Your face to shine, and we shall be saved.

## Psalms 81

1. To the Chief Musician. On Gittith, A Psalm of Asaph. Sing aloud to God our strength; shout for joy to the God of Jacob.

2. Lift up a psalm, and bring the timbrel here, the pleasing lyre and harp.

3. Blow the ram's horn in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.

4. For this [was] a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.

5. This He ordained in Joseph [for] a testimony, when He went out over the land of Egypt; I heard a language I understood not.

6. I removed his shoulder from the burden; his hands were delivered from the pots.

7. You called in trouble, and I delivered you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah.

8. Hear, O My people, and I will testify to you; O Israel, if you will listen to Me,

9. there shall be no strange god in you; nor shall you worship any strange god.

10. I [am] the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt; open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.

11. But My people would not listen to My voice, and Israel would have none of Me.

12. So I gave them up to the stubbornness of their own hearts; [and] they walked in their own conceits.

13. Oh that My people had listened to Me, [and] Israel had walked in My ways!

14. I would soon have humbled their enemies, and would have turned My hand against their foes.

15. The haters of the LORD would have been found liars to Him, and their time would have lasted forever.

16. And He would have fed them also with the finest of the wheat; and [with] honey out of the rock I would have satisfied you.

## Psalms 82

1. A Psalm of Asaph. God stands in the congregation of God; in the midst of the gods He judges.

2. How long will you judge unjustly and lift up the faces of the wicked? Selah.

3. Defend the poor and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and needy.

4. Deliver the poor and needy; save [them] out of the hand of the wicked.

5. They neither know nor will understand; they walk on in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.

6. I have said, You [are] gods; and all of you sons of the Most High.

7. But you shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.

8. Arise, O God, judge the earth; for You shall inherit in all nations.

## Psalms 83

1. A Song. A Psalm of Asaph. Keep not silence, O God; do not be speechless, and be not still, O God.

2. For lo, Your enemies roar; and those who hate You have lifted up their head.

3. They take shrewd counsel against Your people, and plot against Your hidden ones.

4. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from [being] a nation, so that the name Israel may be remembered no more.

5. For with one heart they have plotted together; they have made a covenant against You--

6. the tents of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarites;

7. Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the people of Tyre;

8. and Assyria has joined with them; they have helped the sons of Lot. Selah.

9. Do to them as [to] Midian, as [to] Sisera, as [to] Jabin at the torrent Kishon;

10. who perished at Endor; they became [as] dung for the earth.

11. Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb; yea, all their princes like Zebah, and like Zalmunna;

12. who said, Let us take possession for ourselves of the houses of God.

13. O my God, make them like a wheel; like the stubble before the wind.

14. As the fire burns a forest, and as the flame sets the mountains on fire,

15. so pursue them with Your tempest, and make them afraid with Your storm.

16. Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek Your name, O LORD.

17. Let them be ashamed and troubled forever; yea, let them be put to shame, and lost;

18. so that [men] may know that Your name is JEHOVAH, that You alone [are] the Most High over all the earth.

## Psalms 84

1. To the Chief Musician. On Gittith. A Psalm for the sons of Korah. How lovely [are] Your tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!

2. My soul longs, yea, even faints for the courts of the LORD; my heart and my flesh shout for joy to the living God.

3. Even the sparrow has found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young, Your altars, O LORD of hosts, my king and my God.

4. Blessed [are] they who dwell in Your house; they will still praise You. Selah.

5. Blessed [is] the man [whose] strength [is] in You; [Your] ways [are] in their hearts.

6. Passing through the valley of weeping, they will make it a fountain; the early rain also covers [it with] blessings.

7. They go from strength to strength, appearing in Zion before God.

8. O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.

9. Behold, O God, our shield, and look on the face of Your anointed.

10. For a day in Your courts [is] better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than dwell in the tents of wickedness.

11. For the LORD God [is] a sun and shield; the LORD will give grace and glory; no good [thing] will He withhold from those who walk uprightly.

12. O LORD of hosts, blessed [is] the man who trusts in You.

## Psalms 85

1. To the Chief Musician. A Psalm for the sons of Korah. O LORD, You have been gracious to Your land; You have brought back the captivity of Jacob.

2. You have forgiven the iniquity of Your people; You have covered all their sins. Selah.

3. You have taken away all Your wrath; You have turned from the heat of Your anger.

4. Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause Your anger toward us to cease.

5. Will You be angry with us forever? Will You draw out Your anger to all generations?

6. Will You not give us life again, so that Your people may rejoice in You?

7. Show us Your mercy, O LORD, and grant us Your salvation.

8. I will hear what God the LORD will speak; for He will speak peace to His people, and to His saints; but let them not turn again to folly.

9. Surely His salvation [is] near those that fear Him, so that glory may dwell in our land.

10. Mercy and truth have met together; righteousness and peace have kissed [each other].

11. Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from Heaven.

12. Yea, the LORD shall give good; and our land shall yield its increase.

13. Righteousness shall go before Him and shall set [us] in the way of His steps.

## Psalms 86

1. A Prayer of David. Bow down Your ear, O LORD, hear me; for I [am] poor and needy.

2. Preserve my soul; for I [am] holy; O You my God, save Your servant who trusts in You.

3. Be merciful to me, O Lord; for I cry to You daily.

4. Give joy to the soul of Your servant; for to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul.

5. For You, Lord, [are] good and ready to forgive, and rich in mercy to all those who call on You.

6. Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer; and attend to the voice of my prayers.

7. In the day of my trouble I will call on You; for You will answer me.

8. Among the gods [there is] none like You, O Lord; none [are] like Your works.

9. All nations whom You have made shall come and worship before You, O Lord, and shall glorify Your name.

10. For You [are] great and do wonderful things; You alone [are] God.

11. Teach me Your way, O LORD; I will walk in Your truth; my heart rejoices to fear Your name.

12. I will praise You, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify Your name forevermore.

13. For great [is] Your mercy toward me; and You have delivered my soul from the lowest hell.

14. O God, the proud have risen against me, and the company of violent [men] have sought after my life, and have not set You before them.

15. But You, O God, [are] God full of pity, and gracious, long-suffering, and rich in mercy and truth.

16. Oh turn to me, and have mercy on me; give Your strength to Your servant, and save the son of Your handmaid.

17. Show me a token for good, so that they who hate me may see and be ashamed; because You, LORD, have helped me and comforted me.

## Psalms 87

1. A Psalm for the sons of Korah, A Song. His foundation [is] in the holy mountains.

2. The LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.

3. Glorious things [are] spoken of you, O city of God. Selah.

4. I will mention Rahab and Babylon to those who know me; behold, Philistia and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this [man] was born there.

5. And to Zion it shall be said, [This] man and [that] man was born in her; and the Highest shall establish her.

6. The LORD shall count, in recording the peoples, [that] this [man] was born there. Selah.

7. And the singers, the players of the pipe: all my springs [are] in You!

## Psalms 88

1. A Song. A Psalm for the sons of Korah. To the Chief Musician. On Mahalath, to make humble. A Poem of Heman the Ezrahite. O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before You.

2. Let my prayer come before You; bow down Your ear to my cry.

3. For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near the grave.

4. I am counted with those who go down to the Pit; I am like a feeble man;

5. free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom You remember no more; and by Your hand they are cut off.

6. You have laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.

7. Your wrath lies hard on me, and You have afflicted [me] with all Your waves. Selah.

8. You have taken my friends away from me; You have made me a hateful thing to them. [I am] shut up, and I cannot go out.

9. My eye mourns because of affliction; O LORD, I have called daily on You; I have stretched out my hands to You.

10. For will You do wonders to the dead? Shall the dead rise [and] praise You? Selah.

11. Shall Your loving-kindness be declared in the grave? [Or] Your faithfulness in ruin?

12. Shall Your wonders be known in the dark, and Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

13. But to You I have cried, O LORD; and in the morning my prayer shall go before You.

14. O LORD, why do You cast off my soul? [Why] do You hide Your face from me?

15. I [am] afflicted and ready to die from my youth up; while I suffer Your terrors, I pine away.

16. Your fierce wrath goes over me; Your terrors have cut me off.

17. They surrounded me like waters all the day long; they have come together around me.

18. You have taken lover and friend far from me, [and] those who know me into darkness.

## Psalms 89

1. A Poem of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will sing of the mercies of the LORD forever; with my mouth I will make known Your faithfulness to all generations.

2. For I have said, Mercy shall be built up forever; You shall establish Your faithfulness in the heavens.

3. I have cut a covenant with My chosen; I have sworn to David My servant,

4. Your seed will I establish forever, and build up your throne to all generations. Selah.

5. And the heavens shall praise Your wonders, O LORD, Your faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.

6. For who in the sky can be ranked [with] the LORD? Who among the mighty is like the LORD?

7. God is greatly to be feared in the congregation of the saints, and to be adored by all around Him.

8. O LORD God of hosts, who [is] a strong LORD like You? And Your faithfulness is round about You?

9. You rule the raging of the sea; when its waves arise, You still them.

10. You have broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; You have scattered Your enemies with Your strong arm.

11. The heavens [are] Yours, the earth also [is] Yours; You have founded the world and its fullness.

12. The north and the south, You have created them; Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in Your name.

13. You have a mighty arm; Your hand is strong, [and] Your right hand is high.

14. Justice and judgment [are] the foundation of Your throne; mercy and truth shall go before Your face.

15. Blessed [is] the people that knows the joyful sound; they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of Your face.

16. In Your name they shall rejoice all the day; and in Your righteousness they shall be lifted up.

17. For You [are] the glory of their strength; and in Your favor our horn shall be lifted up.

18. For the LORD [is] our shield; yea, our king [is] the Holy One of Israel.

19. Then You spoke in a vision to Your holy one, and You said, I have laid help on a mighty one; I have lifted up a chosen one out of the people.

20. I have found David, My servant; with My holy oil I have anointed him.

21. My hand shall be always with him; My arm also shall make him strong.

22. The enemy shall not use force on him, nor the son of wickedness afflict him.

23. And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague those who hate him.

24. But My faithfulness and My mercy [shall be] with him; and in My name his horn [shall be] lifted up.

25. I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.

26. He shall cry to Me, My Father, You [are] my God, and the rock of my salvation.

27. And I will make him [My] first-born, higher than the kings of the earth.

28. I will keep My mercy for him forever, and My covenant shall stand fast with him.

29. Also I have set his seed forever, and his throne as the days of the heavens.

30. If his children forsake My law, and do not walk in My judgments;

31. if they profane My statutes, and do not keep My commandments;

32. then I will visit their wickedness with the rod, and their sin with stripes.

33. But I will not completely take My loving-kindness from him, and I will not be false in My faithfulness.

34. I will not break My covenant, nor change the thing that has gone out of My lips.

35. Once I have sworn by My holiness that I will not lie to David.

36. His seed shall endure forever, and his throne as the sun before Me.

37. It shall be established forever like the moon, and [like] a faithful witness in the heavens. Selah.

38. But You have cast off and rejected [us]; You have been angry with Your anointed.

39. You have turned away from the covenant of Your servant; You have defiled his crown to the ground.

40. You have broken down all his hedges; You have brought his strongholds to ruin.

41. All who pass by the way plunder him; he is a curse to his neighbors.

42. You have set up the right hand of his enemies; You have made all [his] enemies rejoice.

43. You also have turned back the edge of his sword and have not made him stand in the battle.

44. You have made his glory to cease, and have thrown his throne down to the ground.

45. The days of his youth You have shortened; You have covered him [with] shame. Selah.

46. How long, LORD? Will You hide Yourself forever? Shall Your wrath burn like fire?

47. Remember, I pray, how short my time is; why have You made all men in vain?

48. What man lives and never sees death? Shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.

49. O Lord, where [are] Your former loving-kindnesses [which] You swore to David in Your truth?

50. Remember, Lord, the scorn of Your servants; [how] I bear in my bosom the insult of all the mighty people,

51. [with] which Your enemies have cursed, O LORD; [with] which they have cursed the footsteps of Your anointed.

52. Blessed [is] the LORD forevermore. Amen and Amen.

## Psalms 90

1. A Prayer of Moses, the man of God. O LORD, You have been our dwelling-place in all generations.

2. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting You [are] God.

3. You turn man to dust, and say, Return, sons of men.

4. For a thousand years in Your sight [are] as yesterday when it is past, and [as] a watch in the night.

5. You carry them away as with a flood; they are [as] a sleep; in the morning [they are] like grass which grows up.

6. In the morning it sprouts and shoots up; in the evening it is cut down, and dries up.

7. For we are burned up by Your anger, and by Your wrath we are troubled.

8. You have set our iniquities before You, our secret [sins] in the light of Your face.

9. For all our days pass away in Your wrath; we finish our years like a murmur.

10. The days of our years [are] threescore years and ten; and if by strength they [are] fourscore years, yet their pride [is] labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.

11. Who knows the power of Your anger? And as Your fear [is, so is] Your wrath.

12. So teach us to number our days, so that we may bring a heart of wisdom.

13. Return, O LORD! How long? And give pity to Your servants.

14. Satisfy us early with Your mercy, so that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.

15. Make us glad according to the days of our affliction, the years [in which] we have seen evil.

16. Let Your work appear to Your servants, and Your glory to their sons.

17. And let the beauty of the LORD our God be on us; and establish the work of our hands on us; yea, the work of our hands, establish it.

## Psalms 91

1. He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall rest [under] the shadow of the Almighty.

2. I will say of the LORD, my refuge and my fortress; my God; in Him I will trust.

3. Surely He will deliver you from the fowler's trap [and] from the destroying plague.

4. He shall cover you with His feathers, and under His wings you shall trust. His truth [shall be your] shield, and buckler.

5. You shall not fear the terror by night; nor because of the arrow [that] flies by day;

6. [nor] for the plague [that] walks in darkness, of the destruction laying waste at noonday.

7. A thousand shall fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; it shall not come near you.

8. Only with your eyes you shall look and see the reward of the wicked.

9. Because You, O LORD, [are] My refuge; [if] you have made the Most High Your dwelling-place,

10. no evil shall befall You, nor shall any plague come near Your dwelling.

11. For He shall give His angels charge over You, to keep You in all Your ways.

12. They shall bear You up in [their] hands, lest You dash your foot against a stone.

13. You shall tread on the lion and adder; the young lion and the jackal You shall trample underfoot.

14. Because He has set His love on Me, therefore I will deliver him; I will set Him on high, because He has known My name.

15. He shall call on Me, and I will answer Him; I [will be] with Him in trouble; I will deliver Him, and honor Him.

16. With long life I will satisfy him, and show him My salvation.

## Psalms 92

1. A Psalm or Song for the sabbath day. [It is] good to give thanks to the LORD, and to sing praises to Your name, O Most High;

2. to show forth Your loving-kindness in the morning, and Your faithfulness every night;

3. on the ten [strings], and on the harp, with sounding music on the lyre.

4. For You, LORD, have made Me glad with Your work; I will triumph in the works of Your hands.

5. O LORD, how great are Your works; Your purposes are very deep.

6. A beastly man does not know; nor does a fool understand this.

7. When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity blossom, [it is] that they shall be destroyed forever;

8. but You, LORD, are high forever.

9. For, lo, Your enemies, O LORD; for lo, Your enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

10. But You shall lift up my horn as the wild ox; and I shall be anointed with fresh oil.

11. Also my eye shall see [my desire] on my enemies, and my ears shall hear the wicked who rise up against me.

12. The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.

13. Those that are planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.

14. They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flowering;

15. to show that the LORD [is] upright; [He is] my rock, and no unrighteousness [is] in Him.

## Psalms 93

1. The LORD reigns, He is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength. He clothed Himself and the world is established; it shall not be shaken.

2. Your throne [is] established of old; You [are] from everlasting.

3. The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voices; the floods lift up their waves.

4. The LORD on high [is] mightier than the noise of many waters, than the mighty waves of the sea.

5. Your testimonies are very sure; holiness becomes Your house forever, O LORD.

## Psalms 94

1. O God of vengeance, Jehovah, God of vengeance, shine forth!

2. Lift up Yourself, Judge of the earth; give a just repayment to the proud.

3. How long [shall] the wicked, O LORD, how long shall the wicked exult?

4. They gush; they speak impudent things; all the workers of iniquity speak proudly.

5. They crush Your people, O LORD, and afflict Your inheritance.

6. They kill the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.

7. Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, nor shall the God of Jacob observe [it].

8. Understand, you beastly ones among the people; and fools, when will you be wise?

9. He who planted the ear, shall He not hear? He who formed the eye, shall He not see?

10. He who chastens the nations, shall He not correct, He who teaches man knowledge?

11. The LORD knows the thoughts of man, that they [are] vain.

12. Blessed [is] the man whom You chasten, O LORD, to teach him out of Your law;

13. that You may give him rest from the days of trouble, until the pit is dug for the wicked.

14. For the LORD will not cast off His people, nor will He forsake His inheritance.

15. But judgment shall return to righteousness; and all the upright in heart shall follow it.

16. Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?

17. Unless the LORD [had been] my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.

18. When I said, My foot slips; Your mercy, O LORD, held me up.

19. In the multitude of my thoughts within me Your comforts delight my soul.

20. Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship [with] You, which frames mischief by a law?

21. They gather themselves against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.

22. But the LORD is my defense; and my God [is] the rock of my refuge.

23. And He will bring on them their own iniquity, and He will cut them off in their evil. The LORD our God shall cut them off.

6. Oh come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the LORD our maker.

7. For He [is] our God, and we [are] the people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand. Today if you will hear His voice,

8. harden not your heart, as [in the day] of strife, as [in the day] of testing in the wilderness;

9. when your fathers tempted Me, tested Me, and saw My work.

10. For forty years I was grieved with [this] generation, and said, It [is] a people who go astray in their hearts, and they have not known My ways;

3. For my days go up like smoke, and my bones glow like a firebrand.

4. My heart is stricken, and dried like grass, so that I forget to eat my bread.

5. Because of the voice of my groaning, my bones hold fast to my skin.

6. I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am like an owl of the desert.

7. I watch, and am as a sparrow alone on the house top.

8. My enemies curse me all the day; and they who are mad against me are sworn against me.

10. because of Your anger and Your wrath; for You have lifted me up and cast me down.

11. My days [are] like a shadow stretched out; and I wither like grass.

12. But You, O LORD, shall endure forever; and Your memory to all generations.

13. You shall arise, [and] have mercy on Zion; for the time to pity her, yea, the set time, has come.

14. For Your servants take pleasure in its stones, and pity its dust.

15. So the nations shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth Your glory.

16. When the LORD shall build up Zion, He shall appear in His glory.

17. He will turn to the prayer of the forsaken and not despise their prayer.

18. This shall be written for the generation to come; and the people who shall be created shall praise the LORD.

19. For He has looked down from the height of His sanctuary; from Heaven the LORD beheld the earth;

20. to hear the groaning of the prisoner, to set free the sons of death;

21. to declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and His praise in Jerusalem;

22. when the peoples and the kingdoms have gathered together to serve the LORD.

23. He weakened my strength in the way; He shortened my days.

24. I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days; Your years [are] through the generation of generations.

25. Of old You have laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens [are] the work of Your hands.

26. They shall perish, but You shall endure; yea, all of them shall become old like a garment; like a robe You shall change them, and they shall be changed;

27. but You [are] He, and Your years shall have no end.

28. The sons of Your servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before You.

## Psalms 103

1. [A Psalm] of David. Bless the LORD, O my soul; and all that is within me, [bless] His holy name.

2. Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits;

3. who forgives all your iniquities; who heals all your diseases;

4. who redeems your life from ruin; who crowns you [with] loving-kindness and tender mercies;

5. who satisfies your mouth with good; your youth is renewed like the eagle's.

6. The LORD works righteousness and judgment for all who are pressed down.

7. He made known His ways to Moses, His acts to the sons of Israel.

8. The LORD [is] merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and rich in mercy.

9. He will not always chasten, nor will He keep His [anger] forever.

10. He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.

11. For as the heavens [are] high above the earth, [so] is His mercy toward those who fear Him.

12. As far as the east [is] from the west, [so] far has He removed our transgressions from us.

13. As a father pities his children, the LORD pities those who fear Him.

14. For He knows our form; He remembers that we [are] dust.

15. [As for] man, his days [are] as grass; as a flower of the field, so he flourishes.

16. For the wind passes over it, and it is gone; and its place shall know it no more.

17. But the mercy of the LORD [is] from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear Him, and His righteousness [is] to sons of sons;

18. to those who keep His covenant, and to those who remember to do His commandments.

19. The LORD has prepared His throne in the heavens; and His kingdom rules over all.

20. Bless the LORD, O angels of His, who excel in strength, who do His command, listening to the voice of His word.

22. Bless the LORD, all His works in all places of His rule; bless the LORD, O my soul.

## Psalms 104

1. Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, You are very great; You have put on honor and majesty,

2. covering Yourself [with] light as with a robe; and stretching out the heavens like a curtain;

3. He lays the beams [of] His upper rooms in the waters. He sets the clouds [as] His chariots; He walks on the wings of the wind;

4. He makes His angels spirits, His ministers a flaming fire.

5. He laid the earth on its foundations; it shall not be shaken forever.

6. You covered the deep as with a robe; the waters stand above the mountains.

7. At Your rebuke they flee; at the voice of Your thunder they hurry away.

8. They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys to the place which You have founded for them.

9. You have set a bound that they may not pass over, so that they do not turn again to cover the earth.

10. [He] sends the springs into the valleys; they flow between the hills.

11. They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild asses break their thirst.

12. By them the birds of the heavens will have their place of rest; they sing among the branches.

13. [He] waters the hills from His upper rooms; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of Your works.

14. He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and plants for the service of man, to bring forth food out of the earth,

15. and wine cheers the heart of man, and oil makes his face shine, and bread sustains the heart of man.

16. The trees of the LORD [are] full, the cedars of Lebanon which He has planted;

17. where the birds make their nests; the fir trees [are] the house of the stork.

18. The high hills [are] for the wild goats, and the rocks [are] a refuge for the badgers.

19. He appointed the moon for seasons; the sun knows its going down.

20. You make darkness, and it is night, in which all the beasts of the forest creep forth.

21. The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from God.

22. The sun rises; they are gathered, and go to their dens to lie down.

23. Man goes out to his work and to his labor until the evening.

24. O LORD, how many are Your works! In wisdom You have made them all; the earth is full of Your riches.

25. This [is] the great and wide sea, in which [are] creeping things without number, both small and great animals.

26. There the ships go; You made this great sea animal to play in it.

27. These all wait on You, that You may give them their food in due season.

28. You give to them, they gather; You open Your hand; they [are] filled with good.

29. You hide Your face, they [are] troubled; You take away their breath, they die and return to their dust.

30. You send forth Your Spirit, they are created; and You renew the face of the earth.

31. The glory of the LORD shall endure forever; the LORD shall rejoice in His works.

32. He looks on the earth, and it trembles; He touches the hills, and they smoke.

33. I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.

34. My thoughts of Him shall be sweet; I will be glad in the LORD.

35. Let the sinners perish from the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, O my soul. Praise the LORD!

4. Seek the LORD and His strength; seek His face evermore.

5. Remember His marvelous works which He has done, His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth,

6. seed of His servant Abraham, sons of Jacob His chosen.

7. He [is] the LORD our God; His judgments [are] in all the earth.

8. He has remembered His covenant forever, the word [which] He commanded to a thousand generations;

9. the covenant which He made with Abraham, and His oath to Isaac;

10. and He confirmed it to Jacob for a law, and to Israel [for] an everlasting covenant,

11. saying, To you I will give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;

12. when they were [a few] men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.

13. When they went from one nation to another, from a kingdom to another people,

14. He allowed no man to do them wrong; yea, He reproved kings for their sakes,

15. [saying], Touch not my anointed, and do My prophets no harm.

16. And He called for a famine on the land; He broke the whole staff of bread.

17. He sent a man before them, Joseph, [being] sold for a servant;

18. whose feet they hurt with chains; he was laid in iron,

19. until the time that his word came, the word of the LORD refined him.

20. The king sent and set him free; the ruler of the people, and let him go free.

21. He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all he owned,

22. to chain his leaders at his pleasure, and teach his elders wisdom.

23. Israel also came [into] Egypt, and Jacob resided in the land of Ham.

24. And He increased His people greatly and made them stronger than their enemies.

25. He turned their heart to hate His people, to deal craftily with His servants.

26. He sent Moses His servant, [and] Aaron whom He had chosen.

27. They showed His signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.

28. He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they did not rebel against His word.

29. He turned their waters into blood, and killed their fish.

30. Their land swarmed with frogs in the rooms of their kings.

31. He spoke, and there came [fly] swarms and gnats in all their borders.

32. He gave them hail [for] rain [and] flaming fire in their land.

33. He struck their vines also and their fig trees, and broke the trees of their borders.

34. [He] spoke, and locusts came, and larvae without number;

35. and they ate up all the plants in their land, and ate the fruit of their ground.

36. He also struck all the first-born in their land, the chief of all their strength.

37. He also brought them out with silver and gold; and there [was] not one feeble person among their tribes.

38. Egypt was glad when they departed; for the fear of them had fallen on them.

39. He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light [in] the night.

40. [They] asked, and He brought quail, and satisfied them [with] the food of heaven.

41. He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places [like] a river.

42. For He remembered His holy promise [and] Abraham His servant.

43. And He brought forth His people with joy, and His chosen with gladness,

44. and gave them the lands of the nations; and they inherited the labor of the people,

45. so that they might take heed to His statutes and keep His laws. Praise the LORD!

## Psalms 106

1. Praise the LORD. O give thanks to the LORD; for [He is] good; for His mercy [endures] forever.

2. Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD, or cause all His praise to be heard?

3. Blessed [are] those who keep judgment, he who does righteousness at all times.

4. Remember me, O LORD, with the favor of Your people; O visit me with Your salvation,

5. that I may see the good of Your chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, to glory with Your inheritance.

6. We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.

7. Our fathers did not understand Your wonders in Egypt; they did not remember the multitude of Your mercies, but rebelled at the sea, even at the Red Sea.

8. But He saved them for His name's sake, to make His mighty power known.

9. And He rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up; so He led them through the depths, [as] through the wilderness.

10. And He saved them from the hand of the hater, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

11. And the waters covered their enemies; there was not one of them left.

12. Then they believed His words; they sang His praise.

13. They hurried [and] forgot His works; they did not wait for His counsel;

14. but they lusted greedily in the wilderness, and tested God in the desert.

15. And He gave them what they asked, but sent leanness into their soul.

16. And they were jealous of Moses in the camp, [and] Aaron the saint of the LORD.

17. The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.

18. And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.

19. They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped the melted image.

20. And they changed their Glory into the likeness of an ox that eats grass.

21. They forgot God their Deliverer, who had done great things in Egypt;

22. wonderful works in the land of Ham, fearful things by the Red Sea.

23. And He said that He would destroy them, if Moses His chosen had not stood before Him in the breach, to turn away His wrath, so that He should not destroy [them].

24. And they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe His word,

25. but murmured in their tents, [and] did not listen to the voice of the LORD.

26. And He lifted up His hand to them, to overthrow them in the wilderness;

27. to overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.

28. And they joined themselves to Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead,

29. and provoked [Him] to anger with their doings; and the plague broke in on them.

30. Then Phinehas stood and interceded, and the plague was stayed.

31. And it was counted to him for righteousness to all generations forevermore.

32. And they angered [Him] at the waters of strife so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;

33. because they provoked his spirit so that he spoke rashly with his lips.

34. They did not destroy the nations [as] the LORD commanded them;

35. but were mixed among the nations, and learned their works.

36. And they served their idols, which were a snare to them.

37. Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons,

38. and shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; and the land was defiled with blood.

39. And they were defiled with their works, and went lusting in their doings.

40. And the wrath of the LORD was kindled against His people, and He detested His inheritance.

41. And He gave them into the hand of the nations; and those who hated them ruled over them.

42. And their enemies oppressed them, and they were humbled under their hand.

43. Many times He delivered them, but they rebelled in their counsel and sank in their iniquities.

44. And He looked on their affliction when He heard their cry;

45. and He remembered [His] covenant for them, and was moved to pity, according to the multitude of His mercies.

46. And He gave them to tender mercies before the face of all their captors.

47. Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks to Your holy name [and] to triumph in Your praise.

48. Blessed [is] the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting; and let all the people say, Amen. Praise the LORD!

## Psalms 107

1. O give thanks to the LORD, for [He is] good; for His mercy [endures] forever.

2. Let the redeemed of the LORD say [so], whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy,

3. and gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.

4. They wandered in the wilderness, in a desert by the way; they found no city to dwell in.

5. Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.

6. Then they cried to the LORD in their distress, and He delivered them out of their troubles.

7. And He guided them by the right way, so as to go to a city to live in.

8. Oh that men would praise the LORD [for] His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the sons of man!

9. For He satisfies the thirsty soul, and fills the hungry soul [with] good.

10. Those who sit in the darkness and in the shadow of death, [being] chained in affliction and iron;

11. because they rebelled against the words of God, and despised the advice of the Most High.

12. and He humbled their heart with labor; they fell down, and none [was] helping.

13. Then they cried to the LORD in their distress, [and] He saved them out of their troubles.

14. He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke their bands in two.

15. Let them praise the LORD [for] His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the sons of man!

16. For He has broken the gates of bronze, and cut the bars of iron in two.

17. Fools are afflicted because of their rebellion, and because of their iniquities.

18. Their soul hates all kinds of food; and they draw near the gates of death.

19. Then they cry to the LORD in their distress, [and] He saves them out of their troubles.

20. He sent His word and heals them, and delivers [them] from their pitfalls.

21. Let them praise the LORD [for] His goodness, and [for] His wonderful works to the sons of man!

22. And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare His works with rejoicing!

23. They who go down to the sea in ships, who do business in great waters;

24. these see the works of the LORD and His wonders in the deep.

25. For He commands and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up its waves.

26. They mount up to the heavens, they go down again [to] the depths; their soul is melted because of trouble.

27. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and all their wisdom is swallowed up.

28. And they cry to the LORD in their trouble, and He brings them out of their troubles.

29. He makes the storm a calm, so that its waves are still.

30. And they are glad because they are quiet; so He brings them to their desired haven.

31. Let them praise the LORD [for] His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the sons of man!

32. And let them exalt Him in the congregation of the people, and praise Him in the gathering of the elders.

33. He sets rivers to a wilderness and water-springs to thirsty ground;

34. a fruitful land to a salty desert, because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it.

35. He turns the wilderness into a water-ponds, and dry ground into water-springs.

36. And He makes the hungry dwell there, so that they may prepare a city to live in;

37. and sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.

38. He also blesses them, so that they are multiplied greatly; and does not allow their cattle to become few.

39. Again, they have become few, and humbled through harshness, affliction, and sorrow.

40. He pours scorn on nobles, and causes them to wander in the wilderness, [where there is] no path.

41. But He raises up the poor from affliction and sets families like a flock.

42. The upright shall see and rejoice; and all iniquity shall stop its mouth.

43. Whoever [is] wise, and will observe these [things], they shall understand the mercies of the LORD.

## Psalms 108

1. A Song, A Psalm of David. O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and I will give praise, even [with] my glory.

2. Awake, harp and lyre; I will awake early.

3. I will praise You, O LORD, among the peoples; and I will sing praises to You among the nations.

4. For Your mercy [is] great above the heavens; and Your truth [reaches] to the clouds.

5. Be lifted up, O God, above the heavens; and Your glory above all the earth;

6. so that Your beloved may be delivered; save [with] Your right hand, and answer me.

7. God has spoken in His holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and I will measure out the valley of Succoth.

8. Gilead [is] Mine; Manasseh [is] Mine and Ephraim [is] the strength [of] My head; Judah [is] My lawgiver;

9. Moab [is] My washpot; I will cast out My shoe over Edom; I will triumph over Philistia.

10. Who will bring me into the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom?

11. O God, have You not cast us off? And, O God, will You not go out with our armies?

12. Give us help from trouble; for vain [is] the deliverance of man.

13. Through God we shall do mighty things; for He shall trample our enemies.

## Psalms 109

1. To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. O God of my praise, do not be silent;

2. for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me; they spoke against me [with] a lying tongue.

3. And they surrounded me [with] words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.

4. For my love they are my foes; but I [am in] prayer.

5. And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.

6. Set a wicked man over him; and let an adversary stand at his right hand,

7. when he is judged, let him be condemned; and let his prayer become sin.

8. Let his days be few; let another take his office.

9. Let his sons be fatherless, and his wife a widow.

10. Let his sons always beg and be vagabonds, and seek [food] out of their ruins.

11. Let the money-lender lay a snare for all that [is] his; and let strangers take the fruit of his labor.

12. Let there be none to give mercy to him; nor [any] to favor his fatherless children.

13. Let his posterity be cut off; [and] in the generation following let their name be blotted out.

14. Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered to the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

15. Let them be always before the LORD, that He may cut off their memory from the earth,

16. because he did not remember to do mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, and sought to kill the broken-hearted.

17. Yea, he loved cursing, so let it come to him; he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him.

18. As he clothed himself with cursing, as with his robe, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.

19. Let it be to him as the robe [which] covers him, and for a girdle with which he is always clothed.

20. This [is] the reward of my foes from the LORD, and [of] them who speak evil against my soul.

21. But You, Lord Jehovah, deal kindly with me for Your name's sake; because Your mercy [is] good, deliver me.

22. For I [am] poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.

23. As a shadow when it is stretched out, I am gone; I am shaken off like the locust.

24. My knees stumble from fasting; and my flesh is losing its fatness.

25. And I became a shame to them; they looked on me; they shook their heads.

26. Help me, O LORD my God; save me according to Your mercy;

27. and they will know that this [is] Your hand; that You, LORD, have done it.

28. They will curse, but You will bless; they arise, and are ashamed; but let Your servant rejoice.

29. Let my foes be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own shame, as with a cloak.

30. I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise Him among the multitude.

31. For He shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save [him] from those who condemn his soul.

## Psalms 110

1. A Psalm of David. The LORD said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I place Your enemies as Your footstool.

2. The LORD shall send the rod of Your strength out of Zion; rule in the midst of Your enemies.

3. Your people [shall be] willing in the day of Your power, in holy adornment from the womb of the morning: You [have] the dew of Your youth.

4. The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You [are] a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.

5. The Lord at Your right hand shall strike through kings in the day of His wrath.

6. He shall judge among the nations, He shall fill them with dead bodies; He shall shatter heads over much of the earth.

7. He shall drink of the brook in the way; therefore He shall lift up the head.

## Psalms 111

1. Praise the LORD! I will praise the LORD with all [my] heart, in the council of the upright, and of the congregation.

8. standing fast forever and ever; [they are] done in truth and uprightness.

9. He sent redemption to His people; He has commanded His covenant forever; holy and awesome [is] His name.

10. The fear of the LORD [is] the beginning of wisdom; all practicing them [have] good understanding; His praise stands forever.

## Psalms 112

1. Praise the LORD! Blessed [is] the man who fears the LORD, who delights greatly in His commandments.

2. His seed shall be mighty on earth; the generation of the upright shall be blessed.

3. Wealth and riches [shall be] in his house, and his righteousness stands forever.

4. To the upright there arises light in the darkness; [he is] gracious and full of pity and righteousness.

5. A good man shows favor, and lends; he will guide his business with fairness.

6. Surely he shall not be moved forever; the righteous shall be remembered forever.

7. He shall not be afraid of bad news; his heart [is] fixed, trusting in the LORD.

8. His heart [is] sure; he shall not be afraid [though] he sees his oppressors.

9. He has scattered abroad; he has given to the poor; his righteousness [endures] forever; his horn shall be lifted up with honor.

10. The wicked shall see and be vexed; he shall gnash with his teeth and melt away; the desire of the wicked shall perish.

## Psalms 113

1. Praise the LORD! Praise, O servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD.

2. Blessed [is] the name of the LORD from this time forth and forevermore.

3. From the rising of the sun to its going down, the LORD's name [is] to be praised.

4. The LORD [is] high above all nations, and His glory above the heavens.

5. Who [is] like the LORD our God, who dwells on high,

6. who humbles [Himself] to behold [the] [things] in the heavens and in the earth!

7. He raises up the poor out of the dust, [and] lifts the needy out of the dunghill,

8. in order to make him sit with nobles, with the nobles of his people.

9. He causes the barren to dwell in the house [as] a joyful mother of sons. Praise the LORD!

## Psalms 114

1. When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language,

2. Judah was His sanctuary, [and] Israel was His kingdom.

3. The sea saw [it] and fled; Jordan was driven back.

4. The mountains skipped like rams, [and] the little hills like lambs.

5. What [ailed] you, O sea, [that] you fled? O Jordan, that you turned back,

6. O mountains [that] skipped like rams, O little hills like lambs?

7. Earth, tremble at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the God of Jacob,

8. who turned the rock [into] a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.

## Psalms 115

1. Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to Your name give glory, for Your mercy [and] for Your truth's sake.

2. Why should the nations say, Where now [is] their God?

3. But our God [is] in Heaven; He has done whatever He has pleased.

4. Their idols [are] silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

5. They [have] mouths, but they do not speak; they [have] eyes, but they do not see;

6. they [have] ears, but they do not hear; they [have] noses, but they do not smell;

7. they have hands, but they do not handle; they have feet, but they do not walk; they do not mutter through their throat.

8. The ones who make them are like them, [and] everyone who trusts in them.

9. O Israel, trust in the LORD; He [is] their help and their shield.

10. O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD; He [is] their help and their shield.

11. You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD; He [is] their help and their shield.

12. The LORD has been mindful of us; He will bless [us]; He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron.

13. He will bless those who fear the LORD, [both] small and great.

14. The LORD shall add on to you, even on you and on your sons.

15. You [are] blessed of the LORD who made the heavens and the earth.

16. The heavens, [even] the heavens, [are] the LORD's; but the earth He has given to the sons of men.

17. The dead do not praise the LORD, nor do any who go down into silence.

18. But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and forevermore. Praise the LORD!

## Psalms 116

8. For You have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from falling.

9. I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.

8. [It is] better to trust in the LORD than to trust in man.

9. [It is] better to trust in the LORD than to trust in princes.

10. All the nations surround me, but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.

11. They surround me; yea, they surround me, but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.

13. You have thrust hard at me so that I might fall; but the LORD helped me.

14. The LORD [is] my strength and song, and He is my salvation.

15. The voice of rejoicing and salvation [is] in the tents of the righteous; the right hand of the LORD does mighty things.

16. The right hand of the LORD is lifted up; the right hand of the LORD does mighty things.

4. The LORD [is] righteous; He cuts off the cords of the wicked.

5. Let them all be ashamed and turned back, those who hate Zion.

4. I will not give sleep to my eyes, [nor] slumber to my eyelids,

5. until I find out a place for the LORD, a dwelling-place for the Mighty One of Jacob.

8. [He] who struck the first-born of Egypt, both of man and animal;

9. [who] sent signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, on Pharaoh and on all his servants;

10. who struck great nations and killed mighty kings,

11. Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan,

12. and gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance to Israel His people.

13. Your name, O LORD, [endures] forever, and Your memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.

14. For the LORD will judge His people, and He will have pity on His servants.

15. The idols of the nations [are] silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

16. They [have] mouths, but they do not speak; they [have] eyes, but they do not see;

17. they [have] ears, but they do not hear, nor is there breath in their mouths.

18. Those who make them are like them, everyone who trusts in them.

19. Bless the LORD, O house of Israel; bless the LORD, O house of Aaron;

2. You know my sitting down and my rising up; You understand my thought afar off.

4. For [there is] not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, You know it altogether.

5. You have closed me in behind and in front, and laid Your hand on me.

16. Your eyes saw my embryo; and in Your book all [my members] were written, the days they were formed, and not one [was] among them.

17. How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How great is the sum of them!

18. [If] I should count them, they are more than the sand; when I awake, I am still with You.

19. Surely You will slay the wicked, O God; and bloody men, depart from me.

20. Who will speak against You maliciously? Your enemies are lifted up with vanity.

21. O LORD, do I not hate those who hate You? And am I [not] grieved with those who rise up against You?

22. I hate them [with] perfect hatred; I count them my enemies.

6. I stretch forth my hands to You; my soul [thirsts] after You like a thirsty land. Selah.

7. Hear me quickly, O LORD; my spirit fails; do not hide Your face from me, lest I be like those who go down into the Pit.

8. Cause me to hear Your loving-kindness in the morning, for I do trust in You; cause me to know the way in which I should walk, for I lift up my soul to You.

9. Deliver me, O LORD, from my enemies; I flee to You to hide me.

10. Teach me to do Your will; for You [are] my God; Your Spirit [is] good; lead me into the land of uprightness.

6. Cast forth lightning and scatter them; shoot out Your arrows and destroy them.

8. because their mouth has spoken vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of lies.

9. I will sing a new song to You, O God; on a harp of ten strings I will sing praises to You.

12. so that our sons [may be] like plants grown up in their youth; and our daughters [may be] like corner-stones, polished like a palace building;

13. and our storehouses [may be] full, furnishing kind to kind; and our flocks may breed thousands and ten thousands outside;

14. and our oxen [may be] loaded; [there is] no break in nor going out and no crying in our streets.
