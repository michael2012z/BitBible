# Colossians

## Colossians 1

1. Paul, [an] apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy [our] brother,

2. to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colosse. Grace to you, and peace from God our Father and from [the] Lord Jesus Christ.

3. We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,

4. since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love [you have] to all the saints,

5. for the hope which is laid up for you in Heaven, of which you heard before in the Word of the truth of the gospel,

6. which has come to you as [it has] also in all the world, and it is bearing fruit, even also among you, since the day you heard and fully knew the grace of God in truth,

7. even as you learned from Epaphras our beloved fellow-servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ for you,

8. he also having shown your love in [the] Spirit to us.

9. For this cause we also, since the day we heard, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled [with] the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding,

10. that you might walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing, being fruitful in every work and increasing in the knowledge of God,

11. being empowered with all power, according to the might of His glory, to all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness,

12. giving thanks to the Father, who has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.

13. [For He] has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated [us] into the kingdom of His dear Son;

14. in whom we have redemption through His blood, the remission of sins.

15. who is [the] image of the invisible God, [the] First-born of all creation.

16. For all things were created in Him, the things in the heavens, and the things on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers, all things were created through Him and for Him.

17. And He is before all things, and by Him all things consist.

18. And He is [the] Head of the body, the church, who is [the] Beginning, the First-born from the dead, that He may be pre-eminent in all things.

19. For it pleased [the Father] that in Him all fullness should dwell.

20. And through Him having made peace through the blood of His cross, it pleased the Father to reconcile all things to Himself through Him, whether the things on earth or the things in Heaven.

21. And you, who were once alienated and enemies in [your] mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled

22. in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish, and without charge in His sight,

23. if indeed you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and [are] not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you have heard [and] which was proclaimed in all the creation under Heaven, of which I, Paul, became a minister,

24. who now rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and I fill up the things lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh, on behalf of His body, which [is] the church;

25. of which I became a minister, according to the administration of God given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God;

26. the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but now has been revealed to His saints.

27. [For to them] God would make known what [are] the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory,

28. whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, so that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.

29. For which I also labor, striving according to the working of Him who works in me in power.

## Colossians 2

1. For I want you to know what a great conflict I have for you and those at Laodicea, and [for] as many as have not seen my face in [the] flesh,

2. that their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of the understanding, to [the] full knowledge of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;

3. in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

4. And I say this that not anyone should beguile you with enticing words.

5. For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in the spirit, rejoicing and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.

6. Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, [so] walk in Him,

7. rooted and built up in Him, and established in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving.

8. Beware lest anyone rob you through philosophy and vain deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.

9. For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.

10. And you are complete in Him, who is the Head of all principality and power,

11. in whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ,

12. buried with Him in baptism, in whom also you were raised through the faith of the working of God, raising Him from the dead.

13. And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He has made alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses,

14. blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross.

15. Having stripped rulers and authorities, He made a show of them publicly, triumphing [over] them in it.

16. Therefore let no one judge you in food or in drink, or in respect of a feast, or of the new moon, or of the sabbaths.

17. For these are a shadow of things to come, but the body [is] of Christ.

18. Let no one defraud you, delighting in humility and worship of the angels, intruding into things which he has not seen, without a cause [being] vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,

19. and not holding the Head, from whom all the body, having been supplied through the joints and bands, and having been joined together, will grow with the growth of God.

20. If then you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as [though] living in [the] world, are you subject to [its] ordinances:

21. touch not, taste not, handle not;

22. which things are all for corruption in the using, according to the commands and doctrines of men?

23. [These] things indeed have a reputation of wisdom in self-imposed worship and humility, and unsparing severity of the] body, not in any honor for the satisfying of the flesh.

## Colossians 3

1. If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is sitting at [the] right hand of God.

2. Be mindful of things above, not on things on the earth.

3. For you died, and your life has been hidden with Christ in God.

4. When Christ our Life [is] revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.

5. Therefore put to death your members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness (which is idolatry),

6. on account of which things' sake the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience,

7. among whom you also once walked, when you lived in these.

8. But now also put off all [these] things: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, shameful speech out of your mouth.

9. Do not lie to one another, having put off the old man with his deeds

10. and having put on the new, having been renewed in knowledge according to [the] image of Him who created him,

11. where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythian, slave [or] freeman, but Christ [is] all things in all.

12. Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender feelings of mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering,

13. forbearing one another and forgiving yourselves, if anyone has a complaint against any. As Christ forgave you, so also you [do].

14. And above all these things [put on] love, which is [the] bond of perfectness.

15. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which you also are called in one body, and be thankful.

16. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

17. And everything, whatever you do in word or deed, [do] all in the name of [the] Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and [the] Father by Him.

18. Wives, be subject to [your] own husbands, as is becoming in [the] Lord.

19. Husbands, love [your] wives, and do not be bitter against them.

20. Children, obey [your] parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing to the Lord.

21. Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they be discouraged.

22. Slaves, obey [your] masters according to the flesh in all things; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God.

23. And whatever you do, do [it] heartily, as to the Lord and not to men;

24. knowing that from the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance. For you serve [the] Lord Christ.

25. But he who does wrong shall receive [justice] for the wrong which he did, and there is no respect of persons.

## Colossians 4

1. Masters, give to [your] slaves what [is] just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in Heaven.

2. Continue in prayer and watch in it with thanksgiving,

3. praying together about us also, that God may open to us a door of the Word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I also have been bound,

4. that I may make it clear, as I ought to speak.

5. Walk in wisdom toward those on the outside, redeeming the time.

6. Let your speech [be] always with grace, having been seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.

7. Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-servant in [the] Lord, will make known to you all things about me.

8. I sent [him] to you for this very purpose, that he might know the things about you, and that he might comfort your hearts,

9. along with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is [one] of you. They shall make known to you all things here.

10. Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (regarding whom you received commandments; if he comes to you, receive him),

11. and [greetings from] Jesus, who is called Justus, those being of the circumcision. These alone [are my] fellow-workers for the kingdom of God, who became a comfort to me.

12. Epaphras greets you, he being of you, a servant of Christ, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.

13. For I bear him record that he has a great zeal for you and for those [who are] in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis.

14. Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.

15. Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church in his house.

16. And when this letter is read before you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you also read the [letter] of Laodicea.

17. And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in [the] Lord, that you fulfill it.

18. The salutation of Paul, by my own hand. Remember my bonds. Grace [be] with you. Amen.
