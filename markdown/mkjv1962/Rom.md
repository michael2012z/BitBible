## Romans 1

1. Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, a called apostle, separated to the gospel of God

2. (which He had promised beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures),

3. about His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh,

4. who was marked out the Son of God in power, according to [the] Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from [the] dead;

5. by whom we have received grace and apostleship, to obedience to the faith among all nations, for His name;

6. among whom you also are the called-out ones of Jesus Christ:

7. to all those who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be] saints. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.

8. First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.

9. For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you

10. always in my prayers, making request if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come to you.

11. For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to you for the establishing of you.

12. And this is to be comforted together with you by our mutual faith, both yours and mine.

13. But I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that oftentimes I purposed to come to you, and was kept back until the present; that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other nations.

14. I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the foreigners, both to the wise and to the unwise.

15. So, as much as is in me [lies], I am ready to preach the gospel to you who are at Rome also.

16. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is [the] power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

17. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, The just shall live by faith.

18. For the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness,

19. because the thing which may be known of God is clearly revealed within them, for God revealed [it] to them.

20. For the unseen things of Him from [the] creation of [the] world [are] clearly seen, being realized by the things that are made, [even] His eternal power and Godhead, for them to be without excuse.

21. Because, knowing God, they did not glorify Him as God, neither were thankful. But [they] became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.

22. Professing to be wise, they became fools

23. and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man, and birds, and four-footed animals, and creeping things.

24. Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of [their] hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves.

25. For they changed the truth of God into a lie, and they worshiped and served the created thing more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.

26. For this cause, God gave them up to dishonorable affections. For even their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature.

27. And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another; males with males working out shamefulness, and receiving in themselves the recompense which was fitting for their error.

28. And even as they did not think fit to have God in [their] knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do the things not right,

29. being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; [being] full of envy, murder, quarrels, deceit, evil habits, [becoming] whisperers,

30. backbiters, haters of God, insolent, proud, braggarts, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,

31. undiscerning, perfidious, without natural] affection, unforgiving, unmerciful;

32. who, knowing the righteous order of God, that those practicing such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but have pleasure in those practicing [them].

## Romans 2

1. Therefore you are without excuse, O man, everyone who judges; for in that in which you judge another, you condemn yourself, for you who judge do the same things.

2. But know that the judgment of God is according to truth on those who practice such things.

3. And, O man, the [one] judging those who do such things, and practice them, do you think this, that you shall escape the judgment of God?

4. Or do you despise the riches of His kindness, and the forbearance and long-suffering, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?

5. But according to your hardness and your impenitent heart, do you treasure up wrath for yourself in a day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,

6. who will render to each according to his works;

7. indeed to those who with patience [in] good work [are] seeking for glory, and honor, and incorruptibility, everlasting life.

8. But to those who indeed disobeying the truth out] of self-seeking, and obeying unrighteousness, will be] anger and wrath,

9. tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man who has worked out evil; of the Jew first, and also of the Greek.

10. But He [will give] glory, honor and peace to every man who works good, to [the] Jew first and also to [the] Greek.

11. For there is no respect of faces with God.

12. For as many as sinned without Law will also perish without Law. And as many as have sinned within Law shall be judged through Law.

13. For it is not the hearers of the Law who [are] just before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified.

14. For when the nations, who do not have the Law, do by nature the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law unto themselves;

15. who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and the thoughts between one another accusing or even excusing one another,

16. in a day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.

17. Behold, you are called a Jew, and rest in the Law, and boast in God;

18. and know [His] will and approve the things excelling, being instructed out of the Law;

19. and persuading yourselves to be a guide of the blind, a light to those in darkness;

20. an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, who have the form of knowledge and of the truth in the Law.

21. Therefore the [one] teaching another, do you not teach yourself? The [one] preaching not to steal, do you steal?

22. The [one] saying not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? The [one] detesting idols, do you rob temples?

23. [You] who boast in Law, do you dishonor God through breaking the Law?

24. For the name of God is blasphemed among the nations because of you, as it is written.

25. For circumcision truly profits if you keep [the] Law, but if you are a transgressor of the Law, circumcision becomes uncircumcision.

26. If then the uncircumcision keeps the ordinances of the Law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?

27. And the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the Law, shall it not judge you, who through letter and circumcision [become] transgressors of the Law?

28. For he is not a Jew who [is one] outwardly, nor [is] circumcision that outwardly in flesh;

29. but he [is] a Jew who [is one] inwardly, and circumcision [is] of the heart; in spirit and not in letter; whose praise [is] not from men, but from God.

## Romans 3

1. Then what [is] the superiority of the Jew? Or what [is] the profit of circumcision?

2. Much, by every way! Chiefly, indeed, because they were entrusted with the oracles of God.

3. For what? If some did not believe, will not their unbelief nullify the faith of God?

4. Let it not be! But let God be true, and every man a liar; as it is written, That You might be justified in Your sayings, and will overcome when You are judged.

5. But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what shall we say? [Is] God unrighteous who lays on wrath? (I speak as a man.)

6. Let it not be! For then how shall God judge the world?

7. For if in my lie the truth has more abounded to His glory why am I still judged as a sinner?

8. And not [rather], (as we are wrongly accused, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do bad things that good may come? [Their] condemnation is just.

9. What then? Do we excel? No, in no way; for we have before charged both Jews and Greeks all [with] being under sin,

10. as it is written: There is none righteous, no not one;

11. there is none that understands, there is none that seeks after God.

12. They are all gone out of the way, [they] have together become unprofitable, there is none that does good, no, not one.

13. Their throat [is] an open grave, with their tongues they have used deceit, [the] poison of asps [is] under their lips;

14. whose mouth [is] full of cursing and bitterness;

15. their feet [are] swift to shed blood;

16. destruction and misery [are] in their way,

17. and the way of peace they did not know.

18. There is no fear of God before their eyes.

19. But we know that whatever things the Law says, it says to those who are under the Law; so that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may be under judgment before God,

20. because by the works of the Law none of all flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law [is] the knowledge of sin.

21. But now a righteousness of God has been revealed apart from Law, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets;

22. even the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ, toward all and upon all those who believe. For there is no difference,

23. for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God,

24. being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;

25. whom God has set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness through the passing by of the sins that had taken place before, in the forbearance of God;

26. for the display of His righteousness at this time, for Him to be just and, forgiving the [one] being of the faith of Jesus.

27. Then where [is] the boasting? It is excluded. Through what law? Of works? No, but through the law of faith.

28. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the works of the law.

29. Or [is He] the God of the Jews only, and not also of the nations? Yes, of the nations also,

30. since [it is] one God who will justify circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.

31. Do we then make the Law void through faith? Let it not be! But we establish the Law.

## Romans 4

1. What then shall we say that our father Abraham has found, according to flesh?

2. For if Abraham was justified by works, he has a boast; but not before God.

3. For what does the Scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.

4. But to him working, the reward is not reckoned according to grace, but according to debt.

5. But to him not working, but believing on Him justifying the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.

6. Even as David also says of the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness without works,

7. [saying], Blessed are those whose lawlessnesses are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;

8. blessed [is] the man to whom [the] Lord will in no way impute sin.

9. [Is] this blessedness then on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision also? For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.

10. How then was it reckoned? Being in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.

11. And he received a sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith [while still] uncircumcised; so that he might be [the] father of all those believing through uncircumcision, for righteousness to be imputed to them also;

12. and a father of circumcision to those not of the circumcision only, but also to those walking by the steps of the faith of our father Abraham during uncircumcision.

13. For the promise that he should be the heir of the world [was] not to Abraham or to his seed through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith.

14. For if they of the Law [are] heirs, faith is made void and the promise is made of no effect;

15. because the Law works out wrath, for where no law is, [there is] no transgression.

16. Therefore [it is] of faith so that [it might be] according to grace; for the promise to be made sure to all the seed, not only to that which is of the Law, but to that also which is of  the] faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all

17. (as it has been written, I have made you a father of many nations) --before God, whom he believed, who makes the dead live, and calls the things [which] do not exist as [though they] do exist.

18. [For he] who beyond hope believed on hope for him to become the father of many nations (according to that which was spoken, So your seed shall be).

19. And not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body already dead (being about a hundred years old) or the deadening of Sarah's womb.

20. He did not stagger at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God,

21. and being fully persuaded that what God had promised, He was also able to perform.

22. And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.

23. Now it was not written for him alone that it was imputed to him,

24. but for us also to whom it is to be imputed, to the ones believing on Him who has raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;

25. who was delivered because of our offenses and was raised for our justification.

## Romans 5

1. Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.

2. Through Him we also have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice on the hope of the glory of God.

3. And not only [this], but we glory in afflictions also, knowing that afflictions work out patience,

4. and patience [works out] experience, and experience [works out] hope.

5. And hope does not make [us] ashamed, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through [the] Holy Spirit given to us.

6. For we yet being without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.

7. For one will with difficulty die for a righteous one, yet perhaps one would even dare to die for a good one.

8. But God commends His love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us.

9. Much more then, being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.

10. For if [when] we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.

11. And not only [so], but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation.

12. Therefore, even as through one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed on all men inasmuch as all sinned:

13. for until the Law sin was in [the] world, but sin is not imputed [when] there is no law.

14. But death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is the type of Him who was to come;

15. but the free gift [shall] not [be] also like the offense. For if by the offense of the one many died, much more the grace of God, and the gift in grace; which [is] of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many.

16. And the free gift [shall] not [be] as by one having sinned; (for indeed the judgment [was] of one to condemnation, but the free gift [is] of many offenses to justification.

17. For if by one man's offense death reigned by one, much more they who receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by One, Jesus Christ.)

18. Therefore as by one offense [sentence came] on all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousness of One the free gift [came] to all men to justification of life.

19. For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of One shall many be made righteous.

20. But the Law entered so that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound,

21. so that as sin has reigned to death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.

## Romans 6

1. What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin so that grace may abound?

2. Let it not be! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?

3. Do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death?

4. Therefore we were buried with Him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised up from [the] dead by the glory of the Father; even so we also should walk in newness of life.

5. For if we have been joined together in the likeness of His death, we shall also be [in the likeness] of His resurrection;

6. knowing this, that our old man is crucified with [Him] in order that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.

7. For he who died has been justified from sin.

8. But if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,

9. knowing that when Christ was raised from [the] dead, He dies no more; death no longer has dominion over Him.

10. For in that He died, He died to sin once; but in that He lives, He lives to God.

11. Likewise count yourselves also to be truly dead to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

12. Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.

13. Do not yield your members [as] instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but yield yourselves to God, as [one] alive from [the] dead, and your members [as] instruments of righteousness to God.

14. For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under Law, but under grace.

15. What then? Shall we sin because we are not under Law, but under grace? Let it not be!

16. Do you not know that to whom you yield yourselves [as] slaves for obedience, you are slaves to him whom you obey; whether it is of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness.

17. But thanks [be] to our God that you were the slaves of sin, but you have obeyed from [the] heart that form of doctrine to which you were delivered.

18. Then being made free from sin, you became the slaves of righteousness.

19. I speak in the manner of men because of the weakness of your flesh; for as you have yielded your members [as] slaves to uncleanness, and to lawless act unto lawless act, even so now yield your members as slaves to righteousness unto holiness.

20. For when you were the slaves of sin, you were free from righteousness.

21. What fruit did you have then [in those things] of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things [is] death.

22. But now, being made free from sin, and having become slaves to God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end everlasting life.

23. For the wages of sin [is] death, but the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

## Romans 7

1. Or are you ignorant, brothers; for I speak to those who know the Law; that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?

2. For the married woman was bound by law to the living husband. But if the husband is dead, she is set free from the law of [her] husband.

3. So then [if], while [her] husband lives, she is married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, [so that] she is no adulteress by becoming another man's wife.

4. So, my brothers, you also have become dead to the law by the body of Christ so that you should be married to Another, [even] to Him raised from [the] dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.

5. For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sin worked in our members through the law to bring forth fruit to death.

6. But now we having been set free from the Law, having died [to that] in which we were held, so that we serve in newness of spirit and not [in] oldness of the letter.

7. What shall we say then? [Is] the law sin? Let it not be said! But I did not know sin except through the law. For also I did not know lust except the law said, You shall not lust.

8. But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, worked in me all kinds of lust. For apart from law sin [was] dead.

9. For I was alive without the law once. But when the commandment came, sin revived and I died.

10. And the commandment, which [was] to life, was found [to be] death to me.

11. For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed [me].

12. So indeed the Law [is] holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good.

13. Then has that [which is] good become death to me? Let it not be! But sin, that it might appear [to be] sin, working death in me by [that which is] good; in order that sin might become exceedingly sinful by the commandment.

14. For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin.

15. For that which I do, I know not. For what I desire, that I do not do; but what I hate, that I do.

16. If then I do that which I do not desire, I consent to the law that [it is] good.

17. But now it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.

18. For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwells no good thing. For to will is present with me, but [how] to perform [that which is] good I do not find.

19. For I do not do the good that I desire; but the evil which I do not will, that I do.

20. But if I do what I do not desire, [it is] no more I working it out, but sin dwelling in me.

21. I find then a law: when I will to do the right, evil is present with me.

22. For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man;

23. but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin being in my members.

24. O wretched man [that] I [am]! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?

25. I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.

## Romans 8

1. [There is] therefore now no condemnation to those [who are] in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.

2. But the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.

3. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh;

4. so that the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.

5. For they who are according to the flesh mind the things of flesh, but they who are according to the Spirit the things of the Spirit.

6. For to be carnally minded [is] death, but to be spiritually minded [is] life and peace

7. because the carnal mind [is] enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can [it be].

8. So then they who are in the flesh cannot please God.

9. But you are not in the flesh, but in [the] Spirit, if [the] Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone has not [the] Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.

10. And if Christ [is] in you, indeed the body [is] dead because of sin, but the Spirit [is] life because of righteousness.

11. But if the Spirit of the [One] who raised up Jesus from [the] dead dwells in you, the [One] who raised up Christ from [the] dead shall also make your mortal bodies alive by His Spirit who dwells in you.

12. Therefore, brothers, we are not debtors to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.

13. For if you live according to the flesh, you shall die. But if you through [the] Spirit mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live.

14. For as many as are led by [the] Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.

15. For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption by which we cry, Abba, Father!

16. The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.

17. And if we are children, then we are heirs; heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ; so that if we suffer with [Him], we may also be glorified together.

18. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time [are] not worthy [to be compared] with the coming glory to be revealed in us.

19. For the earnest expectation of the creation waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.

20. For the creation was not willingly subjected to vanity, but because of Him who subjected [it] on hope

21. that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.

22. And we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.

23. And not only [so], but ourselves also, who have the firstfruit of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, awaiting adoption, the redemption of our body.

24. For we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen is not hope; for what anyone sees, why does he also hope [for it] ?

25. But if we hope for that which we do not see, [then] we wait for it with patience.

26. Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.

27. And He searching the hearts knows what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because He makes intercession for the saints according to [the will of] God.

28. And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to [His] purpose.

29. For whom He foreknew, He also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of His Son, for Him to be [the] First-born among many brothers.

30. But whom He predestinated, these He also called; and whom He called, those He also justified. And whom He justified, these He also glorified.

31. What then shall we say to these things? If God [is] for us, who [can be] against us?

32. Truly [He] who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?

33. Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? [It is] God who justifies.

34. Who [is] he condemning? [It is] Christ who has died, but rather also [who is] raised, who is also at [the] right [hand] of God, who also intercedes for us.

35. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? [Shall] tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?

36. As it is written, For Your sake we are killed all the day long. We are counted as sheep of slaughter.

37. But in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us.

38. For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,

39. nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

## Romans 9

1. I tell [the] truth in Christ, I do not lie, my conscience also bearing me witness in [the] Holy Spirit,

2. that I have great heaviness and continual pain in my heart.

3. For I myself was wishing to be accursed from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh,

4. who are Israelites; to whom [belong] the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the service [of God], and the promises;

5. whose [are] the fathers, and of whom [is] the Christ according to flesh, He being God over all, blessed forever. Amen.

6. Not however that the word of God has failed, for not all those of Israel [are] Israel;

7. nor because they are the seed of Abraham [are they] all children. But, In Isaac shall your Seed be called.

8. That is, not the children of the flesh [are] children of God; but the children of the promise [are] counted for a seed.

9. For this [is] the word of promise: At this time I will come and Sarah shall have a son.

10. And not only [this], but when Rebekah also had conceived by one, by our father Isaac

11. (for [the children] had not yet been born, neither had done any good or evil; but that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works but of Him who called,)

12. it was said to her, The elder shall serve the younger.

13. As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.

14. What shall we say then? [Is there] not unrighteousness with God? Let it not be!

15. For He said to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.

16. So then [it is] not of the [one] willing, nor of the [one] running, but of God, the [One] showing mercy.

17. For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose I have raised you up, that I might show My power in you, and that My name might be declared throughout all the earth.

18. Therefore He has mercy on whom He will [have mercy], and whom He will, He hardens.

19. You will then say to me, Why does He yet find fault? For who has resisted His will?

20. No, but, O man, who are you who replies against God? Shall the thing formed say to Him who formed [it], Why have you made me this way?

21. Does not the potter have power over the clay, from the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor?

22. [What] if God, willing to show His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction;

23. and that He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy which He had before prepared to glory;

24. whom He also called, not only us, of Jews, but also of the nations?

25. As He also says in Hosea, I will call those not My people, My people; and those not beloved, Beloved.

26. And it shall be, in the place where it was said to them. You [are] not My people; there they shall be called sons of the living God.

27. Isaiah also cries concerning Israel, Though the number of the sons of Israel is as the sands of the sea, a remnant shall be saved.

28. For [He is] bringing [the] matter to an end, and cutting short in righteousness, because [the] Lord will make a short work on the earth.

29. And as Isaiah said before, Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we would have been as Sodom, and would have been like Gomorrah.

30. What shall we say then? That the nations, who did not follow after righteousness have taken on righteousness, but a righteousness of faith.

31. But Israel, who followed after a law of righteousness did not arrive at a law of righteousness.

32. Why? Because [it was] not of faith, but as it were by the works of the Law. For they stumbled at that Stumbling-stone;

33. as it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a Stumbling-stone and a Rock-of-offense, and everyone believing on Him shall not be put to shame.

## Romans 10

1. Brothers, truly my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is for [it] to be saved.

2. For I bear record to them that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.

3. For they, being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.

4. For Christ [is] the end of the law for righteousness for everyone who believes.

5. For Moses writes [of] the righteousness [which] is of the Law, The man who does those things shall live by them.

6. But the righteousness of faith says this: Do not say in your heart, Who shall ascend into Heaven? that is, to bring Christ down;

7. or Who shall descend into the deep?; that is, to bring up Christ again from [the] dead.

8. But what does it say? The word is near you, [even] in your mouth and in your heart; that is, the word of faith which we proclaim;

9. Because if you confess the Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from [the] dead, you shall be saved.

10. For with [the] heart [one] believes unto righteousness, and with [the] mouth [one] confesses unto salvation.

11. For the Scripture says, Everyone believing on Him shall not be put to shame.

12. For there is no difference both of Jew and of Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call on Him.

13. For everyone, whoever shall call on the name of [the] Lord will be saved.

14. How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without preaching?

15. And how shall they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, How beautiful [are] the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things!

16. But [they have] not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report?

17. Then faith [is] of hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.

18. But I say, Have they not heard? Yes indeed, their voice went out into all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.

19. But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses says, I will provoke you to jealousy by [those who are] no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.

20. But Isaiah [is] very bold and says, I was found by those who did not seek Me, I became known to those who did not ask after Me.

21. But to Israel He says, All day long I have stretched forth My hands to a disobeying and gainsaying people.

## Romans 11

1. I say then, Did not God put away His people? Let it not be [said]! For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of [the] tribe of Benjamin.

2. God did not thrust out His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture said in Elijah, how he pleaded with God against Israel, saying,

3. Lord, they killed Your prophets and dug down Your altars, and I am left alone, and they seek my life.

4. But what does the Divine answer say to him? I have reserved to Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.

5. Even so then, also in this present time a remnant according to the election of grace has come into being.

6. But if by grace, then [it is] no more of works; otherwise grace is no more grace. But if [it is] of works, then it is no more of grace; otherwise work is no more work.

7. What then? Israel has not obtained that which it seeks, but the election obtained [it], and the rest were hardened

8. even as it is written, God gave to them a spirit of slumber, eyes not seeing, and ears not hearing until this day.

9. And David said, Let their table become for a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and a recompense to them.

10. Let their eyes be darkened so that they may not see, and their back always bowing.

11. I say then, Did they not stumble that they fall? Let it not be! But by their slipping away came salvation to the nations, to provoke them to jealousy.

12. But if their slipping away [is] the riches of [the] world, and their default is [the] riches of [the] nations, how much more their fullness?

13. For I speak to you, the nations; since I am the apostle of the nations, I glorify my ministry;

14. if by any means I may provoke [those who are] my flesh to jealousy, and might save some of them.

15. For if their casting away [is the] reconciling of [the] world, what [is] the reception except life from [the] dead?

16. For if the firstfruit [is] holy, the lump [is] also [holy]; and if the root [is] holy, also the branches.

17. And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and became a sharer of the root and the fatness of the olive tree with them,

18. do not boast against the branches. But if you boast, [it is] not you [that] bears the root, but the root bears you.

19. You will say then, The branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.

20. Well, because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Do not [be] high-minded, but fear.

21. For if God did not spare the natural branches, [fear] lest He also may not spare you either!

22. Behold then [the] kindness, and [the] severity of God; on those having fallen, severity; but on you, kindness, if you continue in the kindness. Otherwise you also will be cut off.

23. And those also, if they do not continue in unbelief, will be grafted in. For God is able to graft them in again.

24. For if you were cut out of the natural wild olive [tree], and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive [tree]; how much more these [being] according to nature will be grafted into [their] own olive-tree?

25. For I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, lest you should be wise within yourselves; that blindness in part has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the nations has comes in.

26. And so all Israel shall be saved; as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer, and He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.

27. For this [is] My covenant with them, when I have taken away their sins.

28. Indeed as regards the gospel, [they are] enemies for your sakes. But as regards the election, [they are] beloved for the fathers' sakes.

29. For the free gifts and calling of God [are] without repentance.

30. For as you also then disbelieved God, but now have been shown mercy through their disbelief,

31. even so these also have not believed now, so that through your mercy they may also obtain mercy.

32. For God has shut up all in unbelief, so that He might show mercy to all.

33. O [the] depth of [the] riches both of [the] wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable [are] His judgments, and His ways past finding out!

34. For who has known the mind of [the] Lord, or who became His counselor?

35. Or who first gave to Him, and it will be repaid to him?

36. For of Him and through Him and to Him [are] all things; to Him be glory forever! Amen.

## Romans 12

1. I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, pleasing to God, [which is] your reasonable service.

2. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, in order to prove by you what [is] that good and pleasing and perfect will of God.

3. For I say, through the grace given to me, to every one who is among you, not to think [of himself] more highly than he ought to think. But set your mind to be right-minded, even as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith.

4. For even as we have many members in one body, and all members do not have the same function,

5. so we the many are one body in Christ, and each one members of one another.

6. Then having gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, if prophecy, according to the proportion of faith;

7. or ministry, in the ministry; or [he who] teaches, in the teaching;

8. or he who exhorts, in the encouragement; or he who shares, in simplicity; or he who takes the lead, in diligence; or he who shows mercy, in cheerfulness.

9. [Let] love [be] without hypocrisy, shrinking from evil, cleaving to good;

10. in brotherly love to one another, loving fervently, having led one another in honor.

11. As to diligence, not slothful, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord;

12. rejoicing in hope, patient in affliction, steadfastly continuing in prayer,

13. distributing to the needs of the saints, pursuing hospitality.

14. Bless those who persecute you; bless, and do not curse.

15. Rejoice with rejoicing ones, and weep with weeping ones;

16. minding the same thing toward one another, not minding high things, but yielding to the lowly. Do not be wise within yourselves.

17. Repay no one evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.

18. If [it is] possible, as far as [is] in you, being in peace with all men.

19. not avenging yourselves, beloved, but giving place to wrath; for it is written, Vengeance [is] Mine, I will repay, says [the] Lord.

20. Therefore if your enemy hungers, feed him. If he thirsts, give him drink. For [in so] doing you shall heap coals of fire on his head.

21. Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

## Romans 13

1. Let every soul be subject to the higher authorities. For there is no authority but of God; the authorities that exist are ordained by God.

2. So that the one resisting the authority resists the ordinance of God; and the ones who resist will receive judgment to themselves.

3. For the rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the bad. And do you desire to be not afraid of the authority? Do the good, and you shall have praise from it.

4. For it is a servant of God to you for good. For if you practice evil, be afraid, for it does not bear the sword in vain; for it is a servant of God, a revenger for wrath on him who does evil.

5. Therefore [you] must be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake.

6. For because of this you also pay taxes. For they are God's servants, always giving attention to this very thing.

7. Therefore give to all [their] dues; to the [one due] tax, the tax; tribute to whom tribute [is due], fear to whom fear [is due], and honor to whom honor [is due].

8. Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves another has fulfilled the law.

9. For: Do not commit adultery; do not murder; do not steal; do not bear false witness; do not lust; and if [there is] any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.

10. Love works no ill to its neighbor, therefore love [is] the fulfilling of the law.

11. This also, knowing the time, that [it is] already time to awake out of sleep; for now our salvation [is] nearer than when we believed.

12. The night [is] far spent, the day is at hand; therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.

13. Let us walk becomingly, as in [the] day; not in carousings and drinking; not in co-habitation and lustful acts; not in strife and envy.

14. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not take thought beforehand for the lusts of the flesh.

## Romans 14

1. And receive him who is weak in the faith, [but] not to judgments of [your] thoughts.

2. For indeed one believes to eat all things; but being weak, [another] eats vegetables.

3. Do not let him who eats despise him who does not eat; and do not let him who does not eat judge him who eats, for God has received him.

4. Who are you that judges another's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. But he will stand, for God is able to make him stand.

5. One indeed esteems a day above [another] day; and [another] esteems every day [alike]. Let each one be fully assured in his own mind.

6. He who regards the day regards [it] to the Lord; and he not regarding the day, does not regard [it] to the Lord. He who eats, eats to [the] Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he who does not eat, does not eat to [the Lord, and gives God thanks.

7. For none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself.

8. For both if we live, we live to [the] Lord; and if we die, we die to [the] Lord. Therefore both if we live, and if we die, we are the Lord's.

9. For this Christ both died and rose and lived again, that He might be Lord both of [the] dead and living.

10. But why do you judge your brother? Or also why do you despise your brother? For all shall stand before the judgment seat of Christ.

11. For it is written,  As] I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God.

12. So then each one of us will give account concerning himself to God.

13. Then let us not judge one another any more, but rather judge this, not to put a stumbling-block or an offense toward his brother.

14. I know and am persuaded in [the] Lord Jesus, that nothing by itself [is] common; except to him who esteems anything to be common, [it is] common.

15. But if your brother is grieved with [your] food, you no longer walk according to love. Do not with your food destroy him for whom Christ died.

16. Then do not let your good be spoken evil of,

17. for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in [the] Holy Spirit.

18. For he who serves Christ in these things [is] well-pleasing to God, and approved by men.

19. So then let us pursue the things of peace, and the things for building up one another.

20. Do not undo the work of God for food. Truly, all things indeed [are] clean, but [it is] bad to the man eating because of a stumbling-block.

21. [It is] good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor [anything] by which your brother stumbles, or is offended, or is made weak.

22. Do you have faith? Have [it] to yourself before God. Blessed [is] he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.

23. But, the one doubting, if he eats, [he] has been condemned, because it is not of faith; and all that [is] not of faith is sin.

## Romans 15

1. Then we who are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.

2. Let every one of us please [his] neighbor for [his] good, to building up.

3. For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, The reproaches of those who reproached You fell on Me.

4. For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, so that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.

5. And may the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like minded toward one another according to Christ Jesus,

6. so that with one mind [and] one mouth you may glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

7. Therefore receive one another as Christ also received us, to [the] glory of God.

8. And I say, Jesus Christ has become a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises [made] to the fathers,

9. and that the nations might glorify God for [His] mercy, as it is written, For this cause I will confess to You in the nations, and I will praise Your name.

10. And again He says, Rejoice, O nations, with His people.

11. And again, Praise the Lord, all the nations, and praise Him, all the peoples.

12. And again Isaiah says, There shall be a root of Jesse, and He who shall rise to reign over the nations, in Him shall the nations trust.

13. And may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope through the power of [the] Holy Spirit.

14. And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brothers, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.

15. But, brothers, I wrote to you boldly, as reminding you in part, because of the grace that is given to me by God,

16. that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the nations, ministering the gospel of God, so that the offering up of the nations might be acceptable, being sanctified by [the] Holy Spirit.

17. Therefore I have boasting in Christ Jesus [as to] the things pertaining to God.

18. For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ did not work out by me for [the] obedience of the nations in word and deed,

19. in power of miracles and wonders, in power of [the] Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem, and all around to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.

20. Yea, so I have been eager to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build on another man's foundation;

21. but as it is written, To whom nothing was said about Him, they shall see. And they who have not heard shall understand.

22. For this cause I also have been greatly hindered from coming to you.

23. But now, having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you,

24. whenever I may go into Spain, I will come to you. For [in] traveling through I hope to see you, and to be set forward there by you, if first I may be filled of you in part.

25. But now I am going to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.

26. For it has pleased those of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints in Jerusalem.

27. Truly it has pleased them, and they are their debtors. For if the nations have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in fleshly things.

28. Therefore when I have completed this, and have sealed this fruit to them, I will come by you into Spain.

29. And I am sure that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of [the] blessing of the gospel of Christ.

30. But I exhort you, brothers, for the sake of the Lord Jesus Christ and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in [your] prayers to God for me,

31. that I may be delivered from those disbelieving in Judea, and that my service which [I have] for Jerusalem may be accepted by the saints;

32. so that [I may] come to you with joy by [the] will of God, and may be refreshed with you.

33. Now may the God of peace [be] with you all. Amen.

## Romans 16

1. I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church in Cenchrea,

2. that you receive her in [the] Lord, [as] becomes saints, and that you may assist her in whatever business she has need of you. For she has been a helper of many, and of myself also.

3. Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my helpers in Christ Jesus,

4. who have laid down their own necks for my life; to whom not only I give thanks, but also the churches of the nations.

5. Likewise [greet] the church that is in their house. Greet my beloved Epenetus, who is the first-fruits of Achaia to Christ.

6. Greet Mary, who bestowed much labor on us.

7. Greet Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.

8. Greet Amplias my beloved in [the] Lord.

9. Greet Urbanus, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.

10. Greet Apelles, approved in Christ. Greet those who are of Aristobulus' [household].

11. Greet Herodion my kinsman. Greet those who are of the [household] of Narcissus, who are in [the] Lord.

12. Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labor in [the] Lord. Greet the beloved Persis, who labored much in [the] Lord.

13. Greet Rufus, chosen in [the] Lord, and his mother and mine.

14. Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brothers with them.

15. Greet Philologus and Julias, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints with them.

16. Greet one another with a holy kiss. The churches of Christ greet you.

17. And I exhort you, brothers, to watch those making divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned, and avoid them.

18. For they who are such do not serve our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches [they] deceive the hearts of the simple.

19. For your obedience reached to all. Therefore I am glad on your behalf, But I would have you truly wise [as] to good, and simple toward evil.

20. And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you. Amen.

21. Timothy my fellow worker, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater my kinsmen, greet you.

22. I, Tertius, who wrote [this] epistle, greet you in [the] Lord.

23. Gaius my host, and the host of me and the whole church, greets you. Erastus the steward of the city greets you, and Quartus a brother.

24. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen.

25. Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of [the] mystery, having been unvoiced during eternal times;

26. but now has been made plain, and by the prophetic Scriptures, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith;

27. to God only wise [be] glory through Jesus Christ forever. Amen.
