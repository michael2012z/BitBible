# Obadiah

## Obadiah 1

1. The vision of Obadiah. So says the Lord God concerning Edom: We have heard a message from the LORD, and a messenger is sent among the nations: Rise up, even let us rise up against her for battle.

2. Behold, I have given you [to be] small among the nations; you are greatly despised.

3. The pride of your heart has deceived you, dwelling in the clefts of the rock, his dwelling [is] lofty; saying in his heart, Who shall bring me down [to] the ground?

4. Though you rise high like the eagle, and though [you] set your nest between the stars, I will bring you down from there, says the LORD.

5. If thieves came to you, if destroyers by night (how you have been cut off!), would they not have stolen until they had enough? If the grape-gatherers came to you, would they not leave gleanings?

6. How Esau is searched out! His hidden things are sought out!

7. All the men of your covenant have dismissed you to the border; the men who were at peace with you have deceived you, [and] have overcome you. They are setting your bread as a snare under you; [there is] no understanding in them.

8. Shall I not in that day even destroy the wise out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau, says the LORD?

9. And your mighty ones, O] Teman, shall be afraid, so that each man from the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.

10. Shame shall cover you from the violence against your brother Jacob, and you shall be cut off forever.

11. On the day of your standing on the other [side], on the day that the strangers were capturing his force, and foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, even you [were] like one of them.

12. But you should not have looked on the day of your brother on the day of his alienation; nor should you have rejoiced over the sons of Judah in the day of their ruin; nor should you have enlarged your mouth in the day of distress.

13. You should not have entered into the gate of My people in the day of their calamity; also, you should not have looked on his evil in the day of their calamity. Nor should you have sent out against his force in the day of his calamity.

14. Nor should you have stood on the crossways to cut off those of him who escaped; nor should you have shut up his survivors in the day of distress.

15. For the day of the LORD [is] near on all the nations; as you have done, it shall be done to you. Your reward shall return upon your head.

16. For as you have drunk upon My holy mountain, [so] all the nations shall drink forever. Yes, they shall drink, and they shall swallow, and they shall be as [though] they had not been.

17. But upon Mount Zion shall be those who escaped; and it shall be holy. And the house of Jacob shall possess their own possessions.

18. And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame. And the house of Esau [shall be] for stubble. And they shall kindle in them and burn them up. And no survivor shall be to the house of Esau; for the LORD has spoken it.

19. And [those of] the south shall possess the mountain of Esau and the low country of the Philistines. And they shall possess the fields of Ephraim and the fields of Samaria; and Benjamin [shall possess] Gilead.

20. And the exiles of this army [shall go] to the sons of Israel who shall possess [the land] of the Canaanites to Zarephath; even the exiles of Jerusalem who [are] in Sepharad shall possess the cities of the south.

21. And deliverers shall go up into the mountain of Zion to judge the mountain of Esau; and the kingdom shall be to the LORD.
