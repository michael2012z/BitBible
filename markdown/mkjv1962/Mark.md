# Mark

## Mark 1

1. The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, [the] Son of God:

2. as it is written in the Prophets, Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare Your way before You.

3. The voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of [the] Lord, make His paths straight.

4. John came baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.

5. And all the land of Judea, and those of Jerusalem, went out to him and were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.

6. And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a leather girdle about his loin. And he ate locusts and wild honey.

7. And he proclaimed, saying, There is One coming after me who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down to loosen.

8. I indeed have baptized you in water, but He shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit.

9. And it happened in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.

10. And immediately coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him.

11. And there came a voice from Heaven, [saying], You are My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

12. And immediately the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness.

13. And He was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan. And He was with the wild beasts, and the angels ministered to Him.

14. And after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom of God,

15. and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God draws near. Repent, and believe the gospel.

16. And walking along beside the sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.

17. And Jesus said to them, Come after Me and I will make you fishers of men.

18. And immediately they left their nets and followed Him.

19. And when He going farther from there a little, He saw James [the son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets.

20. And immediately He called them. And they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and went after Him.

21. And they went into Capernaum. And immediately on the sabbath day He entered into the synagogue and taught.

22. And they were astonished at His doctrine. For He taught them as one who had authority, and not like the scribes.

23. And in their synagogue was a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out,

24. saying, What [is] to us and to You, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know You, who You are, the Holy One of God.

25. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet, and come out of him.

26. And the unclean spirit, convulsing him, and crying with a loud voice, he came out of him.

27. They all were amazed, so as to question among themselves, saying, What is this? What new doctrine [is] this? For He even commands the unclean spirits with authority, and they obey Him.

28. And immediately His fame went out into all the Galilean neighborhood.

29. And immediately after they had come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.

30. But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and at once they told Him about her.

31. And He came and took her by the hand and lifted her up. And instantly the fever left her, and she served them.

32. And at evening, when the sun set, they brought all those who were diseased to Him, and those who had been demon-possessed.

33. And all the city had gathered at the door.

34. And He healed many who were sick of different diseases, and cast out many demons. And He did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew Him.

35. And rising up quite early in [the] night, He went out and went away into a deserted place, and [He] was praying there.

36. And Simon, and those with him, searched for Him.

37. And finding Him, they said to Him, All are seeking You.

38. And He said to them, Let us go into the next towns so that I may proclaim there also. For that reason I came forth.

39. And He proclaimed in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out demons.

40. And a leper came to Him, begging Him and kneeling down to Him, and saying to Him, If You will, You can make me clean.

41. And Jesus, moved with compassion, put out [His] hand and touched him, and said to him, I will; be clean!

42. And He having spoken, the leprosy instantly departed from him and he was cleansed.

43. And He strictly charged him and immediately sent him away,

44. and He said to him, See that you say nothing to anyone. But go and show yourself to the priest, and offer those things which Moses commanded for your cleansing, for a testimony to them.

45. But going out, he began to proclaim [it] very much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was outside in deserted places. And they came to Him from every quarter.

## Mark 2

1. And again He entered into Capernaum after [some] days. And it was heard that He was in [a] house.

2. And immediately many were gathered, so that none any longer had room, even to the door. And He proclaimed the Word to them.

3. Then they came to Him, bringing one [who was] paralyzed, who was carried by four.

4. When they could not come near to Him because of the crowd, they unroofed the roof where He was. And digging through, they let down the cot on which the paralytic was lying.

5. And seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, Child, your sins are forgiven to you.

6. But some of the scribes were sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,

7. Why does this one speak such blasphemies? Who can forgive sins except God only?

8. And instantly knowing in His spirit that they reasoned so within themselves, He said to them, Why do you reason these things in your heart?

9. Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, [Your] sins are forgiven you; or to say, Arise, and take up your cot and walk?

10. But so that you may know that the Son of man has authority upon earth to forgive sins, He said to the paralytic,

11. I say to you, Arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house.

12. And immediately he arose and took up his cot and went out before all. So that all were amazed and glorified God, saying, We never saw [it] this way.

13. And He went out again by the seaside. And all the crowd came to Him, and He taught them.

14. And as He passed on, He saw Levi [the son] of Alpheus sitting at the tax-office. And [He] said to him, Follow Me. And he arose and followed Him.

15. And it happened as Jesus reclined in his house, many tax-collectors and sinners also reclined with Jesus and His disciples. For there were many, and they followed Him.

16. And when the scribes and Pharisees saw Him eat with tax-collectors and sinners, [they] said to His disciples, How [is it] that He eats and drinks with tax-collectors and sinners?

17. When Jesus heard, He said to them, They who are strong have no need of a physician, but the ones who have illness. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

18. The disciples of John and those of the Pharisees were fasting. And they came and said to Him, Why do John's disciples and those of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?

19. And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.

20. But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast in those days.

21. And no one sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment, else [it] takes away from its fullness, the new [from] the old, and a worse tear occurs.

22. No one puts new wine into old wineskins, else the new wine bursts the wineskins, and the wine spills, and the wineskins will be ruined. The new wine must be put into new wineskins.

23. And it happened that He went through the grainfields on the sabbath day. And as they walked His disciples began to pluck the heads [of grain].

24. And the Pharisees said to Him, Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the sabbath day?

25. And He said to them, Have you never read what David did, when he had need and was hungry, he, and those with him?

26. How he went into the house of God in [the days of] Abiathar the high priest and ate the showbread, which it is not lawful to eat, except for the priests, and also gave to those with him?

27. And He said to them, The sabbath came into being for man's sake, and not man for the sabbath's sake.

28. Therefore the Son of man is also Lord of the sabbath.

## Mark 3

1. And He again entered into the synagogue. And a man was there who had a withered hand.

2. And they watched Him to see if He would heal him on the sabbath day, so that they might accuse Him.

3. And He said to the man who had the withered hand, Arise! Come into the middle.

4. And He said to them, [Is it] lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? To save life, or to kill? But they were silent.

5. And looking around on them with anger, being grieved because of the hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, Stretch out your hand! And he stretched [it] out. And his hand was restored whole, like the other.

6. The Pharisees went out and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against Him, how they might destroy Him.

7. And Jesus withdrew to the sea with His disciples. And a great crowd from Galilee followed Him, and from Judea,

8. and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and [from] beyond Jordan, and those around Tyre and Sidon, a great throng came to him, having heard how much He was doing.

9. And He spoke to His disciples, so that a small boat should stay near to Him, because of the crowd, lest they should press on Him.

10. For He had healed many, so that they pressed on Him in order to touch Him, as many as had plagues.

11. And unclean spirits, when they saw Him, [they] fell down before Him and cried, saying, You are the Son of God!

12. And He strictly charged them that they should not make Him known.

13. And He went up into a mountain and called near those whom He would. And they came to Him.

14. And He ordained twelve, that they should be with Him, and that He might send them out to proclaim,

15. and to have authority to heal sicknesses, and to cast out demons.

16. And He put on Simon [the] name Peter.

17. And He put on James [the son] of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, [the] names Boanerges, which is, the Sons of Thunder.

18. And [He appointed] Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James [the son] of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite,

19. and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. And they went into a house.

20. And again a crowd came together, so that they could not even eat bread.

21. And hearing, those with Him went out to take hold [of] Him; for they said, He is insane.

22. And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons.

23. And He called them and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?

24. And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.

25. And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.

26. And if Satan rises up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.

27. No one can enter into a strong one's house and plunder his goods, except he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house.

28. Truly I say to you, all sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and blasphemies with which they shall blaspheme.

29. But he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never shall have forgiveness, but is liable to eternal condemnation.

30. Because they said, He has an unclean spirit.

31. Then His brothers and His mother came. And standing outside, [they] sent to Him, calling Him.

32. And the crowd sat about Him, and they said to Him, Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are outside seeking for You.

33. And He answered them, saying, Who is My mother, or My brothers?

34. And He looked around on those who sat about Him, and said, Behold My mother and My brothers!

35. For whoever does the will of God, the same is My brother and My sister and My mother.

## Mark 4

1. And He began again to teach by the seaside. And there was a great crowd gathered to Him, so that He entered into a boat and sat in the sea. And the whole crowd was on the land by the seaside.

2. And He taught them many things by a parable. And He said to them in His teaching:

3. Listen! Behold, a sower went out to sow.

4. And as he sowed, it happened that indeed some fell by the wayside, and the fowls of the air came and ate it up.

5. And another fell on stony ground, where it did not have much earth. And it sprang up at once, due to not having deepness of earth.

6. And when [the] sun rose, it was scorched. And because it had no root, it withered away.

7. And another fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.

8. And another fell on good ground and yielded fruit, going up and increasing. And one bore thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundredfold.

9. And He said to them, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

10. And when He was alone, they who were about Him, with the Twelve, asked Him concerning the parable.

11. And He said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God. But to those outside, all [these] things are [given] in parables

12. so that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and [their] sins should be forgiven them.

13. And He said to them, Do you not know this parable? And how then will you know all parables?

14. The sower sows the Word.

15. And these are those by the wayside, where the Word is sown. And when they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the Word that was sown in their hearts.

16. And these are those likewise being sown on stony places; who, when they hear the Word, immediately receive it with gladness.

17. But they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Afterward when affliction or persecution arises for the Word's sake, they are immediately offended.

18. And these are those being sown among thorns; such as hear the Word,

19. and the cares of this world, and the deceit of riches, and the lust about other things entering in, choke the Word, and it becomes unfruitful.

20. And these are those sown on good ground, who hear the Word and welcome [it], and bear fruit, one thirty, one sixty, and one a hundredfold.

21. And He said to them, Does a lamp come to be put under a grain-measure, or under a bed? and not to be set on a lampstand?

22. For there is nothing hidden which shall not be revealed; nor became covered, but that it might come to the light.

23. If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.

24. And He said to them, Take heed what you hear. With that measure which you measure, it shall be measured to you. And to you who hear, more shall be given.

25. For he who has, [more] shall be given to him; and he who has not, from him shall be taken even that which he has.

26. And He said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;

27. and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knows not how.

28. For the earth brings out fruit of itself, first the blade, then the ear, after that the full grain in the ear.

29. But when the fruit has been brought out, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.

30. And He said, to what shall we compare the kingdom of God? Or by what parable shall we compare it?

31. [It is] like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth.

32. But when it has been sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all herbs, and shoots out great branches, so as to enable the birds of the air to roost under its shade.

33. And with many such parables He spoke the Word to them, as they were able to hear [it].

34. But he did not speak to them without a parable. And when [they were] alone, He explained all things to His disciples.

35. And evening having come, He said to them on that day, Let us pass over to the other side.

36. And when they had sent away the crowd, they took Him with them as He was in the boat. And there were also other little boats with Him.

37. And there arose a windstorm, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was now full.

38. And He was in the stern of the boat, asleep on a headrest. And they awakened Him and said to Him, Master, do You not care that we perish?

39. And He awakened and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace! Be still! And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.

40. And He said to them, Why are you so fearful? How [is it] that you have no faith?

41. And they feared exceedingly and said to one another, What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?

## Mark 5

1. And they came over to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarenes.

2. And when He had come out of the boat, immediately a man with unclean spirits met Him out of the tombs,

3. who had [his] dwelling among the tombs. And no one could bind him, no, not with chains

4. because he had often been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nor could anyone subdue him.

5. And always, night and day, he was in the mountains and in the tombs, crying and cutting himself with stones.

6. And when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshiped Him,

7. and cried with a loud voice, and said, What [is] to me and to You, Jesus, son of the Most High God? I adjure You by God not to torment me.

8. For He said to him, Come out of the man, unclean spirit!

9. And He asked him, What [is] your name? And he answered, saying, My name [is] Legion, for we are many.

10. And he begged Him very much that He would not send them outside the country.

11. And a great herd of pigs was feeding near the mountains.

12. And all the demons begged Him, saying, Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.

13. And immediately Jesus allowed them. And the unclean spirits went out and entered into the pigs. And the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea (they were about two thousand), and were choked in the sea.

14. And the ones who fed the pigs fled and told [it] in the city and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.

15. And they came to Jesus and saw him who had been demon-possessed, and had the legion, sitting and clothed and right-minded, the one who had the legion. And they were afraid.

16. And those who had seen told them how it happened to the one who had been demon-possessed, and about the pigs.

17. And they began to beg Him to leave their borders.

18. And when He had come into the boat, the [former] demoniac begged Him that he might be with Him.

19. However Jesus did not allow him, but said to him, Go home to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and has had mercy on you.

20. And he departed and began to proclaim in Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all marvelled.

21. And Jesus having crossed again by boat to the other side, a large crowd collected on Him. And He was near the sea.

22. And, behold, one of the synagogue rulers came, Jairus by name. And when he saw Him, [he] fell at His feet.

23. And he begged Him greatly, saying, My little daughter lies at the point of death. Come, lay Your hands on her, so that she may be healed, and she shall live.

24. And [Jesus] went with him. And many people followed Him and thronged Him.

25. And a certain woman who had had an issue of blood twelve years,

26. and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and had not been bettered any, but rather came to worse,

27. having heard about Jesus, she came in the press behind and touched His garment.

28. For she said, If I may but touch only His clothes, I will be cured.

29. And instantly the fountain of her blood dried up. And she felt in [her] body that she was healed of that plague.

30. And knowing instantly within Himself that power had gone out of Him, Jesus turned Himself around in the press and said, Who touched My clothes?

31. And His disciples said to Him, You see the crowd pressing on You, and do You say, Who touched Me?

32. And He looked around to see her who had done this thing.

33. But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done in her, came and fell down before Him and told Him all the truth.

34. And He said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be whole from your plague.

35. While He still spoke, they came from the synagogue ruler's house, saying, Your daughter is dead; why do you still trouble the Teacher?

36. But hearing the word spoken, Jesus said to the synagogue ruler, Do not be afraid, only believe.

37. And He allowed no one to follow Him, except Peter and James and John, the brother of James.

38. And He came to the synagogue ruler's and saw a tumult, and weeping and much wailing.

39. And going in He said to them, Why do you make a tumult and weep? The girl is not dead, but sleeps.

40. And they laughed at Him. But when He had put [them] all out, He took the father and the mother of the child, and those with Him, and went in where the child was lying.

41. And He took the child's hand and said to her, Talitha koumi; (which interpreted is, Little girl, I say to you, arise!)

42. And instantly the little girl arose and walked (for she was twelve years [old] ). And they were astonished with a great astonishment.

43. And He strictly warned them that no one should know this. And He said to give her something to eat.

## Mark 6

1. And He went out from there and came into His native-place. And His disciples followed Him.

2. And when the sabbath day had come, He began to teach in the synagogue. And many hearing [Him], were astonished, saying, Where does this one get these things? And what wisdom [is] this which is given to him, that even such mighty works are done by his hands?

3. Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at Him.

4. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his native-place, and among his own kin, and in his own house.

5. And He could do no work of power there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick ones, He healed [them].

6. And He marveled because of their unbelief. And He went around the villages, in [a] circuit, teaching.

7. And He called the Twelve and began to send them out by two and two. And He gave them authority over unclean spirits,

8. and commanded them that they take nothing in [the] way, except only a staff; no bag, no bread, no copper in the belt,

9. but tying on sandals, and not to put on two tunics.

10. And He said to them, Wherever you enter into a house, abide there until you depart from [that place].

11. And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when you depart from there, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Truly I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.

12. And they went out and proclaimed that [men] should repent.

13. And they cast out many demons, and anointed many who were sick with oil, and healed [them].

14. And king Herod heard [of Him] (for His name had become well-known,) and he said that John the Baptist had been raised from the dead, and therefore mighty works operate in him.

15. Others said [that it was] Elijah. And others said that he is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.

16. But hearing Herod said, It is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead!

17. For Herod himself had sent out and laid hold on John and had bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. For he had married her,

18. and John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.

19. And Herodias held it against him, and desired to kill him, but she could not.

20. For Herod feared John, knowing that [he was] a just and holy man. And he kept him safe. And when he heard him, he did many things and heard him gladly.

21. And a convenient day came, when Herod made a supper to great men on his birthday, and to the chiliarchs, and to the first ones of Galilee.

22. And when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced and pleased Herod, and those who reclined with [him], the king said to the girl, Ask me whatever you desire from me, and I will give [it] to you.

23. And he swore to her, Whatever you shall ask from me, I will give [it] to you, to the half of my kingdom.

24. And she went out and said to her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.

25. And immediately going in with haste to the king, she asked, saying, I desire that you give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.

26. And becoming deeply grieved, the king, because of his oath, and those reclining together, he did not wish to reject her.

27. And immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought. And he went and beheaded him in the prison,

28. and brought his head in a platter and gave it to the girl. And the girl gave it to her mother.

29. And when his disciples heard, they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb.

30. And the apostles gathered themselves to Jesus and told Him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught.

31. And He said to them, Come aside into a deserted place and rest a little. For there were many coming and going, and they had no opportunity even to eat.

32. And they departed by boat into a deserted place.

33. And the crowds saw them leaving, and many knew Him. And [they] ran together on foot there, out of the cities. And they went before them and came together to Him.

34. And going out Jesus saw a large crowd. And He was moved with compassion toward them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And He began to teach them many things.

35. And [it] now becoming a late hour, His disciples came to Him and said, This is a deserted place and [it is] now a late hour.

36. Send them away so that they may go to the surrounding fields and villages and buy loaves for themselves. For they have nothing to eat.

37. He answered and said to them, You give them [food] to eat. And they said to Him, Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii of loaves and give them to eat?

38. He said to them, How many loaves do you have? Go and see. And when they knew, they said, Five, and two fish.

39. And He commanded them all to recline, group [by] group, on the green grass.

40. And they reclined group [by] group, by hundred and by fifty.

41. And taking the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to Heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves, and gave [them] to His disciples to set before them. And He divided the two fish to all.

42. And they all ate and were filled.

43. And they took up twelve hand baskets full [of] fragments, also from the fish.

44. And those eating the loaves were about five thousand men.

45. And immediately He constrained His disciples to get into the boat and to go before to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He sent away the crowd.

46. And taking leave [of] them, He went away to the mountain to pray.

47. And when evening had come, the boat was in [the] middle of the sea, and He was alone on the land.

48. And He saw them toiling in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them. And about the fourth watch of the night He came toward them walking on the sea, and would have passed by them.

49. But when they saw Him walking on the sea, they supposed that it was a phantom, and cried out.

50. For they all saw Him and were troubled. And immediately He talked with them, and said, Be of good cheer. I AM! Do not be afraid.

51. And He went up into the boat to them. And the wind was cut off. And they were very much amazed within themselves beyond measure, and marveled.

52. For they did not understand [the miracle] of the loaves, for their hearts were hardened.

53. And crossing over, they came into the land of Gennesaret and drew to the shore.

54. And when they had come out of the boat, at once knowing Him,

55. they ran all around that neighborhood, and began to carry on cots those who were sick, wherever they heard He was.

56. And wherever He entered, into villages or cities or country, they laid the sick in the streets and begged Him if only they might touch but the fringe of His garment. And as many as touched Him were made whole.

## Mark 7

1. And the Pharisees and some of the scribes came together to Him, having come from Jerusalem.

2. And when they saw some of His disciples eating loaves with unclean hands, that is with unwashed hands, they found fault.

3. For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they immerse [their] hands with the fist, holding the tradition of the elders.

4. And coming from the market, they do not eat without immersing, and there are many other things which they have received to hold, the dippings of cups and pots, and of copper vessels, and of tables.

5. Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him, Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat loaves with unwashed hands?

6. But He answered and said to them, Well has Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honors Me with [their] lips, but their heart is far from Me.

7. However, they worship Me in vain, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men.

8. For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the dippings of pots and cups. And many other such things you do.

9. And He said to them, Do you do well to set aside the commandment of God, so that you may keep your own tradition?

10. For Moses said, Honor your father and your mother. And, Whoever curses father or mother, let him die the death.

11. But you say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, Corban! (that is, A gift [to God], whatever you may profit by me)

12. and you no longer allow him to do anything toward [his] father or mother,

13. making the word of God of no effect through your tradition which you have delivered. And you do many such things.

14. And calling near all the crowd, He said to them, Listen to Me, every one of you, and understand.

15. There is nothing from outside a man which entering into him can defile [him]. But the things which come out of him, those are the ones that defile the man.

16. If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.

17. And when He had entered into the house away from the crowd, His disciples asked Him concerning the parable.

18. And He said to them, Are you also without understanding? Do you not perceive that whatever enters into the man from outside cannot defile him,

19. because it does not enter into his heart, but into the belly, and goes out into the waste-bowl, purifying all food?

20. And He said, That which comes out of the man is what defiles the man.

21. For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,

22. thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:

23. All these evil things pass out from inside and defile the man.

24. And He arose from there and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And He entered into a house and desired no one to know [it]. But He could not be hidden.

25. For a woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of Him and came and fell at His feet.

26. The woman was a Greek, a Syro-phoenician by race. And she begged Him that He would cast the demon out of her daughter.

27. But Jesus said to her, Let the children first be filled. For it is not right to take the children's loaves and to throw [it] to the dogs.

28. And she answered and said to Him, Yes, Lord, yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.

29. And He said to her, For this saying go, the demon has gone out of your daughter.

30. And when she had come to her house, she found the demon had gone out, and her daughter lay on the couch.

31. And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, He came to the Sea of Galilee, in the midst of the borders of the Decapolis.

32. And they brought a deaf one to Him, hardly speaking. And they begged Him to put [His] hand on him.

33. And He took him aside from the crowd and put His fingers into his ears. And He spat and touched his tongue.

34. And looking up to Heaven, He sighed and said to him, Ephphatha! (that is, Be opened!)

35. And instantly his ears were opened and the bond of his tongue was loosened, and he spoke plainly.

36. And He commanded them, that they should tell no one. But the more He commanded them, so much the more they proclaimed [it].

37. And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, He has done all things well. He makes both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak.

## Mark 8

1. In those days, the crowd being very great and having nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples and said to them,

2. I have compassion on the crowd because they have now been with Me three days and have nothing to eat.

3. And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint in the way. For many of them come from afar.

4. And His disciples answered Him, From where can a man satisfy these [with] loaves here in the wilderness?

5. And He asked them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven.

6. And He commanded the people to recline on the ground. And He took the seven loaves and gave thanks, and He broke and gave to His disciples to set before them. And they set [them before] the people.

7. And they had a few fish. And He blessed and commanded them to also serve these.

8. So they ate and were filled. And [they] took up over and above seven lunch baskets [of] fragments.

9. And they who had eaten were about four thousand. And He sent them away.

10. And immediately He entered into a boat with His disciples and came into the region of Dalmanutha.

11. And the Pharisees came out and began to dispute with Him, seeking a sign from Heaven from Him, tempting Him.

12. And He sighed deeply in His spirit and said, Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say to you, [There shall no] sign be given to this generation.

13. And He left them. And entering into the boat again, He departed to the other side.

14. And [the disciples] had forgotten to take loaves, and they did not have more than one loaf in the boat with them.

15. And He charged them, saying, Take heed! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and [of] the leaven of Herod.

16. And they reasoned among themselves, saying, [It is] because we have no loaves.

17. And knowing [it], Jesus said to them, Why do you reason [that it is] because you have no loaves? Do you not yet perceive nor understand? Have you still hardened your heart?

18. Do you have eyes and do not see? Do you have ears and do not hear? And do you not remember?

19. When I broke the five loaves among five thousand, how many hand baskets full of fragments did you take up? They said to Him, Twelve.

20. And when the seven among four thousand, how many lunch baskets full of fragments did you take up? And they said, Seven.

21. And He said to them, How do you not understand?

22. And He came to Bethsaida. And they brought a blind man to Him and begged Him to touch him.

23. And He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town. And when He had spat on his eyes and had put [His] hands on him, He asked Him if he saw anything.

24. And he looked up and said, I see men as trees, walking.

25. And after that He put [His] hands again on his eyes and made him look up. And he was restored and saw all clearly.

26. And He sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell [it] to any in the town.

27. And Jesus and His disciples went out into the towns of Caesarea Philippi. And in the way He asked His disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?

28. And they answered, John the Baptist. But others [say] Elijah, and others say one of the prophets.

29. And He said to them, But who do you say that I am? And Peter answered and said to Him, You are the Christ.

30. And He charged them that they should tell no one of Him.

31. And He began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.

32. And He spoke that saying openly. And Peter took Him and began to rebuke Him.

33. But when He had turned around and looked on His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, Go behind Me, Satan! For you do not mind the things of God, but of the things of men.

34. And calling near the crowd with His disciples, He said to them, Whoever will come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.

35. For whoever will save his life shall lose it; but whoever shall lose his life for My sake and the gospel's, he shall save it.

36. For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?

37. Or what shall a man give in exchange [for] his soul?

38. Therefore whoever shall be ashamed of Me and of My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man shall also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.

## Mark 9

1. And He said to them, Truly I say to you that there are some of those who stand here who shall not taste of death until they see the kingdom of God come with power.

2. And after six days Jesus took Peter and James and John and led them up into a high mountain, apart by themselves. And He was transfigured before them.

3. And His clothing became shining, exceedingly white as snow such as no fuller on earth could whiten them.

4. And Elijah with Moses was seen by them, and they were talking with Jesus.

5. And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good [for] us to be here. And let us make three tabernacles, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.

6. For he did not know what to say, for they were very much afraid.

7. And there was a cloud that overshadowed them. And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son. Hear Him.

8. And suddenly, looking around, they did not see anyone any more, except Jesus alone with themselves.

9. And as they came down from the mountain, He commanded them that they should tell no one the things that they had seen until the Son of man had risen from [the] dead.

10. And they kept that saying within themselves, debating with one another what the rising from [the] dead [is].

11. And they asked Him, saying, Why do the scribes say that Elijah must first come?

12. And He answered and told them, Elijah truly does come first and restores all things. And how has it been written of the Son of man that He should suffer many things and be despised?

13. But I say to you that Elijah has indeed come, and they have done to him whatever they desired, as it is written of him.

14. And coming to [His] disciples, He saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them.

15. And immediately all the crowd, seeing Him, were greatly amazed, and they were running to [Him] to greet Him.

16. And He asked the scribes, What are you discussing with them?

17. And one of the crowd answered and said, Teacher, I have brought my son who has a dumb spirit to You.

18. And wherever he seizes him, he dashes him. And he foams and gnashes his teeth and pines away. And I spoke to Your disciples that they should cast him out, and they could not.

19. He answered him and said, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to Me!

20. And they brought him to Him. And when he saw Him, the spirit immediately convulsed him. And he fell on the ground and wallowed, foaming.

21. And He asked his father, How long ago has it been since this came to him? And he said, From childhood.

22. And oftentimes it has cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him. But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.

23. Jesus said to him, If you can believe, all things [are] possible to him who believes.

24. And immediately the father of the child cried out and said with tears, Lord, I believe. Help my unbelief.

25. And seeing that a crowd is running together, Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, Dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and enter no more into him!

26. And [the spirit] cried out, throwing him into convulsions, and came out of him. And he was like one dead, so that many said, He is dead.

27. But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.

28. And He entering into a house, His disciples asked Him privately, [Why] could we not cast him out?

29. And He said to them, This kind can come out by nothing except by prayer and fasting.

30. And going out from there, they passed through Galilee. And He desired that no one should know.

31. For He taught His disciples and said to them, The Son of man is delivered into [the] hands of men, and they shall kill him. And after He is killed, He shall rise the third day.

32. But they did not understand that saying and were afraid to ask Him.

33. And He came to Capernaum. And being in the house, He asked them, What was it that you disputed among yourselves in the way?

34. But they were silent. For in the way they had disputed among themselves who [was] the greatest.

35. And He sat down and called the Twelve and said to them, If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all.

36. And He took a child, and embraced it, and set him in their midst. And He said to them,

37. Whoever receives one of such children on My name receives Me. And whoever receives Me does not [only] receives Me, but Him who sent Me.

38. And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out demons in Your name, and he does not follow us. And we forbade him, because he does not follow us.

39. But Jesus said, Do not forbid him. For there is no one who shall do a work of power in My name who can lightly speak evil of Me.

40. For he who is not against us is for us.

41. For whoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in My name, because you [belong] to Christ, truly I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.

42. And whoever shall offend one of [these] little ones who believe in Me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged around his neck and he were cast into the sea.

43. And if your hand offends you, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than to have two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched

44. where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.

45. And if your foot offends you, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame than to have two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched

46. where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.

47. And if your eye offends you, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes to be cast into hell fire

48. where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.

49. For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.

50. Salt [is] good; but if the salt becomes saltless, with what will you season? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.

## Mark 10

1. And He arose from there. And He came into the borders of Judea by the other side of the Jordan. And again a crowd came together to Him. And as was His custom, He taught them again.

2. And tempting Him, the Pharisees came to Him and asked Him, Is it lawful for a man to put away [his] wife?

3. And He answered and said to them, What did Moses command you?

4. And they said, Moses allowed a bill of divorce to be written, and to put [her] away.

5. And Jesus answered and said to them, He wrote you this precept because of the hardness of your hearts.

6. But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.

7. For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife.

8. And the two of them shall be one flesh. So then they are no longer two, but one flesh.

9. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man put apart.

10. And in the house His disciples asked Him again about the same.

11. And He said to them, Whoever shall put away his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.

12. And if a woman shall put away her husband and marries to another, she commits adultery.

13. And they brought children to Him, so that He should touch them. And [His] disciples rebuked those bringing [them].

14. But when Jesus saw, He was much displeased and said to them, Allow the little children to come to Me and do not hinder [them]. For of such is the kingdom of God.

15. Truly I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter into it.

16. And taking them up in [His] arms, He put [His] hands on them and blessed them.

17. And when He had gone out into the way, one came running up and kneeled to Him, and asked Him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?

18. And Jesus said to him, Why do you call Me good? No one [is] good except one, God.

19. You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not defraud, honor your father and your mother.

20. And he answered and said to Him, Teacher, all these I have observed from my youth.

21. Then Jesus, beholding him, loved him and said to him, One [thing] you lack. Go, sell whatever you have and give it to the poor, and you shall have treasure in Heaven. And come, take up the cross and follow Me.

22. And he was sad at that saying and went away grieved, for he had great possessions.

23. And Jesus looked around and said to His disciples, How hardly those having riches will enter into the kingdom of God!

24. And the disciples were astonished at His words. But Jesus answering again said to them, Children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!

25. It is easier [for] a camel to go through the eye of a needle than [for] a rich one to enter into the kingdom of God.

26. And they were astonished beyond measure, saying to themselves, And who can be saved?

27. And Jesus looking on them said, With men [it is] impossible, but not with God; for with God all things are possible.

28. Then Peter began to say to Him, Lo, we have left all and have followed You.

29. And Jesus answered and said, Truly I say to you, There is no man that has left house or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospel's sake,

30. but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions, and in the world to come, eternal life.

31. But many [that are] first shall be last; and the last [shall be] first.

32. And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem. And Jesus went before them. And they were amazed, and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took the Twelve again and began to tell them what would happen to Him,

33. [saying], Behold, we go up to Jerusalem. And the Son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes. And they will condemn Him to death and will deliver Him to the nations.

34. And they will mock Him, and will scourge Him, and will spit on Him, and will kill Him. And the third day He shall rise again.

35. And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to Him, saying, Master, we desire that You should do for us whatever we shall ask.

36. And He said to them, What do you desire that I should do for you?

37. They said to Him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on Your left hand, in Your glory.

38. But Jesus said to them, You do not know what you ask. Can you drink of the cup that I drink of, and be baptized [with] the baptism that I am baptized [with] ?

39. And they said to Him, We can. And Jesus said to them, You shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of, and [with] the baptism that I am baptized [with] you shall be baptized.

40. But to sit on My right [hand] and on My left is not Mine to give, but [to those] for whom it is prepared.

41. And when the ten heard, they began to be indignant with James and John.

42. But Jesus called them and said to them, You know that they who are accounted rulers over the nations exercise lordship over them. And their great ones exercise authority on them.

43. But it shall not be so among you. But whoever desires to be great among you, let him be your servant.

44. And whoever of you desires to become first, [he] shall be servant of all.

45. For even the Son of man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life [as] a ransom for many.

46. And they came to Jericho. And as He with His disciples and a large crowd went out of Jericho, blind Bartimeus, the son of Timeus, was sitting by the side of the highway, begging.

47. And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me!

48. And many warned him that he should be quiet, but he cried a great deal more, Son of David, have mercy on me!

49. And Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called. And they called the blind [man], saying to him, Be of good comfort; rise up, He is calling you.

50. And casting away his garment, he rose up and came to Jesus.

51. And answering Jesus said to him, What do you desire that I should do to you? The blind [man] said to Him, My Lord, that I may see again.

52. And Jesus said to him, Go, your faith has healed you. And instantly he saw again, and he followed Jesus in the way.

## Mark 11

1. And when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, He sent out two of His disciples.

2. And He said to them, Go into the village over across from you. And as soon as you have entered into it, you will find a colt tied, on which no one of men has ever sat. Untie it and bring [it].

3. And if anyone says to you, Why do you do this? Say that the Lord has need of him, and immediately he will send him here.

4. And they went, and they found the colt tied by the door outside, in a place where two ways met. And they untied him.

5. And certain of those who stood there said to them, What are you doing, untying the colt?

6. And they said to them even as Jesus had commanded. And they let them go.

7. And they brought the colt to Jesus, and they threw their garments on it. And He sat on it.

8. And many spread their garments in the way, and others cut down branches off the trees and scattered [them] in the way.

9. And those going before, and those following, cried out, saying, Hosanna! Blessed [is] He who comes in [the] name of [the] Lord!

10. Blessed [is] the kingdom of our father David, who comes in [the] name of [the] Lord! Hosanna in the highest!

11. And Jesus entered into Jerusalem and into the temple. And when He had looked around on all things, the hour already being late, He went out to Bethany with the Twelve.

12. And on the next day, they going out of Bethany, He was hungry.

13. And seeing a fig-tree with leaves afar off, He went [to it], if perhaps He might find anything on it. And when He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not [the] season of figs.

14. And Jesus answered and said to it, No one shall eat fruit of you forever. And His disciples heard.

15. And they came to Jerusalem. And entering into the temple, Jesus began to cast out those who bought and sold in the temple. And He overthrew the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold doves.

16. And [He] would not allow any to carry a vessel through the temple.

17. And [He] taught, saying to them, Is it not written, My house shall be called the house of prayer for all nations? But you have made it a den of thieves.

18. And the scribes and the chief priests heard. And they sought how they might destroy Him. For they feared Him, because all the people were astonished at His doctrine.

19. And when evening came, He went out of the city.

20. And passing on early, they saw the fig-tree dried up from [the] roots.

21. And Peter, remembering, said to Him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which You cursed has withered away.

22. And answering Jesus said to them, Have faith of God.

23. For truly I say to you that whoever shall say to this mountain, Be moved and be cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he said shall occur, he shall have whatever he said.

24. Therefore I say to you, All things, whatever you ask, praying, believe that you shall receive [them], and it will be to you.

25. And when you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive [it] so that also your Father in Heaven may forgive you your trespasses.

26. But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in Heaven forgive your trespasses.

27. And they came again to Jerusalem. And as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to Him

28. and said to Him, By what authority do you do these things? And who gave you this authority to do these things?

29. And Jesus answered and said to them, I will also ask of you one thing, and answer Me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.

30. The baptism of John, was [it] from Heaven, or from men? Answer Me.

31. And they reasoned within themselves, saying, If we shall say, From Heaven, he will say, Why then did you not believe him?

32. But if we shall say, From men, they feared the people, for all held John to be a prophet indeed.

33. And they answered and said to Jesus, We cannot tell. And answering Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

## Mark 12

1. And He began to speak to them by parables. A man planted a vineyard, and set a fence about [it], and dug a wine-vat, and built a tower, and [he] let it out to vinedressers, and went away.

2. And at the season he sent a servant to the vinedressers, so that he might receive from the vinedressers the fruit of the vineyard.

3. And taking [him], they beat him and sent [him] away empty.

4. And again he sent to them another servant. And stoning that one, they struck [him] in the head, and sent [him] away, insulting him.

5. And again he sent another. And they killed him, and many others, beating some and killing some.

6. Therefore, still having one son, his own beloved, he also sent him to them last of all, saying, They will respect my son.

7. But those vinedressers said among themselves, This is the heir! Come, let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours.

8. And they took him and killed [him] and cast [him] out of the vineyard.

9. Therefore what will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the vinedressers and will give the vineyard to others.

10. And have you not read this scripture  The] Stone which the builders rejected has become the Head of [the] corner:

11. this was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes?

12. And they sought to seize him, but feared the crowd. For they knew that He spoke the parable against them. And leaving Him, they went away.

13. And they sent certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to Him, to catch Him in [His] words.

14. And coming, they said to Him, Teacher, we know that you are true and you care about no one. For you do not look to [the] face of men, but teach the way of God [in] truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?

15. Shall we give, or shall we not give? But knowing their hypocrisy, He said to them, Why do you tempt Me? Bring me a denarius so that I may see.

16. And they brought [it]. And He said to them, Whose image and inscription is this? And they said to Him, Caesar's.

17. And answering Jesus said to them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at Him.

18. Then the Sadducees came to Him, who say there is no resurrection. And they asked Him, saying,

19. Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If a man's brother die and leaves [his] wife, and leaves no children, his brother should take his wife and raise up seed to his brother.

20. And there were seven brothers. And the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.

21. And the second took her, and died; neither did he leave any seed. And the third likewise.

22. And the seven had her, and left no seed. Last of all the woman also died.

23. In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as a wife.

24. And answering Jesus said to them, Do you not err because of this, not knowing Scriptures, nor the power of God?

25. For when they shall rise from [the] dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but they are as the angels in Heaven.

26. And as regards the dead, that they rise, have you not read in the book of Moses how God spoke to him in the Bush, saying, I [am] the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?

27. He is not the God of [the] dead, but the God of [the] living. Therefore you greatly err.

28. And coming up one of the scribes heard them reasoning, knowing that He had answered them well, he asked Him, Which is [the] first commandment of all?

29. And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments [is], Hear, O Israel, [the] Lord our God is one Lord;

30. and you shall love [the] Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength. This [is] the first commandment.

31. And [the] second [is] like this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.

32. And the scribe said to Him, Right, Teacher, according to truth You have spoken, that God is one, and there is no other besides Him.

33. And to love Him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love the neighbor as himself, is more than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices.

34. And seeing that he had answered intelligently, Jesus said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And no one dared to question Him any more.

35. And answering, teaching in the temple, Jesus said, How do the scribes say that Christ is the Son of David?

36. For David himself said by the Holy Spirit: The LORD said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I place Your enemies as Your footstool.

37. David therefore himself calls Him Lord, and why [then] is He his son? And the great crowd heard Him gladly.

38. And He said to them in His teaching, Beware of the scribes, who love to walk about in robes, and [love] greetings in the markets,

39. and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost places at feasts

40. who devour widows' houses, and as a pretense make long prayers. These shall receive greater condemnation.

41. And sitting down opposite the treasury, Jesus watched how the people threw copper coins into the treasury. And many rich ones threw in much.

42. And a certain poor widow came, and she threw in two lepta, which is a kodrantes.

43. And He called His disciples and said to them, Truly I say to you that this poor widow has cast [in] more than all those who have cast into the treasury.

44. For all cast in from their abundance. But she, out of her poverty, has cast [in] all that she had, all her livelihood.

## Mark 13

1. And as He went out of the temple, one of His disciples said to Him, Master, see! What stones and what buildings!

2. And answering Jesus said to him, Do you see these great buildings? There shall not be one stone left on another that shall not be thrown down.

3. And [as] He sat on the Mount of Olives, across from the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him privately,

4. Tell us, When shall all these things be? And what [shall be] the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?

5. And Jesus answering them began to say, Beware that no one deceive you.

6. For many shall come in My name, saying, I AM, and shall deceive many.

7. And when you shall hear [of] wars and rumors of wars, do not be troubled. For it must happen, but the end [shall] not [be] yet.

8. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there shall be earthquakes in different places, and there shall be famines and troubles. These things [are] the beginnings of sorrows.

9. But take heed to yourselves. For they shall deliver you up to sanhedrins, and in the synagogues you shall be beaten. And you shall be brought before rulers and kings for My sake, for a testimony against them.

10. And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all nations.

11. But whenever they lead [you] away and deliver [you] up, take no thought beforehand what you should speak or think. But speak whatever shall be given to you in that hour. For it is not you who speaks, but the Holy Spirit.

12. And a brother will betray a brother to death, and a father his son. And children will rise up against [their] parents and will cause them to be put to death.

13. And you will be hated by all for My name's sake, but he enduring to the end, that [one] will be kept safe.

14. But when you see the abomination of desolation, that spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not (let him who reads understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.

15. And let him who is on the housetop not go down into the house, nor enter to take anything out of his house.

16. And let him who is in the field not turn back again in order to take up his garment.

17. But woe to those with [babe] in womb, and to those who give suck in those days!

18. And pray that your flight is not in the winter.

19. For [in] those days shall be affliction, such as has not been from [the] beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never [shall] be.

20. And unless the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh would be saved. But for the elect's sake, whom He has chosen, He has shortened the days.

21. And then if anyone shall say to you, Lo, here [is] Christ! Or, lo, there! Do not believe him.

22. For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will give miraculous] signs and wonders in order to seduce, if possible, even the elect.

23. But take heed; behold, I have told you all things beforehand.

24. But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,

25. and the stars of Heaven shall fall, and the powers in the heavens shall be shaken.

26. And then they will see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.

27. And then He shall send His angels and shall gather His elect from the four winds, from [the] end of [the] earth to [the] end of heaven.

28. And learn the parable of the fig-tree: when her branch is still tender and puts out leaves, you know that summer is near.

29. So you also, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, at [the] doors.

30. Truly I say to you that this generation shall not pass away until all these things occur.

31. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away.

32. But of that day and hour no one knows, no, not the angels in Heaven, nor the Son, but the Father.

33. Take heed, watch and pray, for you do not know when the time is.

34. As a man going away, leaving his house, and giving authority to his servants, and each man's work to him, and commanded the doorkeeper to watch.

35. Then you watch, for you do not know when the lord of the house is coming, [at] evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrowing, or early;

36. lest he come suddenly [and] find you sleeping.

37. And what I say to you, I say to all. Watch.

## Mark 14

1. And after two days it was the Passover and [the Feast of] Unleavened [Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take Him by craft and kill [Him.

2. But they said, Not during the Feast, lest there be an uproar of the people.

3. And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as He reclined, a woman came with an alabaster vial of pure, costly ointment of spikenard. And she broke the vial and poured [it] on His head.

4. And some were indignant to themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?

5. For it might have been sold [for] more than three hundred denarii, and be given to the poor. And they were incensed with her.

6. And Jesus said, Let her alone! Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work towards Me.

7. For you have the poor with you always, and whenever you desire you may do them good. But you do not have Me always.

8. She has done what she could. She has come beforehand to anoint My body for the burying.

9. Truly I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be proclaimed in all the world, [this] also that she has done will be spoken of for a memorial of her.

10. And Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray Him to them.

11. And when they heard, they were glad and promised to give him silver. And he sought how he might conveniently betray Him.

12. And the first day of Unleavened [Bread], when they killed the passover, His disciples said to Him, Where do You desire that we go and prepare that You may eat the passover?

13. And He sent out two of His disciples and said to them, Go into the city, and there you shall meet a man bearing a pitcher of water. Follow him.

14. And wherever he may go in, you say to the housemaster, The Teacher says, Where is the guest room where I shall eat the passover with My disciples?

15. And he will show you a large upper room, furnished [and] prepared. Prepare there for us.

16. And His disciples went out and came into the city and found [it] as He had said to them. And they made the passover ready.

17. And in the evening He came with the Twelve.

18. And as they reclined and ate, Jesus said, Truly I say to you, One of you will betray Me, the [one] eating with Me.

19. And they began to be grieved, and to say to Him one by one, Not at all I, [is it]? And another said, Not at all I, [is it] ?

20. And answering He said to them, [It is] one of the Twelve, the [one] dipping with Me in the dish.

21. The Son of man indeed goes, as it has been written of Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It were good for that man if he had never been born.

22. And [as] they ate, Jesus took a loaf and blessed and broke [it], and He gave to them and said, Take, eat; this is My body.

23. And taking the cup, giving thanks, He gave to them. And they all drank out of it.

24. And He said to them, This is My blood of the New Covenant, which is poured out for many.

25. Truly I say to you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.

26. And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

27. And Jesus said to them, All of you will be offended because of Me this night. For it is written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.

28. But after I am raised, I will go before you into Galilee.

29. But Peter said to Him, Although all shall be offended, yet I [will] not.

30. And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you that today, in this night, before the cock crows twice, you shall deny Me three times.

31. But he spoke the more fervently, If I should die with You, I will not deny You in any way. Also they all said likewise.

32. And they came to a place named Gethsemane. And He said to His disciples, Sit here while I pray.

33. And He took with Him Peter and James and John. And He began to be greatly amazed, and to be very heavy.

34. And He said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful to death. Stay here and watch.

35. And He went forward a little and fell on the ground. And He prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from Him.

36. And He said, Abba, Father, all things [are] possible to You. Take away this cup from Me. Yet not what I will, but what You [will].

37. And He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, Simon, do you sleep? Could you not watch one hour?

38. Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. Truly the spirit [is] willing, but the flesh [is] weak.

39. And again He went away and prayed and spoke the same words.

40. And when He returned, He found them asleep again (for their eyes were heavy), neither did they know what to answer Him.

41. And He came the third time and said to them, Sleep on now and take [your] rest. It is enough, the hour has come. Behold, the Son of man has been betrayed into the hands of sinners.

42. Rise up, let us go. Lo, he who betrays Me is at hand.

43. And immediately, while He still spoke, Judas, being one of the Twelve, came, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.

44. And he who betrayed Him had given them a sign, saying, Whomever I shall kiss, [it] is He. Take Him and lead [Him] away safely.

45. And coming, at once drawing near to Him, he said, Rabbi, Rabbi! And [he] ardently kissed Him.

46. And they laid their hands on Him and seized Him.

47. And one of those standing by, drawing a sword, struck a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.

48. And answering Jesus said to them, Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber, to take Me?

49. I was with you daily in the temple teaching, and you did not seize Me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.

50. And leaving Him, all fled.

51. And one, a certain young man, followed Him, having thrown a linen cloth around [his] naked [body]. And the young men caught him.

52. And he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked.

53. And they led Jesus away to the high priest. And with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.

54. And Peter followed Him from a distance to the inside of the court of the high priest. And he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the fire.

55. And the chief priests and all the sanhedrin sought for witness against Jesus, to put Him to death. And [they] found none.

56. For many testified falsely against Him, but the testimonies were not identical.

57. And certain ones rose up and bore false witness against Him, saying,

58. We heard Him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.

59. But neither was their testimony identical.

60. And standing up in the middle, the high priest questioned Jesus, saying, Do you answer nothing? What [do] these witness against you?

61. But He was silent and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked Him, saying to Him, Are you the Christ, the son of the Blessed?

62. And Jesus said, I AM! And you will see the Son of man sitting on the right [hand] of power and coming in the clouds of the heaven.

63. Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, What further need do we have of witnesses?

64. You have heard the blasphemy; what do you think? And they all condemned Him to be guilty of death.

65. And some began to spit on Him, and to cover His face and to beat Him, and to say to Him, Prophesy! And the under-officers struck Him with slaps.

66. And as Peter was below in the palace, one of the servant women of the high priest came.

67. And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked on him and said, And you also were with Jesus the Nazarene.

68. But he denied, saying, I do not know nor even understand what you are saying. And he went out into the forecourt. And a cock crowed.

69. And a servant woman saw him again and began to say to those who stood by, This [one] is of them.

70. And he denied it again. And a little after, those who stood by said again to Peter, Surely you are [one] of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech agrees.

71. But he began to curse and to swear, [saying], I do not know this man of whom you speak.

72. And the second time a cock crowed. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus said to him, Before a cock crows twice, you will deny Me three times. And thinking on [it], he wept.

## Mark 15

1. And immediately in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council. And they bound Jesus and led [Him] away and delivered [Him] to Pilate.

2. And Pilate asked Him, Are you the king of the Jews? And answering He said to him, You say [it].

3. And the chief priests accused Him [of] many things, but He answered nothing.

4. And Pilate asked Him again, saying, Do you answer nothing? Behold how many things they witness against you!

5. But Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate marveled.

6. And at [that] feast he released to them one prisoner, whomever they desired.

7. And there was [one] named Barabbas, bound with the insurgents, who had committed murder in the insurrection.

8. And the crowd, crying aloud, began to beg [him to do] as he had always done to them.

9. But Pilate answered them, saying, Do you desire that I release to you the King of the Jews?

10. For he knew that the chief priests had delivered Him because of envy.

11. But the chief priests moved the people that he should rather release Barabbas to them.

12. And Pilate answered and said again to them, What then do you desire that I should do [to him] whom you call the King of the Jews?

13. And they cried out again, Crucify him!

14. Then Pilate said to them, Why? What evil has he done? And they much more cried out, Crucify him!

15. And deciding to do the easiest [to] the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them, and having scourged [Him], delivered up Jesus to be crucified.

16. And the soldiers led Him away inside the court, which is [the] praetorium. And they called together all the cohort.

17. And they clothed Him with purple and plaited a crown of thorns and put it around His [head].

18. And they began to salute Him, Hail, King of the Jews!

19. And they struck Him on the head with a reed, and spat on Him, and placing the knees, [they] bowed to Him.

20. And when they had mocked Him, they took the purple off Him and put His own clothes on Him and led Him out to crucify Him.

21. And they made one who was passing by, Simon a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear His cross.

22. And they brought Him to Golgotha Place (which translated is, Place of a Skull).

23. And they gave Him wine mixed with myrrh to drink. But He did not take [it].

24. And when they had crucified Him, they divided His garments, casting lots on them, as, to what [each] should take.

25. And it was [the] third hour, and they crucified Him.

26. And the inscription of His accusation was written over [Him], THE KING OF THE JEWS.

27. And with Him they crucified two thieves, the one off [the] right, and one off [the] left.

28. And the Scripture was fulfilled which said, And he was numbered with [the] lawless.

29. And those who passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, Aha! You [razing] the temple and building [it] in three days,

30. save yourself and come down from the cross!

31. And also the chief priests mocking, with the scribes, said to one another, He saved others but he cannot save himself.

32. Let Christ the King of Israel now come down from the cross, so that we may see and believe. And they who were crucified with Him insulted Him.

33. And [it] being [the] sixth hour, darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour.

34. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? (which being translated is, My God, My God, why did You forsake Me?)

35. And hearing, some of those standing by said, Behold, he calls Elijah.

36. And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar and put [it] on a reed and gave [it] to him to drink. [But they said], Let alone, let us see if Elijah comes to take him down.

37. And letting out a loud voice, Jesus expired.

38. And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.

39. And when the centurion, who stood across from him, saw that He cried out so, [and] expired, he said, Truly this man was Son of God.

40. And also women were watching from a distance, among whom also was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less, and of Joses, and Salome,

41. (who also, when He was in Galilee, followed Him and ministered to Him), and many [other] women who came up with Him to Jerusalem.

42. And it, becoming evening already, since it was [the] Preparation, that is, [the] day before sabbath,

43. Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable counsellor, who also waited for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.

44. And Pilate wondered if He were already dead. And calling the centurion, he asked him whether He had died already.

45. And when he knew [it] from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.

46. And he bought a linen cloth, and took Him down, and wrapped [Him] in the linen, and laid Him in a tomb which was cut out of a rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the tomb.

47. And Mary Magdalene and Mary [the mother] of Joses saw where He was laid.

## Mark 16

1. And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary, [the mother] of James and Salome, had bought sweet spices so that they might come and anoint Him.

2. And very early in the morning, the first [day] of the week, they came upon the tomb, the sun having risen.

3. And they said among themselves, Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?

4. And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back, for it was very great.

5. And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right, clothed [in] a long white garment. And they were frightened.

6. And he said to them, Do not be frightened. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen, He is not here. Behold the place where they laid Him.

7. But go tell His disciples and Peter that He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see Him, as He said to you.

8. And they went out quickly and fled from the tomb. For they trembled and were amazed. Neither did they say anything to anyone, for they were afraid.

9. And when [Jesus] had risen early the first [day] of the Sabbath, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven demons.

10. She went [and] told those who had been with Him, as they mourned and wept.

11. And those hearing that He lives, and was seen by her, they did not believe.

12. After that He appeared in another form to two of them, walking [and] going into the country.

13. And they went and told [it] to the rest. Neither did they believe those.

14. Afterward He appeared to the Eleven as they reclined. And [He] reproached their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He had risen.

15. And He said to them, Go into all the world, proclaim the gospel to all the creation.

16. He who believes and is baptized will be saved, but he who does not believe will be condemned.

17. And miraculous] signs will follow to those believing these things: in My name they will cast out demons; they will speak new tongues;

18. they will take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them. They will lay hands on [the] sick, and they will be well.

19. Then indeed, after speaking to them, the Lord was taken up into Heaven, and sat on [the] right hand of God.

20. And going out, they proclaimed everywhere, the Lord working with [them] and confirming the word by miraculous] signs following. Amen.
