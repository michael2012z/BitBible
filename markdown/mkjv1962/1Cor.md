## 1 Corinthians 1

1. Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ through [the] will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,

2. to the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called out with all those in every place who call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours.

3. Grace [be] to you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

4. I thank my God always on your behalf [for] the grace of God given you in Jesus Christ,

5. that in everything you are enriched by Him, [in] all speech and in all knowledge;

6. even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you;

7. so that you come behind in no gift, waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.

8. He shall also confirm you to [the] end, [that you may be] blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

9. God [is] faithful, by whom you were called to [the] fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

10. But I exhort you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, [that] you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.

11. For it has been declared to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.

12. But I say this, that every one of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.

13. Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you, or were you baptized in the name of Paul?

14. I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,

15. lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name.

16. And I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Besides these, I do not know if I baptized any other.

17. For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel; not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.

18. For the preaching of the cross is foolishness to those being lost, but to us being saved, [it is] the power of God.

19. For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will set aside the understanding of the perceiving ones.

20. Where [is the] wise? Where [is the] scribe? Where [is the] lawyer of this world? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?

21. For since, in the wisdom of God, the world [by] wisdom did not know God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe.

22. For the Jews ask for a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom;

23. but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness.

24. But to them, the called-out ones, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is] the power of God and the wisdom of God.

25. Because the foolish thing of God is wiser than men, and the weak thing of God is stronger than men.

26. For you see your calling, brothers, that not many wise men according to the flesh [are called], not many mighty, not many noble.

27. But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;

28. and God has chosen the base things of the world, and things which are despised, and things which are not, in order to bring to nothing things that are;

29. so that no flesh should glory in His presence.

30. But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption;

31. so that, according as it is written, He who glories, let him glory in [the] Lord.

## 1 Corinthians 2

1. And I, brothers, when I came to you, did not come with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.

2. For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.

3. And I was with you in weakness and in fear, and in much trembling.

4. And my speech and my preaching [was] not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the] Spirit and of power,

5. so that your faith should not stand in [the] wisdom of men, but in [the] power of God.

6. But, we speak wisdom among those who are perfect; yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, that come to nothing.

7. But we speak [the] wisdom of God in a mystery, which God has hidden, predetermining it before the world for our glory;

8. which none of the rulers of this world knew (for if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory).

9. But as it is written, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for those who love Him.

10. But God has revealed [them] to us by His Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, yea, the deep things of God.

11. For who among men knows the things of a man except the spirit of man within him? So also no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.

12. But we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit from God, so that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God.

13. These things we also speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the] Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.

14. But the natural man does not receive the things of [the] Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; neither can he know [them], because they are spiritually discerned.

15. But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is judged by no one.

16. For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 3

1. And I, brothers, could not speak to you as to spiritual ones, but as to fleshly, as to babes in Christ.

2. I have fed you with milk and not with solid food, for you were not yet able [to bear it]; nor are you able even now.

3. For you are yet carnal. For in that [there is] among you envyings and strife and divisions, are you not carnal, and [do you not] walk according to men?

4. For while one says, I am of Paul; and another, I [am] of Apollos; are you not carnal?

5. Who then is Paul, and who [is] Apollos, but ministers by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to each?

6. I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.

7. So then neither is he who plants anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.

8. So he planting, and he watering, are one, and each one shall receive [his] own reward according to [his] own labor.

9. For of God we are fellow-workers, a field of God, and you are a building of God.

10. According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds [on it]. But let every man be careful how he builds [on it].

11. For any other foundation can no one lay than the one] being laid, who is Jesus Christ.

12. And if anyone builds on this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble,

13. each one's work shall be revealed. For the Day shall declare [it], because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try each one's work as to what kind it is.

14. If anyone's work which he built remains, he shall receive a reward.

15. If anyone's work shall be burned up, he shall suffer loss. But he shall be saved, yet so as by fire.

16. Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwells in you?

17. If anyone defiles the temple of God, God shall destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which you are.

18. Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool so that he may be wise.

19. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written, He takes the wise in their own craftiness.

20. And again,  The] Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.

21. Therefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours,

22. whether it is Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or [the] world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours,

23. and you are Christ's, and Christ [is] God's.

## 1 Corinthians 4

1. So let a man think of us as ministers of Christ and stewards of [the] mysteries of God.

2. And the rest, it is sought among stewards that one be found faithful.

3. But to me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by a man's day; but I do not judge my own self,

4. for I know nothing by myself. Yet I have not been justified by this, but He who judges me is [the] Lord.

5. Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts. And then shall each one have praise of God.

6. And these things, brothers, I have [in a figure] transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that you might learn in us not to think [of men] above that which is written, so that no one of you may [be] puffed up against one another.

7. For who makes you to differ [from another]? And what do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive [it], why do you boast as [if you] had not received it?

8. Already you are full! Already you are rich! You have reigned [as kings] without us! And oh that indeed you did reign, that we also might reign with you.

9. For I think that God has set forth us last, the apostles, as it were appointed to death; for we have become a spectacle to the world and to angels and to men.

10. We [are] fools for Christ's sake, but you [are] wise in Christ. We [are] weak, but you [are] strong. You [are] honorable, but we [are] despised.

11. Even until this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwelling place.

12. And we labor, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it;

13. being defamed, we entreat. We are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all [things] until now.

14. I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I warn [you].

15. For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet [you do] not [have] many fathers; for I have begotten you in Christ Jesus through the gospel.

16. Therefore I beseech you, be imitators of me.

17. For this cause I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved son and faithful in [the] Lord, who shall remind you [of] my ways which are] in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church.

18. As to my not coming to you now, some are puffed up.

19. But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills. And I will not know the speech of those who are puffed up, but the power.

20. For the kingdom of God [is] not in word, but in power.

21. What do you desire? Shall I come to you with a rod, or [in] love and the spirit of meekness?

## 1 Corinthians 5

1. On the whole it is reported [that there is] fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even named among the nations, so as one to have [his] father's wife.

2. And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, so that he who has done this deed may be taken from your midst.

3. For as being absent in body but present in spirit, I indeed have judged already [as though I were] present [concerning] him who worked out this thing;

4. in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, with my spirit; also, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ;

5. to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.

6. Your boasting [is] not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?

7. Therefore purge out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, as you are unleavened. For also Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us.

8. Therefore let us keep [the] feast; not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened [bread] of sincerity and truth.

9. I wrote to you in the letter not to associate intimately with fornicators;

10. yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then you must go out of the world.

11. But now I have written to you not to associate intimately, if any man called a brother [and is] either a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one not to eat.

12. For what [is it] to me to also judge those who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside?

13. But God judges those who are outside. Therefore put out from you the evil one.

## 1 Corinthians 6

1. Do any of you dare, when you have a matter against another, to go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?

2. Do you not know that the saints shall judge the world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?

3. Do you not know that we shall judge angels, not to mention the things] of this] life?

4. If, then, you truly have judgments of [the things] of this] life, set those who are least esteemed in the church [to judge].

5. For I speak to your shame. [Is it] so [that] there is not a wise one among you, not even one in your midst who shall be able to judge between his brother?

6. But brother goes to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.

7. Indeed then there is already on the whole a failure among you, that you have lawsuits with yourselves. Why not instead be wronged? Why not instead be defrauded?

8. But you do wrong and defraud, and these things to brothers.

9. Do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit [the] kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor abusers, nor homosexuals,

10. nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit [the] kingdom of God.

11. And such were some of you. But you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.

12. All things are lawful to me, but not all things profit. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.

13. Meats for the belly and the belly for meats, but God shall destroy both it and them. But the body [is] not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord is for the body.

14. And God has both raised up the Lord, and also will raise us up by His own power.

15. Do you not know that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make [them] the members of a harlot? Let it not be!

16. Or do you not know that he being joined to a harlot is one body? For He says, The two shall be one flesh.

17. But he being joined to the Lord is one spirit.

18. Flee fornication. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits fornication sins against [his] own body.

19. Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit in you, whom you have of God? And you are not your own,

20. for you are bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.

## 1 Corinthians 7

1. Now concerning what you wrote to me: [It is] good for a man not to touch a woman.

2. But, because of the fornications, let each have his [own] wife, and let each have her own husband.

3. Let the husband give to the wife proper kindness, and likewise the wife also to the husband.

4. The wife does not have authority over [her] own body, but the husband. And likewise also the husband does not have authority [over his] own body, but the wife.

5. Do not deprive one another, unless [it is] with consent for a time, so that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer. And come together again so that Satan does not tempt you for your incontinence.

6. But I speak this according to permission, not according to commandment.

7. For I would that all men were even as I myself am. But each has his proper gift from God, one according to this manner and another according to that.

8. I say therefore to the unmarried and the widows, It is good for them if they remain even as I.

9. But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn.

10. And to the married I command (not I, but the Lord), a woman not to be separated from [her] husband.

11. But if she is indeed separated, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to [her] husband. And a husband is not to leave [his] wife.

12. But to the rest I speak, not the Lord, If any brother has a wife who does not believe, and she is pleased to dwell with him, do not let him put her away.

13. And the woman who has a husband who does not believe, if he is pleased to dwell with her, do not let her leave him.

14. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; else your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.

15. But if the unbelieving one separates, let [him] be separated. A brother or a sister is not in bondage in such [cases], but God has called us in peace.

16. For what do you know, O wife, whether you shall save [your] husband? Or what do you know, O man, whether you shall save [your] wife?

17. But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all churches.

18. [Was] any called having been circumcised? Do not be uncircumcised. Was anyone called in uncircumcision? Do not be circumcised.

19. Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.

20. Let each one remain in the calling in which he was called.

21. Were you called as a slave? It does not matter to you, but if you are able to become free, use [it] rather.

22. For he who is called a slave in [the] Lord is a freed man of [the] Lord. And likewise, he who is called a free man is a slave of Christ.

23. You are bought with a price, do not be the slaves of men.

24. Each in whatever way he was called, brothers, in this remain with God.

25. But concerning virgins, I have no commandment from [the] Lord. Yet I give my judgment, as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be faithful.

26. Then I think this is good, because of the present necessity; that [it is] good for a man to be so.

27. Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife.

28. But if you do marry, you did not sin; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But such shall have trouble in the flesh, but I spare you.

29. But this I say, brothers, The time [is] short. It remains that both those who have wives should be as not having one.

30. And they who weep are as [though they did] not weep. And they who rejoice are as [though they did] not rejoice. And they who buy are as though they did] not possess.

31. And they who use this world are] as not abusing [it], for the fashion of this world is passing away.

32. But I desire you to be without anxiety. The [one] who is unmarried cares for the things that belong to [the] Lord, how to please the Lord.

33. But the [one] who is married cares for the things of the world, how to please [his] wife.

34. The wife and the virgin [are] different. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please [her husband.

35. And this I speak for your own profit, not that I may cast a snare on you, but for that which is right, and that you may attend on the Lord without distraction.

36. But if anyone thinks [it] behaving himself indecently toward his virgin (if she is past [her] prime, and so it ought to be) let him do what he will; he does not sin; let them marry.

37. But [he] who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but who has authority over [his] own will (and has so judged in his heart that he will keep his virginity) he does well.

38. So then he who gives in marriage does well. But he who does not give in marriage does better.

39. The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives, but if her husband sleeps in death, she is at liberty to be remarried to whom she will, only in the Lord.

40. But she is happier if she so remains, according to my judgment. And I also think that I have [the] Spirit of God.

## 1 Corinthians 8

1. But concerning the sacrifices to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies.

2. And if any man thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.

3. But if any one loves God, he has been known of him.

4. Then concerning the eating of the things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol [is] nothing in [the] world, and that [there] is no other God except one.

5. For though there are those who are called gods, whether in Heaven or in earth (as there are many gods and many lords),

6. but [there is] to us [only] one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we by Him.

7. But this knowledge [is] not in all. But some being aware of the idol eat as an idolatrous sacrifice until now, and their conscience being weak is defiled.

8. But food does not commend us to God. For neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we do not eat are we the worse.

9. But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours becomes a stumbling block to those who are weak.

10. For if anyone sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol temple, will not the weak one's conscience be lifted up so as to eat things sacrificed to idols?

11. And on your knowledge the weak brother will fall, he for whom Christ died.

12. And sinning in this way against [your] brothers, and wounding their conscience, being weak, you sin against Christ.

13. Therefore, if food offends my brother, I will eat no flesh forever, that I do not offend my brother.

## 1 Corinthians 9

1. Am I not an apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are you not my work in [the] Lord?

2. If I am not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you, for you are the seal of my apostleship in [the] Lord.

3. My answer to those who examine me is this:

4. Do we not have authority to eat and to drink?

5. Do we not have authority to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and [as] the brothers of the Lord do, and Cephas?

6. Or [is it] only Barnabas and I [who] have no authority whether] not to work?

7. Who serves as a soldier at his own wages at any time? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a flock and does not partake of the milk of the flock?

8. Do I say these things according to man? Or does not the Law say the same also?

9. For it is written in the law of Moses, You shall not muzzle an ox threshing grain. Does God take care for oxen?

10. Or does He say [it] altogether for our sakes? It was written for us, so that he who plows should plow [in] hope, and so that he who threshes [in] hope should be partaker of his hope.

11. If we have sown to you spiritual things, [is it] a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?

12. If others have a share of [this] authority [over] you, rather [should] not we? But we have not used this authority, but we endured all things lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.

13. Do you not know that those who minister about holy things live [of the things] of the temple? And those attending the altar are partakers with the altar.

14. Even so, the Lord ordained those announcing the gospel to live from the gospel.

15. But I have used none of these things, nor have I written these things that it should be done so to me; for [it is] good for me rather to die than that anyone nullify my glorying.

16. For though I preach the gospel, no glory is to me. For necessity is laid on me; yea, woe is to me if I do not preach the gospel!

17. For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward; but if against my will, I am entrusted with a stewardship.

18. What then is my reward? That when I preach the gospel I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I may not abuse my authority in the gospel.

19. For though I am free from all, yet I have made myself servant to all, so that I might gain the more.

20. And to the Jews I became as a Jew, so that I might gain the Jews. To those who are under the Law, [I became] as under the Law, so that I might gain those who are under the Law.

21. To those who are outside Law, [I became] as outside Law (not being outside law to God, but under [the] law to Christ), so that I might gain those who are outside Law.

22. To the weak I became as the weak, so that I might gain the weak. I am made all things to all [men], so that I might by all means save some.

23. And this I do for the sake of the gospel, so that I might be partaker of it [with you].

24. Do you not know that those running in a race all run, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may obtain.

25. And everyone who strives for the mastery is temperate in all things. Then those truly that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.

26. So then I run, not as if I were uncertain. And so I fight, not as [one who] beats the air.

27. But I buffet my body, and lead [it] captive, lest proclaiming to others I myself might be rejected.

## 1 Corinthians 10

1. And, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea.

2. And all were baptized to Moses in the cloud and in the sea,

3. and all ate the same spiritual food,

4. and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of the spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ.

5. But with many of them God was not well pleased, for they were scattered in the wilderness.

6. And these things were our examples, that we should not be lusters after evil, as they also lusted.

7. Nor should we be idolaters, even as some of them, as it is written: The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.

8. Nor let us commit fornication, as some of them fornicated, and twenty-three thousand fell in one day.

9. Nor let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted Him and were destroyed by serpents.

10. Nor murmur as some of them also murmured and were destroyed by the destroyer.

11. And all these things happened to them [as] examples; and [it] is written for our warning on whom the ends of the world have come.

12. So let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.

13. No temptation has taken you but [what is] common to man; but God [is] faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able, but with the temptation also will make a way to escape, so that you may be able to bear [it].

14. Therefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.

15. I speak as to wise men; you judge what I say.

16. The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?

17. For we, the many, are one bread [and] one body; for we are all partakers of that one bread.

18. Behold Israel after the flesh. Are not those who eat of the sacrifices also partakers of the altar?

19. What then do I say? That the idol is anything, or that an idolatrous sacrifice is anything?

20. But [I say] that the things which the nations sacrifice, [they] sacrifice to demons and not to God. And I do not desire that you should have fellowship with demons.

21. You cannot drink [the] cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot be partakers of [the] Lord's table and of a table of demons.

22. Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?

23. All things are lawful to me, but not all things profit. All things are lawful to me, but not all things build up.

24. Let no one seek his own, but each one another's.

25. Eat whatever is sold in the meat market, asking no question for conscience' sake;

26. for the earth [is] the Lord's, and the fullness of it.

27. If any of those who do not believe invite you [to a feast], and if you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for conscience' sake.

28. But if anyone says to you, This is slain in sacrifice to idols, do not eat for the sake of him who showed [it], and for conscience' sake; for the earth [is] the Lord's, and the fullness of it;

29. conscience, I say, not your own, but the other's. For why is my liberty judged by another's conscience?

30. For if I by grace am a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that [for] which I give thanks?

31. Therefore whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.

32. Give no offense, either to the Jews, or to the Greeks or to the church of God;

33. even as I please all [men] in all [things], not seeking my own profit, but the [profit] of the many, so that they may be saved.

## 1 Corinthians 11

1. Be imitators of me, even as I also [am] of Christ.

2. But I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and you keep the doctrines as I delivered [them] to you.

3. But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman [is] the man; and the head of Christ [is] God.

4. Every man praying or prophesying with [his] head covered dishonors his Head.

5. But every woman who prays or prophesies with [her] head unveiled dishonors her head; for that is even the same as if she were shaved.

6. For if the woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn. But [if it] is a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled.

7. For a man indeed ought not to have [his] head covered, because he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is [the] glory of [the] man.

8. For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.

9. Nor was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man.

10. For this reason the woman ought to have authority on [her] head because of the angels.

11. But neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.

12. For as the woman [is] of the man, even so the man [is] also through the woman; but all things of God.

13. Judge among yourselves: is it right that a woman pray to God unveiled?

14. Does not even nature itself teach you that if man has long hair, it is a shame to him?

15. But if a woman should have long hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her in place of a veil.

16. But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the churches of God.

17. But in enjoining this, I do not praise [you], because you come together not for the better, but for the worse.

18. For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there are divisions among you, and I partly believe it.

19. For there must also be heresies among you, that the approved ones may be revealed among you.

20. Therefore when you come together into one place, [this] is not to eat [the] Lord's supper.

21. For in eating each one takes his own supper first; and one is hungry, and another drunken.

22. For do you not have houses [in which] to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God, and shame those who do not have? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? I do not praise [you] !

23. For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread;

24. And giving thanks, He broke [it] and said, Take, eat; this is My body, which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of Me.

25. In the same way [He took] the cup also, after supping, saying, This cup is the New Covenant in My blood; as often as you drink it, do this in remembrance of Me.

26. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death until He shall come.

27. So that whoever shall eat this bread and drink [this] cup of the Lord unworthily, he will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.

28. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of [that] bread and drink of that cup.

29. For he who eats and drinks unworthily eats and drinks condemnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.

30. For this cause many among you [are] weak and sickly, and many sleep.

31. For if we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged.

32. But when we are judged, we are chastened by [the] Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.

33. So that, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.

34. But if anyone hungers, let him eat at home, so that you do not come together to condemnation. And the rest I will set in order when I come.

## 1 Corinthians 12

1. Now concerning spiritual [gifts], brothers, I would not have you ignorant.

2. You know that being led away, you nations were led to dumb idols.

3. Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by [the] Spirit of God says Jesus [is] a curse, and [that] no one can say that Jesus [is] Lord, but by the Holy Spirit.

4. But there are differences of gifts, but the same Spirit.

5. And there are differences of ministries, but the same Lord.

6. And there are differences of workings, but it is the same God working all things in all.

7. But to each one is given the showing forth of the Spirit to [our] profit.

8. For through the Spirit is given to one a word of wisdom; and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;

9. and to another faith by the same Spirit; and to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;

10. and to another workings of powers, to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; and to another kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues.

11. But the one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing separately to each one as He desires.

12. For as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, [are] one body; so also [is] Christ.

13. For also by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free, even all were made to drink into one Spirit.

14. For the body is not one member, but many.

15. If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?

16. And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?

17. If all the body [were] an eye, where [would be] the hearing? If all hearing, where [would be] the smelling?

18. But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body as it has pleased Him.

19. And if they were all one member, where [would be] the body?

20. But now indeed many [are] the members, yet only one body.

21. And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.

22. But much rather the members of the body seeming to be weaker are necessary.

23. And those [members] of the body which we think to be less honorable, on these we put more abundant honor around [them]. And our unpresentable [members] have more abundant propriety.

24. For our presentable [members] have no need, but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to the [member] having need;

25. that there not be division in the body, but [that] the members should have the same care for one another.

26. And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with [it]; if one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with [it].

27. And you are the body of Christ, and members in part.

28. And God set some in the church, firstly, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers, then works of power, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, kinds of languages.

29. [Are] all apostles? [Are] all prophets? [Are] all teachers? [Are] all workers of power?

30. Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak languages? Do all interpret?

31. But zealously strive after the better gifts. And yet I show to you a more excellent way.

## 1 Corinthians 13

1. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I have become [as] sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.

2. And though I have prophecies, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so as to move mountains, and do not have charity, I am nothing.

3. And though I give out all my goods to feed the poor], and though I deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, I am profited nothing.

4. Charity has patience, is kind; charity is not envious, is not vain, is not puffed up;

5. does not behave indecently, does not seek her own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil.

6. Charity does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices in the truth,

7. quietly covers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

8. Charity never fails. But if [there are] prophecies, they will be abolished; if tongues, they shall cease; if knowledge, it will be abolished.

9. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.

10. But when the perfect thing comes, then that which is in part will be caused to cease.

11. When I was an infant, I spoke as an infant, I thought as an infant, I reasoned as an infant. But when I became a man, I did away with the things of an infant.

12. For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall fully know even as I also am fully known.

13. And now faith, hope, charity, these three remain; but the greatest of these [is] charity.

## 1 Corinthians 14

1. Follow after charity and desire spiritual [things], but rather that you may prophesy.

2. For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God. For no one hears, but in spirit he speaks mysteries.

3. But he who prophesies speaks to men [for] building up, and exhortation, and comfort.

4. The one speaking in a tongue builds himself up, but he prophesying builds up a church.

5. I wish all of you to speak in languages, but rather that you may prophesy; for greater [is] he prophesying than he speaking in tongues, unless he interpret so that the church may receive building up.

6. But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you, except I speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?

7. Yet lifeless things giving a sound, whether flute or harp, if they do not give a distinction in the sound, how will it be known what is being piped or harped?

8. For also if a trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for the battle?

9. So also you, if you do not give a clear word through the language, how will it be known what [is] being said? For you will be speaking into the air.

10. So it may be many kinds of sounds are in [the] world, and not one [is] without a distinct sound.

11. Therefore if I do not know the power of the sound, I will be a foreigner to him speaking, and he speaking [will be] a foreigner to me.

12. Even so you, since you are zealots of spiritual [things], seek to build up the church, in order that you may abound

13. So then he speaking in a language, let him pray that he may interpret.

14. For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.

15. What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the mind; I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the mind.

16. Else, if you bless in the spirit, he occupying the place of the unlearned, how will he say the amen at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you say?

17. For you truly give thanks well, but the other is not built up.

18. I thank my God [that] I speak more languages than all of you;

19. yet in a church I desire to speak five words with my mind, so that I might also teach others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.

20. Brothers, do not be children in your minds, but in malice be like infants, and in your minds be mature.

21. In the law it is written, By other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people, and even so they will not hear Me, says the Lord.

22. So that tongues are not a sign to those who believe, but to those who do not believe. But prophesying [is] not to those who do not believe, but to those who believe.

23. Therefore if the whole church has come together, and all speak in languages, and if uninstructed ones or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you rave?

24. But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or one not instructed comes, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all.

25. And so the secrets of his heart become revealed. And so, falling down on [his] face, he will worship God and report that God is truly among you.

26. Then how is it, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be for building up.

27. If one speaks in a language, [let it be] by two, or [at] the most three, and in succession. And let one interpret.

28. But if there is no interpreter, let him be silent in a church; and let him speak to himself and to God.

29. And [if there are] two or three prophets, let them speak, and let the others judge.

30. If [a revelation] is revealed to another sitting by, let the first be silent.

31. For you may all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all may be comforted.

32. And the spirits of the prophets [are] subject to the prophets.

33. For God is not [the author] of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.

34. Let your women be silent in the churches; for it is not permitted to them to speak, but to be in subjection, as the Law also says.

35. And if they desire to learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in a church.

36. Or did the Word of God go out from you? Or did it reach only to you?

37. If anyone thinks to be a prophet, or a spiritual one, let him recognize the things I write to you, that they are a commandment of the Lord.

38. But if any is ignorant, let him be ignorant.

39. So then, brothers, seek to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak in languages.

40. Let all things be done decently and in order.

## 1 Corinthians 15

1. And, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and in which you stand;

2. by which you also are being kept safe, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.

3. For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures,

4. and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures;

5. and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the Twelve.

6. Afterward He was seen by over five hundred brothers at once, of whom the greater part remain until this present day, but also some fell asleep.

7. Afterward He was seen by James, then by all the apostles.

8. And last of all He was seen by me also, as one born out of time.

9. For I am the least of the apostles and am not sufficient to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

10. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace which [was] toward me has not been without fruit, but I labored more abundantly than all of them; yet not I, but the grace of God with me.

11. Therefore whether [it was] I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.

12. But if Christ is proclaimed, that He was raised from [the] dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?

13. But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.

14. And if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation [is] worthless, and your faith [is] also worthless.

15. And we are also found [to be] false witnesses of God, because we testified of God that He raised Christ; whom He did not raise if the dead are not raised.

16. For if [the] dead are not raised, then Christ is not raised.

17. And if Christ is not raised, your faith [is] foolish; you are yet in your sins.

18. Then also those that fell asleep in Christ were lost.

19. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.

20. But now Christ has risen from [the] dead, [and] has become the firstfruit of those who slept.

21. For since death [is] through man, the resurrection of [the] dead also [is] through a Man.

22. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all will be made alive.

23. But each in [his] own order: Christ the first-fruit, and afterward they who are Christ's at His coming;

24. then [is] the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God, even the Father; when He makes to cease all rule and all authority and power.

25. for it is right for Him to reign until He has put all the enemies under His feet.

26. The last enemy made to cease [is] death.

27. For He put all things under His feet. But when He says that all things have been put under [His feet], it is plain that [it] excepts Him who has put all things under Him.

28. But when all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subject to Him who has subjected all things to Him, so that God may be all things in all.

29. Otherwise, what will they do, those being baptized on behalf of [the] dead? If the dead are not at all raised, why indeed are they baptized on behalf of [the] dead?

30. And why are we also in danger every hour?

31. Day by day I die, by your rejoicing, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.

32. If according to man I fought with beasts in Ephesus, what advantage is to me if [the] dead are not raised? Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!

33. Do not be deceived; evil companionships corrupt good habits.

34. Be righteously awake, and sin not; for some have ignorance of God. I speak [this] to your shame.

35. But someone will say, How are the dead raised up, and with what body do they come?

36. Foolish one! What you sow is not made alive unless it dies.

37. And what you sow, you do not sow the body that [is] going to be, but a bare grain (perhaps of wheat or of some of the rest).

38. And God gives it a body as it has pleased Him, and to each of the seeds its own body.

39. All flesh [is] not the same flesh; but one [kind of] flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another of fish, and another of birds.

40. [There are] also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But the glory of the heavenly [is] truly different, and that of the earthly different;

41. one glory of [the] sun, and another glory of [the] moon, and another glory of [the] stars; for [one] star differs from [another] star in glory.

42. So also the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;

43. it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;

44. it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.

45. And so it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul, the last Adam was a life-giving Spirit.

46. But not the spiritual first, but the natural; afterward the spiritual.

47. The first man [was] out of earth, earthy; the second Man [was] the Lord from Heaven.

48. Such the earthy [man], such also the earthy ones. And such the heavenly [Man], such also the heavenly ones.

49. And according as we bore the image of the earthy [man], we shall also bear the image of the heavenly [Man].

50. And I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit [the] kingdom of God, nor does corruption inherit incorruption.

51. Behold, I speak a mystery to you; we shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be changed;

52. in a moment, in a glance of an eye, at the last trumpet. For a trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall all be changed.

53. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal [must] put on immortality.

54. But when this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and when this mortal shall put on immortality, then will take place the word that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

55. O death, where [is] your sting? O grave, where [is] your victory?

56. The sting of death [is] sin, and the strength of sin [is] the law.

57. But thanks [be] to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

58. So that, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not without fruit in the Lord.

## 1 Corinthians 16

1. And concerning the collection for the saints, as I charged the churches of Galatia, so also you do.

2. On the first of the sabbaths let each of you put by himself, storing up what ever he is prospered, so that there may be no collections when I come.

3. And when I come, whomever you shall approve by [your] letters, I will send them to bring your gift to Jerusalem.

4. And if it is suitable for me to go also, they shall go with me.

5. But I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia; for I am going through Macedonia.

6. And it may be that I will stay with you, and even spend the winter with you, so that you may set me forward wherever I go.

7. For I do not desire to see you now in passage, but I am hoping to stay some time with you, if the Lord permits.

8. But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost.

9. For a great and effective door opened to me, and many [are] opposing.

10. But if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he works the work of the Lord, even as I [do].

11. Therefore let not any despise him, but set him forward in peace, so that he may come to me; for I am waiting for him with the brothers.

12. As regards [our] brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come to you with the brothers, but it was not altogether [his] will that he come now. But he will come when he has opportunity.

13. Watch! Stand fast in the faith! Be men! Be strong!

14. Let all your things be done in charity.

15. But I exhort you, brothers. You know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruit of Achaia, and they appointed themselves to ministry to the saints.

16. See that you also submit to such ones, and to everyone working and laboring with [me].

17. I am glad at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus; for these supplied your lack.

18. For they have refreshed my spirit and yours; then acknowledge such ones.

19. The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in [the] Lord, with the church that is in their house.

20. All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.

21. The salutation of Paul with my own hand.

22. If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. The Lord comes!

23. May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you.

24. Let my love [be] with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
