# Ezekiel

## Ezekiel 1

1. And it happened in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month], in the fifth of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.

2. On the fifth of the month, the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,

3. Coming the Word of Jehovah became known] to Ezekiel, the son of Buzi, the priest in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar. And the hand of the LORD was on him there.

4. And I looked, and behold, a windstorm came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire flashing itself, and a brightness to it all around, and out of its midst, like the color of polished bronze out of the middle of the fire.

5. Also out of its midst [came] the likeness of four living creatures. And this [was] how they looked; they had the likeness of a man.

6. And four faces [were] to each, and four wings to each.

7. And their feet [were] straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot. And they sparkled like the color of burnished copper.

8. And the [hands] of a man [extended] from under their wings on their four sides; and the four of them [had] their faces and their wings,

9. joining each one to the other [by] their wings. They did not turn in their going; each one went toward the front of their face.

10. And the likeness of their faces: the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right [side] to the four of them; and the face of an ox on the left side to the four of them; and the face of an eagle to the four of them.

11. So their faces [were]. And their wings [were] stretched upward; to each, the two [wings] of each one were joined; and two [wings] covered their bodies.

12. And each went toward the front of their faces. To where the spirit was to go, there they went; they did not turn in their going.

13. And the likeness of the living creatures: they looked like burning coals of fire; like the appearance of torches. It was continually circling among the living creatures. And the fire [was] bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.

14. And the living creatures kept running and returning, like the appearance of a flash of lightning.

15. And as I looked at the living creatures, behold, one wheel [was] on the earth by the living creatures, with its four faces.

16. The appearance of the wheels and their workmanship [was] the color of beryl, and the four of them had one likeness. And their appearance and their workmanship [was] like a wheel in the middle of a wheel.

17. When they went, they went on their four sides; [and] they did not turn when they went.

18. And their rims: they [were] even high; they were even awesome. And their rims [were] full of eyes all around the four of them.

19. And in the going of the living creatures, the wheels went beside them; and in the lifting up of the living creatures from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.

20. Wherever the spirit was to go, there they went; there the spirit [was] to go, and the wheels were lifted up along with them. For the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.

21. In their going, [these] went; and in their standing still, these stood still. And in their lifting up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up along with them. For the spirit of the living creature [was] in the wheels.

22. And there [was] a likeness over the heads of the living creature; an expanse, like the color of awesome crystal stretched out over their heads from above.

23. And under the expanse their wings [were] straight, the one toward the other. Each one had two [wings] covering on this [side], and to each two covering on that [side of] their bodies.

24. And I heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, in their going [was] the sound of tumult, like the sound of an army. In their standing still, they let down their wings.

25. And there was a voice from the expanse which [was] over their heads, in their standing still, and they let down their wings.

26. And from above the expanse that [was] over their heads [was] a likeness like a sapphire stone, the likeness of a throne. And on the likeness of the throne [was] a likeness looking like a man on it from above.

27. And I saw [Him] looking like the color of polished bronze, looking like fire all around within it. From the likeness of His loins even upward, and from the likeness of His loins even downward, I saw [Him], looking like fire, and it had brightness all around.

28. As the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain looks, so the brightness all around looked. This was how the likeness of the glory of the LORD looked. And I saw. And I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of One speaking.

## Ezekiel 2

1. And He said to me, Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you.

2. And the Spirit entered into me when He spoke to me, and set me on my feet, so that I heard Him who spoke to me.

3. And He said to me, Son of man, I am sending you to the sons of Israel, to the nations, the rebelling ones who have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have sinned against Me, to this day.

4. And the sons [are] stiff of face, and hard of heart. I am sending you to them; and you shall say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah.

5. And they, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear; for they [are] a rebellious house. Yea, they shall know that there has been a prophet among them.

6. And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them, and of their words, though briers and thorns [are] with you, and you dwell among scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words, nor frightened by their faces, though they [are] a rebellious house.

7. And you shall speak My words to them, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear, for they [are] rebellious.

8. But you, son of man, hear what I am saying to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.

9. And I looked, and behold! A hand [was] extended to me; and lo, a roll of a book [was] in it.

10. And He spread it before me; and it [was] written on the face and the back. And written on it [were] weepings, and mourning, and woe.

## Ezekiel 3

1. And He said to me, Son of man, eat what you find. Eat this roll, and go speak to the house of Israel.

2. So I opened my mouth, and He caused me to eat that roll.

3. And He said to me, Son of man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your belly with this roll that I give you. Then I ate [it]; and in my mouth it was like honey for sweetness.

4. And He said to me, Son of man, go! Go up to the house of Israel and speak to them with My words.

5. For you [are] not sent to a people of a deep lip and of a difficult language, [but] to the house of Israel;

6. not to many people of a deep lip and of a difficult language, whose words you cannot hear. Surely, if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you.

7. But the house of Israel will not listen to you, for they will not listen to Me; for all the house of Israel [are] strong of forehead and hard of heart.

8. Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces and your forehead strong against their foreheads.

9. I have made your forehead as an adamant harder than flint. Do not be bowed down by their faces, though they [are] a rebellious house.

10. And He said to me, Son of man, receive all My words which I shall speak to you in your heart, and hear with your ears.

11. And go! Go to those of the captivity, to the sons of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, So says the Lord Jehovah; whether they will hear or whether they will forbear.

12. And the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a sound of a great rushing, [saying], Blessed [be] the glory of the LORD from His place.

13. [I] also [heard] the sound of the wings of the living creatures touching one another, and the sound of the wheels along with them, and a sound of a great rushing.

14. So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong on me.

15. Then I came to the exiles at Tel-at-abib, who lived by the river Chebar. And I sat [where] they sat; and I also dwelt seven days, being stricken dumb among them.

16. And it happened at the end of seven days, even it happened [that] the Word of the LORD [came] to me, saying,

17. Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word of My mouth, and give them warning from Me.

18. When I say to the wicked, You shall surely die; and you do not give him warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked one shall die in his iniquity; but I will require his blood at your hand.

19. Yet if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.

20. And when the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and when I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die. Because you have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand.

21. But if you warn the righteous so that the righteous does not sin, and if he does not sin, he shall surely live because he is warned; also you have delivered your soul.

22. And the hand of the LORD was on me there. And He said to me, Arise, go out into the plain, and I will talk with you there.

23. Then I arose and went out into the plain; and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chebar. And I fell on my face.

24. And the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet; and spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut yourself inside your house!

25. But you, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands on you and shall bind you with them, and you shall not go out among them.

26. And I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be dumb and shall not be one who warns them. For they [are] a rebellious house.

27. But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: He who hears, let him hear; and he who stops his ears, let him stop; for they [are] a rebellious house.

## Ezekiel 4

1. And you, son of man, take a tile to yourself, and lay it before you, and portray on it the city Jerusalem.

2. And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mound against it. Also set the camp against it, and set [battering] rams against it all around.

3. And take an iron griddle to yourself, and set it [for] a wall of iron between you and the city. And set your face against it, and it shall be under attack. And you shall set a battle against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.

4. Also lie on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it; [according] to the number of days that you shall lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity.

5. For I have laid on you the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days. So you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.

6. And when you have fulfilled them, lie again on your right side, and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days; a day for a year; a day for a year, I have set for you.

7. And you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and your arm [shall be] uncovered, and you shall prophesy against it.

8. And, behold, I will lay bands on you, and you shall not turn yourself from one side to [another] until you have ended the days of your siege.

9. Take also to yourself wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make bread of them for yourself. [According] to the number of the days that you shall lie on your side, three hundred and ninety days, you shall eat of it.

10. And your food which you shall eat [shall be] by weight twenty shekels a day; from time to time you shall eat it.

11. You shall also drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin. From time to time you shall drink.

12. And you shall eat it [as] barley cakes, and you shall bake it with dung of the excrement of man, in their sight.

13. And the LORD said, Even so shall the sons of Israel eat their defiled bread among the nations, where I will drive them.

14. Then I said, Ah Lord Jehovah! Behold, my soul has not been defiled. For from my youth up, even till now, I have not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither did there come any unclean flesh into my mouth.

15. Then He said to me, Lo, I have given you cow's dung for man's dung, and you shall prepare your bread with it.

16. And He said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem. And they shall eat bread by weight, and with care. And they shall drink water by measure, and in silence,

17. so that they may lack bread and water, and be stricken dumb with one another, and waste away in their iniquity.

## Ezekiel 5

1. And you, son of man, take a sharp sword to yourself, take a barber's razor also, and cause [it] to pass on your head and on your beard. Then take scales to weigh, and divide the [hair].

2. You shall burn a third part with fire in the middle of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and you shall take a third part [and] beat around it with a sword; and you shall scatter a third part in the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.

3. Also you shall take a few of them in number, and tie them up in your skirts.

4. Then take of them again, and throw them into the middle of the fire, and burn them in the fire; for a fire shall come forth from them into all the house of Israel.

5. So says the Lord Jehovah: This [is] Jerusalem. I have set it in the middle of the nations, and all around her [are] the lands.

6. And she has changed My judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and [defiled] My laws more than the countries that [are] all around her; for they have rejected My judgments and My laws; they have not walked in them.

7. Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: Because you multiplied more than the nations that [are] all around you, [and] have not walked in My laws, neither have kept My judgments, nor have done according to the judgments of the nations all around you;

8. therefore so says the Lord Jehovah; Behold, I, even I, [am] against you, and will carry out judgments in your midst before the nations.

9. And I will do in you that which I have not done, and the like of which I will never do again, because of all your abominations.

10. So the fathers shall eat the sons in your midst, and the sons shall eat their fathers. And I will execute judgments in you, and I will scatter the whole remnant of you into all the winds.

11. Therefore, [as] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, surely, because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable things, and with all your abominations, therefore I will also withdraw; nor shall My eye spare you, nor will I have any pity.

12. A third part of you shall die with the plague, and shall be consumed with the famine in your midst. And a third part shall fall by the sword all around you; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.

13. So My anger shall be fulfilled, and I will cause My fury to rest on them, and I will be comforted. And they shall know that I the LORD have spoken [it] in My zeal, when I have fulfilled My fury in them.

14. And I will make you a waste and a curse among the nations that [are] all around you, in the sight of all who pass by.

15. So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an chastening and a horror to the nations which [are] all around you, when I shall execute judgments against you in anger and in fury and in rebukes [among them]. I the LORD have spoken it.

16. When I shall send on them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for [their] ruin, which I will send to destroy you; even I will increase the famine on you, and break your staff of bread;

17. yea, I will send on you famine and evil beasts, and you will be bereaved. And pestilence and blood shall pass among you; and I shall bring a sword on you. I the LORD have spoken.

## Ezekiel 6

1. And it happened, the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them.

3. And say, Mountains of Israel, hear the Word of the Lord. So says the Lord Jehovah to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers and to the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword on you, and I will destroy your high places.

4. And your altars shall be wasted, and your pillars shall be broken. And I will make fall your slain before your idols.

5. And I will put the dead bodies of the sons of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones around your altars.

6. In all the places where you live, cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be deserted; so that your altars may be laid waste and become guilty, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your pillars may be cut down, and your works wiped out.

7. And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and you shall know that I [am] the LORD.

8. Yet I will leave a reminder that may be [left] to you [some] who escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered through the lands.

9. And those of you who escape shall remember Me among the nations where they shall be exiled, because I was broken [by] their whoring heart which has departed from Me, and with their whoring eyes which go after their idols. And they shall despise themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.

10. And they shall know that I [am] the LORD, [and that] I have not said in vain to do this evil to them.

11. So says the Lord Jehovah: Strike with your hand and stamp with your foot, and say, Alas, for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! For they shall fall by the sword, and by the famine, and by the plague.

12. He who is afar off shall die of the plague; and he who is near shall fall by the sword; and he who remains and is under siege shall die by the famine. So I will fulfill My fury on them.

13. Then you shall know that I [am] the LORD, when their dead shall be among their idols all around their altars, on every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every leafy oak, the place where they offered sweet aroma to all their idols.

14. And I will stretch out My hand on them and make the land a waste, even more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all the places where they live; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.

## Ezekiel 7

1. And it happened, the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

2. And you, son of man, so says the Lord Jehovah to the land of Israel: An end! The end has come on the four corners of the land.

3. Now the end [is] on you, and I will send My anger on you and will judge you according to your ways, and will lay on you all your abominations.

4. And My eye shall not spare you, neither will I have pity. But I will repay your ways on you, and your abominations shall be in your midst; and you shall know that I [am] the LORD.

5. So says the Lord Jehovah: An evil: Behold, an only evil has come!

6. An end has come, the end has come. It awakes against you; behold, it has come.

7. The encirclement has come to you, O dwellers of the land. The time has come, the day of tumult [is] near, and not a shout of the mountains.

8. And I will soon pour out My fury on you, and fulfill My anger on you. And I will judge you according to your ways, and will repay you for all your abominations.

9. And My eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; I will repay you according to your ways and your abominations [that] are in your midst. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD who strikes.

10. Behold the day! Behold, it has come; the encirclement has gone out; the rod has blossomed; pride has budded.

11. Violence has risen up for a rod of wickedness. None of them [shall remain], nor of their multitude, nor of any of their riches; nor [shall] there [be] wailing for them.

12. The time has come; the day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath [is] on all her multitude.

13. For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they are still alive; for the vision to all her multitude shall not return, and a man shall not hold his life strong in iniquity.

14. They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goes to the battle, for My wrath [is] on all her multitude.

15. The sword [is] outside, and the plague and the famine inside. He who [is] in the field shall die with the sword; and he in the city shall be devoured by famine and plague.

16. But [if] their fugitives shall escape, then they shall be like doves of the valleys on the mountains, all of them mourning, each one for his iniquity.

17. All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall go [weak as] water.

18. They shall also gird [on] sackcloth, and trembling shall cover them; and shame [shall be] on all faces, and baldness on all heads.

19. They shall throw their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be an impure thing. Their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD. They shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels; because their iniquity has become a stumbling-block for them.

20. And the beauty of His ornament, He set it in majesty. But they made the images of their abominations [and] of their hateful things in it; therefore I have put it to them as an impure thing.

21. And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prize, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall defile it.

22. I will also turn My face from them, and they shall defile My secret [place]; and violent ones shall enter into it and defile it.

23. Make a chain; for the land is full of bloody judgments, and the city is full of violence.

24. And I will bring the most evil of the nations, and they shall possess their houses. I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.

25. Ruin comes; and they shall seek peace, but none [shall be].

26. Disaster on disaster shall come, and rumor to rumor shall be. And they shall seek a vision from the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and wisdom from the elders.

27. The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with despair, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled. I will do to them according to their way, and according to their judgments I will judge them; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.

## Ezekiel 8

1. And it was in the sixth year, in the sixth [month], on the fifth of the month, I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting before me. And the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell on me there.

2. And I looked, and behold! A likeness as the look of fire; from the appearance of His loins and downward, [like] fire. And from His loins and upward as the look of brightness, like the color of polished bronze.

3. And He put out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head. And the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heavens, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the opening of the inner gate facing north, where there [was] a seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.

4. And, behold! The glory of the God of Israel [was] there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.

5. And He said to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now to the way of the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and behold, northward at the gate of the altar the image of jealousy [was] at the entrance.

6. And He said to me, Son of man, do you see what they do; even the great abominations which the house of Israel is doing here, that I should go far off from My sanctuary? But turn again, [and] you shall see greater abominations.

7. And He brought me to the opening of the court; and I looked, and behold, a hole in the wall.

8. And He said to me, Son of man, dig in the wall now. And I dug in the wall, and, behold, an opening.

9. And he said to me. Go in and see the evil abominations that they do here.

10. And I went in and saw. And behold, every kind of creeping thing, and hateful beast, and all the idols of the house of Israel, were carved on the wall all around.

11. And seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, standing among them, these were before them, and each man with his censor in his hand. And the odor of the cloud of incense was rising.

12. And He said to me, Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, each man in his image room? For they are saying, The LORD does not see us; the LORD has forsaken the earth.

13. He also said to me, You turn again, [and] you shall see greater evils that they are doing.

14. And He brought me to the opening of the gate of the LORD's house, toward the north. And behold, women were sitting there, weeping for Tammuz.

15. And He said to me, Have you seen, O son of man? Turn yet again, [and] you shall see greater evils than these.

16. And He brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house, and behold, at the opening of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, [were] about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east; and they bowed themselves eastward to the sun.

17. And He said to me, Have you seen, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they do the hateful things which they do here? For they have filled the land with violence and have turned to provoke Me to anger. And lo, they put the branch to their nose.

18. And I will also deal with fury; My eye shall not spare, nor will I have pity. And though they cry in My ears [with] a loud voice, I will not hear them.

## Ezekiel 9

1. And He cried in my ears [with] a loud voice, saying, Let the overseers of the city draw near, even each [with] his destroying weapon in his hand.

2. And behold, six men came from the way of the Upper Gate which faces north, and each had his shattering weapon in his hand. And one man among them [was] clothed with linen, and a writer's inkhorn by his side. And they went in and stood beside the bronze altar.

3. And the glory of the God of Israel had gone on from the cherub, where it was on it, to the threshold of the house. And He called to the man clothed in linen, [with] the writer's inkhorn by his side.

4. And the LORD said to him, Go through in the midst of the city, in the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men who are groaning and are mourning because of all the abominations that are done in her midst.

5. And He said to those in my hearing, Go over in the city after him, and strike. Let not your eye spare, nor have pity.

6. Fully destroy old [men], young men and virgins, and little children and women. But do not come near any man on whom [is] the mark. And begin at My sanctuary. And they began at the old men who [were] before the house.

7. And He said to them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out! And they went out and killed in the city.

8. And it happened as they were slaying them, and I remained, then I fell on my face and cried, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! Will You destroy all the remnant of Israel in Your pouring out of Your fury on Jerusalem?

9. And He said to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah [is] great, and the land is full of blood, and the city is full of perversity. For they say, The LORD has forsaken the land; and, the LORD does not see.

10. And even I, My eye shall not spare, nor will I have pity, [but] I will put their way on their head.

11. And behold, the man clothed with linen, [with] the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as You have commanded me.

## Ezekiel 10

1. And I looked, and behold! In the expanse over the head of the cherubs appeared the look of the form of a throne, like a sapphire stone, above them.

2. And He spoke to the man clothed [with] linen, and said, Go in among the wheels, under the cherub, and fill your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubs, and scatter [them] on the city. And he went in before me.

3. And the cherubs were standing on the right side of the house when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.

4. And the glory of the LORD rose from the cherub, over the threshold of the house. And the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD's glory.

5. And the sound of the cherubs' wings was heard over the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when He speaks.

6. And it happened when He had commanded the man clothed [with] linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubs; he went in then and stood beside the wheels.

7. And a cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubs to the fire between the cherubs, and he lifted it and put [it] into the hands of the one clothed with linen. And he took [it] and went out.

8. And the form of a man's hand was seen under the wings of the cherubs.

9. And I looked, and behold, the four wheels [were] beside the cherubs, one wheel was by one cherub, and another wheel by one cherub; and the wheels looked like the color of a stone of Tarshish.

10. And their appearance was as one, the four of them, as if the wheel were in the midst of the wheel.

11. When they went, they went on their four sides. They did not turn as they went, for to the place where the head faces, after it they went. They did not turn as they went.

12. And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels [were] full of eyes all around, [even] their wheels that the four of them had.

13. As for the wheels, it was cried to them in my hearing, Whirling wheel!

14. And four faces were to each one. The first face [was] the face of a cherub, and the second face [was] the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.

15. And the cherubs rose up. This [is] the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.

16. And when the cherubs went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubs lifted their wings to soar from the earth, the wheels did not turn from beside them, even they.

17. When they stood still, [these] stood still, and when they rose up, [these] lifted up. For the spirit of the living creature [was] in them.

18. And the glory of the LORD went from the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubs.

19. And the cherubs lifted up their wings and rose up from the earth in my sight. When they went out, the wheels also [were] beside them. And he stood at the door of the eastern gate of the LORD's house. And the glory of the God of Israel [was] over them from above.

20. This [is] the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar, and I knew that they [were] cherubs.

21. Four, [even] four faces [are] to each; and four wings to each. And the form of a man's hands [was] under their wings.

22. And the form of their faces, they [are] the faces that I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances even theirs. They each went straight forward.

## Ezekiel 11

1. And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the eastern gate of the LORD's house, which faces eastward. And behold, twenty-five men were at the opening of the gate; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, rulers of the people.

2. And He said to me, Son of man, these [are] the men who plot evil and give wicked advice in this city;

3. who say, [It is] not near; let us build houses; this [city is] the pot, and we [are] the flesh.

4. Therefore prophesy against them. Prophesy, O son of man!

5. And the Spirit of the LORD fell on me, and said to me, Speak: So says the LORD: So you have said, O house of Israel, for I Myself know the elevations of your spirit.

6. You have multiplied your dead in this city, and you have filled its streets with the dead.

7. Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: Your slain whom you have laid in her midst, they [are] the flesh, and this [city is] the pot. But I will bring you out of her midst.

8. You have feared the sword, and I will bring a sword on you, says the Lord Jehovah.

9. And I will bring you out of her midst, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments on you.

10. You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you in the border of Israel, and you shall know that I [am] the LORD.

11. This [city] shall not be your pot, nor shall you be the flesh in her midst. But I will judge you in the border of Israel,

12. and you shall know that I [am] the LORD. For you have not walked in My statutes, nor have you done My judgments, but have done after the customs of the nations all around you.

13. And it happened when I prophesied, Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. And I fell on my face and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! Will You make a full end [of] the remnant of Israel?

14. Again the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

15. Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, the men of your redemption, and all the house of Israel, of all that have heard the inhabitants of Jerusalem saying to all of them, Go far away from Jehovah; this land is given to us for a possession.

16. Therefore say, So says the Lord Jehovah: Though I have sent them far off among the nations, and though I scattered them among the lands, yet I will be to them as a little sanctuary in the lands where they had gone.

17. Therefore say, So says the Lord Jehovah: I will even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the lands, in those where you were scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.

18. And they shall come there, and they shall take away all its hateful things and all its abominations from it.

19. And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. And I will remove the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh,

20. so that they may walk in My statutes and keep My ordinances, and do them. And they shall be My people, and I will be their God.

21. And [as] to [those whose] heart is going [after] their hateful things, and [also] their heart [is after] their disgusting idols, I will give their way on their own heads, says the Lord Jehovah.

22. And the cherubs lifted up their wings, and the wheels beside them. And the glory of the God of Israel [was] over them above.

23. And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city and stood on the mountain which [is] on the east side of the city.

24. And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to the exiles. And the vision that I had seen went up from me.

25. And I spoke to the exiles all the things that the LORD had shown me.

## Ezekiel 12

1. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, who have eyes to see and see not. They have ears to hear and hear not, for they [are] a rebellious house.

3. Therefore, son of man, prepare for yourself vessels for exile, and go into exile by day before their eyes. And you shall be exiled from your place to another place before their eyes. It may be they will consider, though they [are] a rebellious house.

4. And you shall bring out your vessels, as vessels for exile, by day before their eyes. And you shall go out at evening before their eyes, as those going into exile.

5. Dig through the wall before their eyes, and carry out through it.

6. Before their eyes you shall carry [it] on [your] shoulders, carry it out in the dark. You shall cover your face so that you do not see the ground, for I have set you as a sign to the house of Israel.

7. And I did as I was commanded. By day I brought out my vessel as a vessel for exile. And in the evening I dug by hand through the wall. I brought [it] out in the dark, and I carried it on [my] shoulder before their eyes.

8. And in the morning the Word of the LORD [came] to me, saying,

9. Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, What are you doing?

10. Say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: This burden [concerns] the king in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel among them.

11. Say, I [am] your sign: As I have done, so it shall be done to them. They shall go into exile, into captivity.

12. And the king who [is] among them shall carry [burdens] on [his] shoulder in the dark, and shall go out. They shall dig through the wall to carry out by it. He shall hide his face so that he does not see the ground with  his] eye.

13. I will also spread My net on him, and He shall be taken in My snare. And I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans. Yet he shall not see it, though he shall die there.

14. And I will scatter to every wind all who [are] around him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.

15. And they shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I shall scatter them among the nations and scatter them in the countries.

16. But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the plague, so that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they come. And they shall know that I [am] the LORD.

17. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

18. Son of man, eat your bread with quaking and drink your water with trembling and anxiety.

19. And say to the people of the land: So says the Lord Jehovah of the people of Jerusalem [and] of the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water with horror, so that her land may be desolated of her fullness, because of the violence of all those who dwell in it.

20. And the cities that have people shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD.

21. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

22. Son of man, what [is] this proverb [that] you have in the land of Israel, saying, The days will go on and every vision shall fail?

23. Therefore tell them, So says the Lord Jehovah: I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel. But say to them, The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision.

24. For there shall never again be any vain vision nor slippery divination within the house of Israel.

25. For I, the LORD, will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall be done. It shall no more be delayed; for in your days, O rebellious house, I will say the word and will do it, says the Lord Jehovah.

26. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

27. Son of man, behold, the house of Israel says, The vision that he sees [is] for many days to come, and he prophesies of the times that are far off.

28. Therefore say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: There shall none of my words be delayed any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, says the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 13

1. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy. And say to those who prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear the Word of Jehovah:

3. So says the Lord Jehovah, Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing!

4. O Israel, your prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.

5. You have not gone up into the breaks, nor built the wall for the house of Israel, that it might stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.

6. They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD says. And the LORD has not sent them; but they hoped to confirm [their] word.

7. Did you not see a vain vision, and speak a lying divination? Yet you say, The LORD says; although I have not spoken?

8. Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have spoken vanity and seen a lie, therefore, behold, I [am] against you, says the Lord Jehovah.

9. And My hand shall be against the prophets who see vanity and who divine a lie. They shall not be in the council of My people, nor shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter into the land of Israel. And you shall know that I [am] the Lord Jehovah.

10. Because, even because they made My people go astray, saying, Peace; and [there was] no peace; and he builds a wall, and lo, [others] daubed it with lime.

11. Say to those who daub [with] lime, yes, it shall fall; [there] will be a flooding rain; and you, O hailstones, shall fall, and a stormy wind will break.

12. And, behold, when the wall has fallen, shall it not be said to you, Where [is] the daubing with which you have daubed?

13. Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: I will even break [it with] a stormy wind in My fury. And there shall be an flooding rain in My anger, and hailstones in fury to destroy it.

14. And I will break down the wall that you have daubed [with] lime, and touch it to the ground; yea, I will bare its base. And it shall fall, and you shall be destroyed in her midst; and you shall know that I [am] the LORD.

15. And I will fulfill My wrath on the wall and on those who daubed it [with] lime. And I will say to you, The wall [is] no more; and, Those who daubed [are] no more;

16. the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her, and [there is] no peace, says the LORD.

17. And you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own heart. And prophesy against them,

18. and say, So says the Lord Jehovah: Woe to those sewing bands to all joints of my hands, and make long veils for the head of every [man] of stature, to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of My people, and will you save alive the souls for yourselves?

19. And will you profane Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to kill the souls that should not die; and to save alive the souls that should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies.

20. Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I [am] against your bands with which you are hunting the souls there, to make them fly. And I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, the souls which you are hunting, to make them fly.

21. Also I will tear your long veils and deliver My people out of your hand, and they shall no more be in your hand to be hunted. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD.

22. Because with lies you have saddened the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and have made the hands of the wicked strong, so that he should not turn from his wicked way, by promising him life;

23. therefore you shall not see vanity, and you shall not divine any divination. and I will deliver My people out of your hands; and you shall know that I [am] the LORD.

## Ezekiel 14

1. And some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me.

2. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

3. Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts, and put the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their face. Should I at all be inquired of by them?

4. Therefore speak to them, and say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: Every man of the house of Israel who sets up his idols in his heart, and puts the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him in it by the host of his idols;

5. so that I may capture the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are estranged from Me by their idols, all of them.

6. Therefore say to the house of Israel, So says the Lord Jehovah: Repent and turn from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations.

7. For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger who lives in Israel, who separates himself from Me and sets up his idols in his heart, and puts the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to a prophet to ask of him concerning Me; I the LORD will answer him Myself.

8. And I will set My face against that man, and I will make him desolate for a sign and for proverbs. And I will cut him off from the midst of My people; and you shall know that I [am] the LORD.

9. And the prophet, if he is deceived, and he speaks a word, I the LORD have deceived that prophet. And I will stretch out My hand on him and will destroy him in the midst of My people Israel.

10. And they shall bear their iniquity. As the iniquity of the inquirer, so the iniquity of the prophet shall be.

11. So that the house of Israel may never again go astray from Me, nor be defiled again with all their transgressions, but they are to Me My people, and I will be to them for God, says the Lord Jehovah.

12. The Word of the LORD came again to me, saying,

13. Son of man, when a land sins against Me by traitorous betraying, then I will stretch out My hand on it, and will break the staff of its bread, and will send famine on it, and will cut off man and beast from it.

14. And [though] these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver [only] their own souls by their righteousness, says the Lord Jehovah.

15. If I cause destroying beasts to come through the land, and they spoil it so that it is deserted, so that no one may pass through because of the beasts,

16. [though] these three men were in its midst, [as] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters. They only shall be delivered, but the land shall be deserted.

17. Or [if] I bring a sword on that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it;

18. though these three men [were] in it, [as] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they [only] shall be delivered themselves.

19. Or [if] I send a plague into that land, and pour out My fury on it in blood, to cut off man and beast from it;

20. though Noah, Daniel, and Job [were] in it, [as] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter. They shall [only] deliver their own souls by their righteousness.

21. For so says the Lord Jehovah: How much more when I send My four evil judgments on Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the destroying beast, and the plague, to cut off man and beast from it.

22. Yet, behold, there shall be left a remnant in it that shall be brought out, sons and daughters. Behold, they shall come out to you, and you shall see their way and their doings. And you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I brought on Jerusalem, [for] all that I have brought on it.

23. And they shall comfort you when you see their way and their doings. And you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, says the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 15

1. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, how is the vine tree more than any other tree, [or than] a branch which is among the trees of the forest?

3. Shall wood be taken from it to do work? Or will [men] take from it [for] a peg to hang any vessel on it?

4. Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel. The fire devours both its ends, and its middle is charred. Is it fit for [any] work?

5. Behold, when it was whole, it was not made for work. How much less when the fire has devoured it, and it is charred? Shall it yet be made to work?

6. Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah, As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give the people of Jerusalem.

7. And I will set My face against them; they shall go out from the fire, and the fire shall devour them. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD when I set My face against them.

8. And I will make the land [to be] desolate, because they have committed a treacherous act, says the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 16

1. Again the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations.

3. And say, So says the Lord Jehovah to Jerusalem, Your origin and your birth [is] of the land of Canaan. Your father was an Amorite, and your mother a Hittite.

4. And [as for] your birth, in the day you were born your navel was not cut, nor were you washed with water to cleanse [you]. And you were not salted, nor swaddled at all.

5. No eye pitied you, to do any of these to you, to have compassion on you. But you were thrown out into the open field, because your life was despised in the day that you were born.

6. And when I passed by you and saw you squirming in your blood, I said to you in your blood, Live! Yes, I said to you in your blood, Live!

7. I have caused you to multiply like the bud of the field, and you are grown, and you are great; and you come [in] the finest ornaments. [Your] breasts are formed, and hair is grown, yet you [were] naked and bare.

8. And I passed by you and looked on you, and, behold, your time [was] the time of love. And I spread my skirt over you and covered your nakedness. And I swore to you and entered into a covenant with you, says the Lord Jehovah. And you became Mine.

9. And I washed you with water; I washed away your blood from you, and I anointed you with oil.

10. I also clothed you [with] embroidered work, and I shod you [with] dugong [sandals]. And I wrapped you in fine linen, and I covered you [with] silk.

11. And I adorned you [with] ornaments, and I put bracelets on your hands and a chain on your neck.

12. And I put a ring on your nose, and earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.

13. And you were adorned with gold and silver; and your clothing [was of] fine linen and silk and embroidered work. You ate fine flour and honey and oil; and you were exceedingly beautiful. And you advanced to regal estate.

14. And your name went out among the nations, because of your beauty; for it [was] perfect in My beauty, which I had put on you, says the Lord Jehovah.

15. But you trusted in your beauty, and played the harlot because of your name, and poured out your fornications on all who passed by; it was his.

16. And you took from your clothes and adorned your high places with different colors, and fornicated on them, [such as] had not come, nor shall be.

17. And you have taken beautiful things of My gold and of My silver, which I had given you, and made images of males, and fornicated with them.

18. And [you] took your embroidered dresses and covered them, and you have given to their face My oil and My incense.

19. Also My food which I gave you, fine flour and oil and honey [with which] I fed you, you have given it to their face for a soothing aroma. And it happened, says the Lord Jehovah.

20. And you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne to Me, and you gave these to them for food. [Are] your fornications small?

21. You have slaughtered My sons and gave them to cause these to pass through [the fire] for them.

22. And in all your hateful deeds and your fornications you have not remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, [and] squirming in your blood.

23. Woe, woe to you says the Lord Jehovah! [For] it happened after all your evil,

24. [that] you have also built yourself a mound, and you have made yourself a high place in every street.

25. You have built your high place at the head of every way, and have made your beauty to be despised, and have opened your feet to everyone who passed by, and have multiplied your fornications.

26. You have also whored with the Egyptians, your neighbors great of flesh, and have multiplied your fornications to provoke Me to anger.

27. And, behold, therefore I have stretched out My hand over you, and drew back your portion. And I gave you to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your wicked way.

28. You have whored with the Assyrians, without your being satisfied; yea, you whored and yet you were not satisfied.

29. And your whoredom is idolatry in the land of Canaan, [to the] Chaldean, and yet you were not satisfied with this.

30. How weak is your heart, says the Lord Jehovah, since you do all these, the work of a woman, an overbearing harlot;

31. in that you build your mound at the head of every way, and make your high place in every street. Yet you have not been as a harlot, scorning wages.

32. [Like] the adulterous wife, instead of her husband, she takes strangers.

33. They give a gift to all harlots, but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and bribe them to come to you from all around, for your fornication.

34. And in you was the opposite from [those] women in your fornications, since no one whores after you, and in your giving wages, and hire is not given to you. [In] this you are opposite.

35. Therefore, O harlot, hear the Word of the LORD.

36. So says the Lord Jehovah: Because your lewdness was poured out and your nakedness was bared in your fornications with your lovers, and with all the idols of your abominations, and by the blood of your sons whom you gave to them;

37. behold, therefore I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have been pleased, even all [whom] you loved, with all whom you have hated; I will even gather them against you from all around, and will uncover your nakedness to them, and they will see all your nakedness.

38. And I will judge you with judgments of adulteresses, and with shedders of blood. And I will give you blood and fury and jealousy.

39. And I will also give you into their hand, and they will tear down your mound, and will demolish your high places. They shall also strip you of your clothes, and shall take your beautiful things, and leave you naked and bare.

40. They shall also raise a company against you, and they shall stone you with stones, and cut you with their swords.

41. And they shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women. And I will make you stop whoring; and also, you shall not give hire again.

42. And I will make My fury to rest against you, and My jealousy shall depart from you, and I will be quiet and will be angry no more.

43. Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have troubled Me in all these [things]; so, behold, I will also repay your way on [your] head, says the Lord Jehovah. And you shall not commit this wickedness above all your abominations.

44. Behold, all who use proverbs shall use [this] proverb against you, saying, As the mother, [so is] her daughter.

45. You [are] your mother's daughter, who despises her husband and her sons. And you [are] the sister of your sisters, who despise their husbands and their sons. Your mother [was] a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.

46. And your older sister [is] Samaria, she and her daughters who dwell at your left hand. And your younger sister, who dwells at your right hand, [is] Sodom and her daughters.

47. Yet you have not walked according to their ways, nor done according to their hateful deeds; but, as [if it were] a very little [thing], you were corrupted more than they were in all your ways.

48. [As] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, Sodom your sister, she nor her daughters, has not done as you have done, you and your daughters.

49. Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom; pride. Fullness of bread and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters. Nor did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.

50. And they were haughty and did abominable things before Me, so I turned away as I saw [fit].

51. Nor has Samaria sinned [as much] as half your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters in all your abominations which you have done.

52. You also, who have judged your sisters, bear your own shame for your sins which you have committed more abominable than they. They are more righteous than you! Yes, blush and bear your shame, since you have justified your sisters.

53. When I shall return their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then [also] the captivity of your captivity in their midst;

54. that you may bear your shame, and blush in all that you have done, since you are a comfort to them.

55. When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former state, then you and your daughters shall return to your former state.

56. For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride,

57. before your wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of [your] reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all her neighbors, the daughters of the Philistines who hated you from all around.

58. You are bearing your wickedness and your abominations, says the LORD.

59. For so says the Lord Jehovah: I will even deal with you as you have done, who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant.

60. But I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish to you an everlasting covenant.

61. And you shall remember your ways and be ashamed, when you shall receive your sisters, your older and your younger. And I will give them to you for daughters, but not by [your] covenant.

62. And I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall know that I [am] the LORD;

63. so that you may remember and be ashamed; and it will not be [possible] to open [your] mouth any more because of your shame; in that I am propitiated for all that you have done, says the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 17

1. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, put out a riddle and speak a parable to the house of Israel.

3. And say, So says the Lord Jehovah: A great eagle with great wings, long of pinion, full of feathers, who had different colors, came to Lebanon and took the highest branch of the cedar.

4. He plucked off the top of its young twigs and carried it into a land of traders. He set it in a city of merchants.

5. He also took of the seed of the land and planted it in a fruitful field. He placed [it] by great waters and set [it] as a willow tree.

6. And it grew and became a spreading low vine, whose branches turned toward him. And its roots were under him. So it became a vine and brought out branches and shot out boughs.

7. There was also another great eagle [with] great wings and many feathers. And behold, this vine bent its roots toward him and shot out its branches toward him, that he might water it, away from the beds of its planting.

8. It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring out branches, and that it might bear fruit, to be a splendid vine.

9. Say, So says the Lord Jehovah: Shall it prosper? Shall he not pull up its roots and cut off its fruit, and wither it? All the leaves of its sprouting shall wither, and not with great arm, nor by many people [shall any] raise it by its roots.

10. And behold, [being] planted, shall it prosper? Shall it not utterly wither when the east wind touches it? It shall wither in the beds [where] it sprouted.

11. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

12. Say now to the rebellious house: Do you not know what these [things mean]? Tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon has come to Jerusalem and has taken its king and its rulers, and brings them to himself to Babylon.

13. And he has taken of the king's seed and has made a covenant with him, and has taken an oath from him. He has also taken the mighty of the land,

14. so that the kingdom might be low, that it might not lift itself up, [but] that by keeping his covenant it might stand.

15. But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, to give him horses and many people. Shall he be blessed? Shall he who does such [things] escape? Or shall he break the covenant and be delivered?

16. [As] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, surely in the place of the king who made him king, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.

17. Nor shall Pharaoh with [his] mighty army and great company work for him in the war, by pouring out siege mounds and building forts, to cut off many persons.

18. And he has despised the oath by breaking the covenant. And, behold, he had given his hand, and has done all these, he shall not escape.

19. Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: [As] I live, surely My oath that he has despised, and My covenant that he has broken, I will even repay it on his own head.

20. And I will spread My net on him, and he shall be taken in My snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and I will judge him there with his sin which he has sinned against Me.

21. And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and those who remain shall be scattered toward all winds. And you shall know that I the LORD have spoken.

22. So says the Lord Jehovah: I, [even] I, will also take of the top of the highest cedar and will set [it]; I will crop off from the first of its young twigs a tender one, and will plant it on a high and lofty mountain.

23. In a mountain, in a high place of Israel, I will plant it. And it shall bear boughs, and bear fruit, and be a majestic cedar. And under it shall dwell every bird of every wing; in the shadow of its branches they shall dwell.

24. And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish. I the LORD have spoken and acted.

## Ezekiel 18

1. The Word of the LORD came to me again, saying,

2. What is it to you that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes and the teeth of the sons [are] dull?

3. [As] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, to you there is no longer any [occasion] to use this proverb in Israel.

4. Behold, all souls [are] Mine. As the soul of the father, also the soul of the son, they [are] Mine. The soul that sins, it shall die.

5. But a man that is just and does what is just and right,

6. and has not eaten on the mountains, nor has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, nor has defiled his neighbor's wife, nor has come near a menstruating woman,

7. and has not ill-treated any man, [but] has given the debtor's pledge back to him, has robbed none by violence, has given his bread to the hungry and has covered the naked with a garment;

8. he has not given out on usury, nor has taken any increase, he has withdrawn his hand from iniquity, has done judgment between man and man,

9. has walked in My statutes, and has kept My judgments to deal truly, he [is] righteous, he shall surely live, says the Lord Jehovah.

10. And if he fathers a son [who is] violent, who sheds blood, and who does to a brother [any] of these;

11. even if he does do not any of these himself, but his son] has, but has even eaten on the mountains, and has defiled his neighbor's wife;

12. has ill-treated the poor and needy; thieving, he stole; has not given back the pledge; and has lifted up his eyes to the idols; has committed abomination;

13. has loaned on usury; and has taken increase; shall he then live? He shall not live! He has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be on him.

14. And, lo, [if] he fathers a son who sees all his father's sins which he has done, and fears, and does not do like him;

15. [who] has not eaten on the mountains; nor has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel; has not defiled his neighbor's wife;

16. nor has ill-treated any man; has not withheld the pledge; nor has robbed by violence; [but] has given his bread to the hungry; and has covered the naked [with] clothes;

17. has withdrawn his hand from the poor; has not received usury nor increase; has done My judgments; has walked in My statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father; he shall surely live.

18. His father, because he extorted, robbed [his] brother by robbery, and did [what is] not good among his people; lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.

19. Yet you say, Why? Does not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son has done justice and right, has kept all My statutes, and has done them, he shall surely live.

20. The soul that sins, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, nor shall the father bear the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be on him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be on him.

21. But if the wicked will turn from all his sins which he has committed, and keep all My statutes, and do justice and right, he shall surely live; he shall not die.

22. All his transgressions that he has done, they shall not be mentioned to him; in his righteousness that he has done he shall live.

23. Do I actually delight in the death of the wicked? says the Lord Jehovah. Is it not that he should turn from his ways and live?

24. But when the righteous turns from his righteousness and does injustice, [and] does according to all the abominations that the wicked do, shall he live? All his righteousness that he has done shall not be remembered; in his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that he has sinned, in them he shall die.

25. Yet you say, The way of the LORD is not fair. Hear now, O house of Israel: Is not My way fair? Are your ways not unfair?

26. When a righteous one turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity and dies in them; for his iniquity that he has done, he shall die.

27. Again, when the wicked turns away from his wickedness that he has committed and does that which is lawful and righteous, he shall save his soul alive.

28. Because he looks carefully, and turns away from all his sins that he has committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die.

29. Yet says the house of Israel: The way of the LORD is not fair. O house of Israel, are not My ways fair? Are not your ways unfair?

30. So I will judge you, O house of Israel, each one of you according to his ways, says the Lord Jehovah. Turn and be made to turn from all your sins; and iniquity shall not be your stumbling-block.

31. Cast away from you all your sins by which you have sinned; and make you a new heart and a new spirit; for why will you die, O house of Israel?

32. For I have no delight in the death of him who dies, says the Lord Jehovah. Therefore turn and live.

## Ezekiel 19

1. And take up a weeping for the rulers of Israel,

2. and say: What [is] your mother? A lioness. She lay down among lions; she multiplied her cubs among young lions.

3. And she brought up one of her cubs; it became a strong lion and learned to tear the prey. It ate men.

4. The nations also heard of him. He was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains to the land of Egypt.

5. And when she saw that she had waited [and] that her hope was lost, she took another of her cubs and made him a strong lion.

6. And he went up and down among the lions; he became a young lion and learned to tear the prey, [and] ate men.

7. And he knew his widows, and he laid their cities waste, and the land and its fullness was desolated, from the sound of his roaring.

8. And the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him. He was taken in their pit.

9. And they put him in a cage in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon. They brought him into hunting nets, so that his voice should never again be heard on the mountains of Israel.

10. Your mother [is] like a vine in your blood, planted by the waters; she was fruitful and full of branches because of many waters.

11. And she [had] strong rods for the scepters of those who bore rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches; and it was seen in her height, with the multitude of her branches.

12. But she was plucked up in fury; she was thrown down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit. Her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire burned them up.

13. And now she [is] planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground.

14. And fire has gone out from a rod of her branches, [which] has licked up her fruit so that there is no strong rod in her to be a scepter to rule. This is a mourning and [shall be] for a mourning.

## Ezekiel 20

1. And it happened in the seventh year, in the fifth [month], the tenth of the month, some of the elders of Israel came to ask of the LORD, and sat before me.

2. And came the Word of the LORD to me, saying,

3. Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: Have you come to ask of Me? [As] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.

4. Will you judge [them], son of man, will you judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers.

5. And say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: In the day that I chose Israel, and lifted up My hand to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt; when I lifted up My hand to them, saying, I [am] Jehovah your God;

6. in the day [that] I lifted up My hand to them, to bring them out from the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing [with] milk and honey, which [is] the glory of all lands;

7. then I said to them, Let each man throw away the abominations of his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I [am] Jehovah your God.

8. But they rebelled against Me and would not listen to Me. They did not each man throw away the abominations of their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. And I said, I will pour out My fury against them to fulfill My anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.

9. But I worked for My name's sake, that it should not be profaned before the nations among whom they [were, for] I made Myself known to them in their eyes, by bringing them out of the land of Egypt.

10. And I caused them to go out from the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.

11. And I gave them My statutes and showed them My judgments, which [if] a man do, he shall even live in them.

12. And also I gave them My sabbaths to be a sign between Me and them, that [they] might know that I [am] the LORD who sets them apart.

13. But the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness; they did not walk in My statutes, and they despised My judgments, which [if] a man does, he shall even live in them. And they greatly profaned My sabbaths. And I said,  I] will pour out My fury on them in the wilderness to destroy them.

14. But I worked for My name's sake, so that it should not be profaned before the nations in whose sight I brought them out.

15. And also I lifted up My hand to them in the wilderness, that [I] would not bring them into the land which I had given [them], flowing [with] milk and honey; it [is] the glory of all lands;

16. because they despised My judgments and walked not in My sabbaths; and they profaned My sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols.

17. But My eye spared them from destroying them, nor did I make an end of them in the wilderness.

18. But I said to their sons in the wilderness, Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, nor observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols.

19. I [am] Jehovah your God. Walk in My statutes, and keep My judgments, and do them,

20. and keep My sabbaths holy; and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that you may know that I [am] Jehovah your God.

21. But the sons rebelled against Me. They did not walk in My statutes, nor kept My judgments to do them; the judgments which, [if] a man do, he shall even live in them; they profaned My sabbaths and I said [I] would pour out My fury on them, to fulfill My anger against them in the wilderness.

22. But I withdrew My hand and worked for My name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations, from whom I brought them out in their eyes.

23. I also lifted up My hand to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations and scatter them through the lands,

24. because they had not done My judgments, but had despised My sabbaths and had profaned My sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols.

25. Also I gave them statutes not good, and judgments by which they should not live.

26. And I defiled them in their own gifts, in that they caused all that open the womb to pass through [the fire], that I might waste them, to the end that they might know that I [am] the LORD.

27. Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed Me, in that they have committed a sin against Me.

28. When I had brought them into the land [for] which I lifted up My hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered their sacrifices there. And there they offered their provoking gifts. There also they made their sweet aroma, and poured out their drink offerings there.

29. And I said to them, What [is] the high place to which you go? And the name of it is called High Place to this day.

30. Therefore say to the house of Israel, So says the Lord Jehovah: Are you defiled in the same way as your fathers? And do you go whoring after their abominations?

31. For when you offer your gifts, when you make your sons to pass through the fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols, even to [this] day. And shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? [As] I Live, says the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.

32. And what comes up on your spirit shall not happen at all, that you say, We will be like the nations, like the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.

33. [As] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, I will reign over you.

34. And I will bring you out from the people, and I will gather you out of the lands in which you are scattered among them, with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out.

35. And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face.

36. Just as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you, says the Lord Jehovah.

37. And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.

38. And I will purge out from among you the rebels and those who sin against Me. I will bring them out from the land where they reside, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD.

39. And you, O house of Israel, so says the Lord Jehovah: [Every] man go and serve his idols, and do so from now on if you will not listen to Me. But never again defile My holy name with your gifts and with your idols.

40. For in My holy mountain, in the mountain height [of] Israel, says the Lord Jehovah, there all the house of Israel, all of those in the land, shall serve Me. There will I receive them, and there will I ask for your offerings and the firstfruits of your offerings, with all your holy things.

41. I will receive you with your sweet aroma when I bring you out from the people and gather you out of the lands into which you have been scattered among them. And I will be sanctified in you in the eyes of the nations.

42. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the land [for] which I lifted up My hand, to give it to your fathers.

43. And there you shall remember your ways and all your doings in which you have been defiled. And you shall despise yourselves in your own sight for all your evils which you have committed.

44. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD when I have worked with you for My name's sake, not according to your wicked ways nor according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah.

45. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

46. Son of man, set your face toward the south, and drop a [word] toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field.

47. And say to the forest of the south, Hear the Word of the LORD. So says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall burn up every green tree in you, and every dry tree among you. The flaming flame shall not be put out, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned in it.

48. And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it. It shall not be put out.

49. And I said, Ah Lord Jehovah! They say of me, Does he not speak parables?

## Ezekiel 21

1. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and drop [a word] toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel.

3. And say to the land of Israel, So says the LORD: Behold, I [am] against you, and will draw out My sword out of its sheath and will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked.

4. Since then I will cut off the righteous and the wicked from you, therefore My sword shall be drawn from its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north,

5. so that all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn out My sword from its sheath. It shall not return any more.

6. And you, son of man, groan with the breaking of [your] loins; and groan with bitterness before their eyes.

7. And it will be when they say to you, Why do you groan? You shall answer, Because of the news [that] it is coming; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak  as] water. Behold, it comes, and it shall be, says the Lord Jehovah.

8. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

9. Son of man, prophesy and say, So says the LORD. Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened and also polished.

10. It is sharpened in order to slaughter; it is polished so that there may be a flash to it. Or shall we rejoice? You are despising the rod of My son, [as if it were] every tree.

11. And He has given it to be polished, to be taken by the hand. The sword, it is sharpened, and it it polished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.

12. Cry and howl, son of man; for it [shall be] on My people; it [shall be] on all the rulers of Israel. They are thrown to the sword with My people; Therefore slap [your] thigh.

13. Because [it is] a trial, and what if even the despising rod shall not be? says the Lord Jehovah.

14. And you, son of man, prophesy and strike [your] hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain. It [is] the sword of the slain, the great one that surrounds them;

15. so that [their] heart may melt, and many stumble at all [their] gates. I have given the threatening sword. Ah! It is made like lightning; it is wrapped for a slaughter.

16. Sharpen yourself on the right! Set yourself on the left, wherever your face is set.

17. And also I, I will also strike My hands together, and I will cause My fury to rest. I the LORD have spoken.

18. The Word of the LORD came to me again, saying,

19. And you, son of man, set for yourself two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come. Both of them shall come out of one land. And create a hand at the head of the way to the city; create it.

20. You shall set a way that the sword may enter [into] Rabbah of the Ammonites, and [into] Judah, into fortified Jerusalem.

21. For the king of Babylon shall stand at the parting of the way, at the head of the two highways, to practice divination. He shall shake arrows; he shall ask household idols; he shall look at the liver.

22. At his right shall be the divining [for] Jerusalem, to set [battering] rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering-rams against the gates, to pour out and to build a siege wall.

23. And it shall be to them an empty divining before their eyes, those who have sworn oaths to them. But He will remember iniquity, that they may be taken.

24. So the Lord Jehovah says this: Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, in that your sins are revealed in all your deeds; because you have been remembered, you shall be taken with the hand.

25. And you, O slain, wicked king of Israel, of whom has come his day in the time of iniquity of the end.

26. So says the Lord Jehovah: Remove the diadem, and take off the crown. This [shall] not [be] as it was. Lift up the low one, and put down the high one.

27. Ruin, ruin, ruin, I will appoint it. Also this shall not be until the coming of Him whose is the right. And I will give it to Him.

28. And you, son of man, prophesy and say, So says the Lord Jehovah concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their shame. Even say: The sword, the sword [is] drawn, polished for slaughter to make an end, that [it may be] like lightning;

29. while they see false visions for you, while they divine a lie to you, to put you on the necks of the slain of the wicked whose day has come in the day of iniquity; [it shall have] an end.

30. Return it to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I will judge you.

31. And I will pour out My disgust on you; with the fire of My wrath I will blow against you, and give you into the hand of burning men, able to destroy.

32. You shall be for food to the fire. Your blood shall be in the midst of the land. You shall be remembered no [more]; for I the LORD have spoken.

## Ezekiel 22

1. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

2. And you, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? And you shall make her know all her abominations.

3. And you shall say, So says the Lord Jehovah: The city sheds blood in her midst that her time may come, and makes idols against herself to defile [herself].

4. You are guilty in your blood that you have shed; and you have defiled yourself in your idols you have made. And your days [are] brought near, and have come to your years. Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mocking to all lands.

5. [Those who are] near and [those] far from you shall mock against you, O defiled of name, abounding in tumult.

6. Behold, the rulers of Israel, each man by his might, have been in you in order to shed blood.

7. In you they have despised father and mother. In your midst they have dealt with the stranger by oppression. In you they oppressed the orphan and the widow.

8. You have despised My holy things, and have profaned My sabbaths.

9. In you are men of slander to shed blood; and in you they eat on the mountains; in your midst they do unchaste acts.

10. In you they have uncovered their fathers' nakedness; in you they have humbled her defiled by impurity.

11. And a man has done abomination with his neighbor's wife; and a man has defiled his daughter-in-law in unchaste acts; and a man has humbled within you his sister, his father's daughter.

12. In you they have taken bribes to shed blood. You have taken usury and increase, and you gained by extortion of your neighbors, and you have forgotten Me, says the Lord Jehovah.

13. And behold, I have struck My palm against your unjust gain which you have made, and at your blood which has been in your midst.

14. Can your heart stand, or can your hands be strong, in the day that I shall deal with you? I the LORD have spoken, and [I] will act.

15. And I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you in the lands, and will destroy your uncleanness out of you.

16. And you will be profaned in you before the eyes of the nations, and you shall know that I [am] the LORD.

17. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

18. Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to Me. All of them [are] bronze, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the middle of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver.

19. Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the middle of Jerusalem.

20. [As they] gather silver, and bronze, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the middle of the furnace, to blow the fire on it to melt [it], so I will gather [you] in My anger and in My fury, and I will leave [you there] and melt you.

21. And I will gather you and blow on you in the fire of My wrath, and you shall be melted in the middle of it.

22. As silver is melted in the middle of the furnace, so you shall be melted in the middle of it; and you shall know that I the LORD have poured out My fury on you.

23. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

24. Son of man, say to her: You [are] a land not being cleansed, nor rained on in the day of disgust.

25. A plot [by] her prophets [is] in her midst, like a roaring lion tearing the prey. They have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they multiplied her many widows in her midst.

26. Her priests have broken My law and have defiled My holy things. They have put no difference between the holy and the common, and have not taught between the unclean and the clean, and have hidden their eyes from My sabbaths, and I am defiled among them.

27. Her rulers in her midst [are] like wolves tearing the prey, to shed blood and to destroy souls, to get unjust gain.

28. And her prophets have daubed themselves [with] lime, seeing vanity and divining lies to them, saying, So says the Lord Jehovah; when the LORD has not spoken.

29. The people of the land have used oppression and practiced robbery, and they have troubled the poor and needy. Yea, [they] have oppressed the stranger without right.

30. And I sought for a man among them who should wall up a wall for the land, and stand in the break before me, that I should not destroy it. But I did not find one.

31. Therefore I have poured out My fury on them. I have burned them up with the fire of My wrath. I have given their way on their heads, says the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 23

1. The Word of the LORD came again to me,

2. Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother.

3. And they fornicated in Egypt; they whored in their youth, their breasts were handled, and there their virgin nipples were worked.

4. And their names [were] Oholah, the oldest, and Oholibah, her sister. And they were Mine, and they bore sons and daughters. And their names: Samaria [is] Oholah, and Jerusalem [is] Oholibah.

5. And Oholah whored under Me. And she lusted after her lovers, to [her] Assyrian neighbors,

6. clothed with purple, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding horses.

7. So she bestowed her harlotries on them, the choice sons of Assyria; [with] all of them, and with all whom she lusted after; she defiled herself with all their idols.

8. Nor did she leave her fornications from Egypt. For in her youth they lay with her, and they worked her virgin nipples, and poured their fornications on her.

9. Therefore I have given her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians on whom she lusted.

10. They uncovered her nakedness. They took her sons and her daughters and killed her with the sword. And she became notorious among women, and they executed judgment on her.

11. And her sister Oholibah saw, she was more corrupt in her lustfulness than she, and her fornications were greater than her sister's whoredom.

12. She lusted to the sons of Assyria, governors and rulers nearby, clothed most perfectly; horsemen riding horses, all of them desirable young men.

13. And I saw that she was defiled, one way [was] to both of them.

14. And she added to her fornications. And she saw men carved on the wall; images of the Chaldeans engraved with vermilion,

15. girded with girdles on their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like rulers, like the sons of Babylon [in] Chaldea, the land of their birth;

16. and she lusted after them, to the look of her eyes, and sent messengers to them into Chaldea.

17. And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with fornications. And she was defiled with them, and her mind was alienated from them.

18. So she uncovered her fornications and uncovered her nakedness. And My soul was alienated from her just as My soul was alienated from her sister.

19. Yet she multiplied her fornications to recall the days of her youth, in which she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.

20. And she lusted on her lovers, whose flesh is like the flesh of asses and whose issue [is like] the issue of horses.

21. So you longed for the wickedness of your youth, when the Egyptians worked your nipples, for the sake of the breasts of your youth.

22. So, O Oholibah, the Lord Jehovah says this: Behold, I will raise up against you your lovers, from whom your soul is alienated; and I will bring them against you from all around;

23. the Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, [and] all the Assyrians with them; all of them desirable young men, governors and rulers, all of them, third heads and called ones; all of them riding on horses.

24. And they shall come against you [with] weapons, chariots, and wheels, and with an assembly of peoples; buckler and shield and helmet shall set against you all around. And I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge you by their judgments.

25. And I will set My jealousy against you, and they shall deal with you in fury. They shall take away your nose and your ears, and the rest of you shall fall by the sword. They shall take away your sons and your daughters, and the rest of you shall be devoured by the fire.

26. They shall also strip you [of] your clothes and take away your beautiful jewels.

27. So I will make your wickedness to cease from you, and your fornication from the land of Egypt. And you shall not lift up your eyes to them, nor shall you remember Egypt any more.

28. For so says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will give you into the hand of [those] whom you hate, into the hand of whom your soul was alienated, from them.

29. And they shall deal with you in hatred, and shall take away all your labor, and shall leave you naked and bare. And the nakedness of your fornications shall be uncovered, both your wickedness and your fornications.

30. These [things] will be done to you because you have whored after the nations, and because you are defiled with their idols.

31. You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.

32. So says the Lord Jehovah: You shall drink of your sister's cup deep and large; you shall be laughed to scorn and mocked; for it holds much.

33. [In] drunkenness and sorrow you are filled, the cup of horror and ruin, the cup of your sister Samaria.

34. You shall even drink it and empty it. And you shall break its pieces, and tear off your own breasts. For I have spoken, says the Lord Jehovah.

35. So the Lord Jehovah says this: Because you have forgotten Me and cast Me behind your back, therefore bear also your wickedness and your adulteries.

36. And the LORD said to me: Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah, and declare to them their abominations,

37. that they have committed adultery, and blood [is] on their hands? And they have committed adultery with their idols and have also caused their sons whom they bore to Me to pass through the fire to them, to devour them.

38. And yet they have done this to Me: They have defiled My sanctuary in that day, and have profaned My sabbaths.

39. And when they had slain their sons to their idols, then they came into My sanctuary in that day to profane it. And lo, this they have done in the midst of My house.

40. And they have even sent for men to come from far, to whom a messenger [was] sent. And lo, they came. You washed yourself for them, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with ornaments,

41. and sat on a stately bed with a table prepared before it, on which you set My incense and My oil.

42. And the sound of a crowd [was] at ease with her; and drunkards from the wilderness were brought with the men of the host of mankind; and they put bracelets on their hands, and crowns of beauty on their heads.

43. And I said about the one worn [in] adulteries, Will they now whore with her, and she [with them] ?

44. And they went in to her, as [they] go in to a woman of harlotry; so they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the wicked women.

45. And [as] righteous men, they shall judge them [with] the judgment of adulteresses, and the judgment of women who shed blood; because they [are] adulteresses, and blood [is] in their hands.

46. For so says the Lord Jehovah: I will bring up a company on them, and will give them to be removed and stripped.

47. And the company shall stone them [with] stones, and cut them down with their swords. They shall kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.

48. So I will cause wickedness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught, even not to go after your wickedness.

49. And they shall put your wickedness on you, and you shall bear the sins of your idols. And you shall know that I [am] the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 24

1. Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth of the month, the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, write for yourself the name of the day, even of this same day. The king of Babylon has leaned toward Jerusalem this same day.

3. And speak a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: Set on a pot; set [it] on, and also pour water into it.

4. Gather its pieces into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder. Fill [it with] the choice bones.

5. Take the choice of the flock, and also burn the bones under it; make it boil high, and let them boil its bones in it.

6. So the Lord Jehovah says this: Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum [is] in it, and whose scum has not gone out of it! Bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall on it.

7. For her blood is in her midst; she set it on the top of a rock. She did not pour it on the ground, to cover it [with] dust,

8. that it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance. I have set her blood on a shining rock, that it should not be covered.

9. So the Lord Jehovah says this: Woe to the bloody city! I will even heap on the pile.

10. And heap on the wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and mix in the spice, and let the bones be burned.

11. And set it empty on its coals, so that its bronze may be hot and may glow, and [that] its uncleanness may be melted in it, [that] the scum of it may be burned away.

12. She has wearied [herself] with lies, and her great scum did not go out from her. Her scum [shall be] in the fire.

13. In your defilement [is] wickedness. Because I have purged you and you were not purged, you shall not be purged from your defilement any more, until I have caused My fury to cease on you.

14. I the LORD have spoken. It shall come, and I will do [it]. I will not let go, nor will I spare, nor will I repent. According to your ways, and according to your doings, they shall judge you, says the Lord Jehovah.

15. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

16. Son of man, behold, I take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke. Yet neither shall you mourn nor weep, nor shall your tears run down.

17. Groan [but] be silent; make no mourning [for] the dead; tie your turban on you, and put your sandals on your feet, and do not cover [your] lips, and do not eat the bread of men.

18. So I spoke to the people in the morning. And in the evening my wife died, and I did in the morning as I was commanded.

19. And the people said to me, Will you not tell us what these [things mean] to us, that you do so?

20. And I answered them, The Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

21. Speak to the house of Israel. So says the Lord Jehovah: behold, I will defile My sanctuary, the glory of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities. And your sons and your daughters whom you have left shall fall by the sword.

22. And you shall do as I have done. You shall not cover your lips nor eat the bread of men.

23. And your turbans [shall be] on your heads, and your sandals on your feet. You shall not mourn nor weep; but you shall pine away for your iniquities and mourn to one another.

24. So Ezekiel is a sign to you. According to all that he has done, you shall do. And when this comes, you shall know that I [am] the Lord Jehovah.

25. Also, son of man, [will it] not [be] in the day [when] I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that on which they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,

26. [that] he who escapes in that day shall come to you to cause [you] to hear it [with your] ears?

27. In that day your mouth shall be open to him who has escaped, and you shall speak and be no more dumb. And you shall be a sign to them, and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.

## Ezekiel 25

1. The Word of the LORD came again to me, saying,

2. Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites and prophesy against them.

3. And say to the Ammonites, Hear the Word of the Lord Jehovah. So says the Lord Jehovah: Because you said, Aha, against My sanctuary when it was defiled, and against the land of Israel when it was ruined, and against the house of Judah when they went into captivity;

4. therefore, behold, I will give you to the sons of the east for a possession. And they shall set their camp sites among you, and put among you their dwellings. They shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk.

5. And I will make Rabbah a pasture [for] camels, and the Ammonites a crouching-place [for] flocks. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD.

6. For so says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have clapped [your] hands and stamped the foot, and rejoiced in heart with all your spite against the land of Israel;

7. behold, therefore I will stretch out My hand on you, and will give you as a prize to the nations. And I will cut you off from the peoples, and I will cause you to perish out of the lands. I will destroy you, and you shall know that I [am the LORD.

8. So says the Lord Jehovah: Because Moab and Seir say, Behold, the house of Judah [is] like all the nations;

9. therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities, from his borders, the glory of the land, even Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim,

10. to the men of the east with the Ammonites. And I will give them in possession so that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.

11. And I will execute judgments on Moab; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.

12. So says the Lord Jehovah: Because Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has greatly offended and revenged himself on them;

13. therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: I will also stretch out My hand on Edom, and will cut man and beast off from it; and I will make it a waste from Teman, even to Dedan they shall fall by the sword.

14. And I will lay My vengeance on Edom by the hand of My people Israel. And they shall do in Edom according to My anger and according to My fury. And they shall know My vengeance, says the Lord Jehovah.

15. So says the Lord Jehovah: Because the Philistines have taken vengeance; yes, have taken vengeance with spite in [their] soul, to destroy [with] never-ending enmity,

16. So the Lord Jehovah says this: Behold, I will stretch out My hand on the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and will destroy the rest of the sea coast.

17. And I will execute great vengeance on them with rebukes; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I shall lay My vengeance on them.

## Ezekiel 26

1. And it happened in the eleventh year, in the first of the month, the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, because Tyre has said against Jerusalem, Aha! She is shattered, the doors of the peoples, she has turned to me; I shall be filled; she is laid waste.

3. So the Lord Jehovah says this: Behold, I [am] against you, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against you, [as] the sea causes its waves to come up.

4. And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers. I will also scrape her dust from her and make her like a shining rock.

5. It shall be a spreading place of nets in the middle of the sea. For I have spoken, says the Lord Jehovah. And it shall become a spoil to the nations.

6. And her daughters who [are] in the field shall be killed by the sword; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.

7. For so says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon on Tyre, a king of kings from the north, with horses and with chariots and with a company of horsemen, and many people.

8. He shall kill your daughters with the sword in the field. And he shall make siege walls against you, and pour out a siege mound against you, and lift up the shield against you.

9. And he shall set engines of war against your walls, and with his axes he shall break down your towers.

10. Because of his many horses, their dust shall cover you. Your walls shall shake at the sound of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into your gates, as [men] enter a city that is breached.

11. With the hoofs of his horses he shall trample all your streets. He shall kill your people by the sword, and the pillars of your strength shall go down to the ground.

12. And they shall plunder your riches, and make a prey of your merchandise. And they shall break down your walls and destroy your desirable houses. And they shall lay your stones and your timber and your dust in the midst of the water.

13. And I will cause the noise of your songs to cease; and the sound of your harps shall be heard no more.

14. And I will make you like a shining rock. You shall be [a place] to spread nets on; you shall be built no more; for I the LORD have spoken, says the Lord Jehovah.

15. So says the Lord Jehovah to Tyre: Shall not the coastlands shake at the sound of your fall, when the slain groan, when the slaughter is made in your midst?

16. And all the rulers of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their embroidered garments. They shall clothe themselves [with] trembling; they shall sit on the ground and tremble at [every moment, and be amazed at you.

17. And they shall take up a mourning for you, and say to you, How you who lived by the sea are destroyed, the famous city which was strong in the sea, she and her people who caused their terror [to be] on all who lived in it!

18. And the coastlands shall tremble in the day of your fall; yea, the coastlands by the sea shall be troubled at your going.

19. For so says the Lord Jehovah: When I shall make you a ruined city, like the cities that have no inhabitants; when I shall bring up the deep on you, and great waters shall cover you;

20. when I shall bring you down with those who go down into the Pit, with the people of old time, and shall set you in the low parts of the earth, in places ruined in days of old, with those who go down to the Pit, so that you have no inhabitants (but I gave glory in the land of the living)

21. I will give you terrors, and you [will] not [be]. Though you are sought, yet you shall never be found forever says the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 27

1. The Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

2. And you, son of man, take up a mourning for Tyre.

3. And say to Tyre, O you who are placed at the entrance of the sea, a merchant of the peoples for many coastlands, so says the Lord Jehovah: O Tyre, you have said, I [am] of perfect beauty.

4. Your borders [are] in the midst of the seas, your builders have perfected your beauty.

5. They have made all your [ship] boards of fir trees of Senir; they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for you.

6. They have made the oaks [of] Bashan your oars; the daughter of Assyria has made your deck of ivory from the coasts of Kittim.

7. Your sail was of fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt, an ensign for you; violet and purple from the coasts of Elishah was your covering.

8. The residents of Sidon and Arvad were your seamen. Your wise ones, O Tyre, were in you, they [were] your sailors.

9. The elders of Gebal and her wise [men] were with you, reinforcing your seams. All the ships of the sea with their seamen were with you, to exchange your merchandise.

10. Persia and Lud and Lydia were in your army, your men of war. They hung the shield and helmet in you; they set your splendor.

11. The sons of Arvad and your army [were] on your walls all around, and warriors [were] in your towers. They hung their shields on your walls all around; they have made your beauty perfect.

12. Tarshish [was] your merchant because of the multitude of [your] wealth; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they gave for your wares.

13. Javan, Tubal, and Meshech [were] your merchants. They traded the souls of men and vessels of bronze for your goods.

14. From the house of Togarmah they gave horses and war-horses and mules for your wares.

15. The sons of Dedan [were] your merchants; many coastlands [were] the traffic of your hand. They brought as your gift tusks of ivory and ebony.

16. Syria [was] your merchant because of the multitude of your works; with emeralds, purple, and embroidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and rubies they gave for your wares.

17. Judah and the land of Israel [were] your merchants with wheat [from] Minnith and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm, they gave for your goods.

18. Damascus [was] your merchant in the multitude of your works, from the multitude of all riches, in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.

19. Dan and Javan also, going about, gave for your wares; smooth iron, cassia, and cane were among your goods.

20. Dedan [was] your merchant in loose cloths for riding.

21. Arabia, and all the rulers of Kedar [were] traders of your hand, in lambs, and rams, and goats; in them [was] your trade.

22. The merchants of Sheba and Raamah [were] your merchants, with the chief of all the spices, and with every precious stone, and gold they gave for your wares.

23. Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, Chilmad [were] your merchants.

24. They [were] your merchants in perfect things, in violet cloth, and embroidered work, and in carpets of many colors, with tightly bound cords, and cedars among your merchandise.

25. The ships of Tarshish [were] the travelers of your goods. And you were filled and made very glorious in the heart of the seas.

26. Your rowers have made you come into great waters; the east wind has broken you in the heart of the seas.

27. Your riches, and your wares, your goods, your seamen, and your sailors reinforcing your seams, and the traders of your goods, and all your men of war, who [are] in you, and all your company which [is] in your midst, shall fall into the heart of the seas in the day of your ruin.

28. At the sound of the cry of your sailors the open lands will shake.

29. And all who handle the oar, the mariners, all the sailors of the sea, shall come down from their ships. They shall stand on the land,

30. and shall cause their voice to be heard against you, and shall cry bitterly, and shall throw dust on their heads. They shall wallow themselves in the ashes.

31. And they will be bald for you, and gird with sackcloth. And they shall weep for you with bitterness of soul, a bitter wailing.

32. And in their wailing they shall lift up a lamentation [and] lament over you, [saying], Who [is] like Tyre; as she who is quiet in the midst of the sea?

33. When your goods went out from the seas, you filled many people. With the plenty of your riches and your goods you enriched the kings of the earth.

34. At [this time] you are broken by the seas, in the depths of the waters, your goods and all your company in your midst have fallen.

35. All the residents of the coastlands are appalled at you, and their kings are horribly terrified; [their] faces tremble.

36. The merchants among the peoples hiss at you; you have become terrors. And you [shall] not [be] forever.

## Ezekiel 28

1. The Word of the LORD came again to me, saying,

2. Son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre. So says the Lord Jehovah: Because your heart [is] lifted up, and you have said, I [am] a god, I sit [in] the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet you [are] a man and not God, though you set your heart as the heart of gods;

3. Behold, you [are] wiser than Daniel; all secret things are not hidden from you!

4. With your wisdom and with your understanding you have made riches for yourselves, and have worked gold and silver into your treasuries.

5. By your great wisdom [and] by your trade you have multiplied your riches, and your heart is lifted up because of your riches.

6. Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have set your heart as the heart of gods,

7. behold, therefore I will bring awesome strangers [of] the nations. And they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom, and they shall defile your brightness.

8. They shall bring you down to the Pit, and you shall die the deaths of those slain in the heart of the seas.

9. Will you yet say before him who kills you, I [am of the] gods? But you [are] a man, and not God, in the hand of him who kills you.

10. You shall die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers. For I have spoken, says the Lord Jehovah.

11. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

12. Son of man, lift up a lament over the king of Tyre, and say to him, So says the Lord Jehovah: You seal the measure, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.

13. You have been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone [was] your covering, the ruby, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the turquoise, and the emerald, and gold. The workmanship of your tambourines and of your flutes was prepared in you in the day that you were created.

14. You [were] the anointed cherub that covers, and I had put you in the holy height of God [where] you were.; you have walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.

15. You [were] perfect in your ways from the day that you were created, until iniquity was found in you.

16. By the multitude of your goods they have filled your midst [with] violence, and you have sinned. So I cast you profaned from the height of God, and I destroy you, O covering cherub, from among the stones of fire.

17. Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you have spoiled your wisdom because of your brightness. I will cast you to the ground; I will put you before kings, that they may behold you.

18. By the host of your iniquities, by the iniquity of your trade, you have profaned your holy places; so I brought a fire from your midst; it shall devour you, and I will give you for ashes on the earth, before the eyes of all who see you.

19. All who know you among the peoples shall be astonished at you; you shall be terrors, and you [will] not [be] forever.

20. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

21. Son of man, set your face against Sidon, and prophesy against it.

22. And say, So says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I [am] against you, O Sidon, and I will be glorified in your midst. And they shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I have executed judgments in her and have revealed My holiness in her.

23. For I will send a plague into her, and blood into her streets. And the wounded shall fall in her midst by the sword on her on every side. And they shall know that I [am] the LORD.

24. And there will not be a pricking brier, or a painful thorn to the house of Israel any more, from all who surround them, [those] who hate them. And they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.

25. So says the Lord Jehovah: When I have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among [whom] they are scattered, and have been sanctified in them in the sight of the nations, then they shall dwell in their land that I have given to My servant Jacob.

26. And they shall dwell safely in it, and shall build houses and plant vineyards. Yea, they shall dwell safely when I have executed judgments on all those who despise them all around them; and they shall know that I [am] Jehovah their God.

## Ezekiel 29

1. In the tenth year, in the tenth [month], in the twelfth of the month, the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.

3. Speak and say, So says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I, even I, [am] against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon who lies in the midst of his rivers, who has said, My river [is] mine, and I have made it.

4. But I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will cause the fish of your rivers to stick to your scales, and I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers, and all the fish of your rivers shall stick to your scales.

5. And I will leave you [to] the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers. You shall fall on the open fields; you shall not be removed nor gathered. I have given you for food to the beasts of the field and to the birds of the heavens.

6. And all the people of Egypt shall know that I [am] the LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.

7. When they took you by your hand, you broke and tore off all their shoulder. And when they leaned on you, you shattered and made all their loins stand.

8. So the Lord Jehovah says this: Behold, I will bring a sword on you, and cut off man and beast from you.

9. And the land of Egypt shall be a desert and waste; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD, because he has said, The river [is] mine, and I have made it.

10. Behold, and therefore I [am] against you and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt a complete waste, a ruin, from Migdol [to] Syene, even to the border of Ethiopia.

11. No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, and you shall not live in it forty years.

12. And I will make the land of Egypt a ruin in the midst of the ruined lands; and her cities shall be deserted forty years among the cities [that are] laid waste. And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will scatter them through the lands.

13. Yet so says the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples where they were scattered.

14. And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return [to] the land of Pathros, into their homeland. And they shall be a low kingdom there.

15. It shall be the lowest of the kingdoms, and shall no more exalt itself above the nations. For I will make them so few, that they shall no more rule over the nations.

16. And it shall never again be the hope of the house of Israel, recalling the iniquity of their turning after them. And they shall know that I [am] the Lord Jehovah.

17. And it happened in the twenty-seventh year, in the first [month], in the first of the month, the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

18. Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre. Every head [was] made bald, and every shoulder was peeled. Yet neither he nor his army had any pay for Tyre, for the service that he had served against it.

19. So the Lord Jehovah says this: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. And he shall take her host, and take her spoil, and seize her plunder. And it shall be the wages for his army.

20. I have given him the land of Egypt [for] his labor with which he served against it, because they worked for Me, says the Lord Jehovah.

21. In that day I will make a horn spring up to the house of Israel, and I will give you the opening of the mouth in their midst. And they shall know that I [am] the LORD.

## Ezekiel 30

1. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, prophesy and say, So says the Lord Jehovah: Howl, Woe is the day!

3. For the day [is] near, even the day of the LORD [is] near, a cloudy day. It shall be the time of the nations.

4. And the sword shall come on Egypt, and great pain shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.

5. Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mixed people; and Chub, and the men of the land [who are in] covenant with them shall fall by the sword.

6. So says the LORD: Those who uphold Egypt shall also fall, and the pride of her power shall come down. From Migdol to Syene they shall fall in it by the sword, says the Lord Jehovah.

7. And they shall be ruined in the midst of the wasted lands, and her cities shall be in the midst of the wasted cities.

8. And they shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I have set a fire in Egypt and all her helpers shall be destroyed.

9. In that day messengers shall go out from Me in ships to terrify the confident Ethiopians, and anguish shall be on them, as in the day of Egypt; for lo, it is coming.

10. So says the Lord Jehovah: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.

11. He and his people with them, the fearful of the nations, shall be brought to destroy the land. And they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land [with] the slain.

12. And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked. And I will waste the land, and her fullness, by the hand of strangers. I the LORD have spoken.

13. So says the Lord Jehovah: I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause their images to cease out of Noph. And there shall no more be a ruler of the land in Egypt; and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.

14. And I will make Pathros a ruin, and will set fire in Zoan, and will do judgments in No.

15. And I will pour My fury on Sin, the strength of Egypt. And I will cut off the multitude of No.

16. And I will set fire in Egypt; Sin shall greatly anguish, and No shall be torn in pieces, and Noph [shall have] daily woes.

17. The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword; and these [cities] shall go into exile.

18. And at Tahpanhes also the day shall be held back, when I shatter the yokes of Egypt there. And the pride of her strength shall cease in her; as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into exile.

19. So I will do judgments in Egypt; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.

20. And it happened in the eleventh year, in the first [month], in the seventh of the month, the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

21. Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And lo, it shall not lie bound up to give healing, to put a bandage to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword.

22. So the Lord Jehovah says this: Behold, I [am] against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong one and the broken one. And I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.

23. And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will scatter them through the lands.

24. And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put My sword in his hand. But I will break Pharaoh's arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of one who is stabbed.

25. But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall. And they shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I shall put My sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it on the land of Egypt.

26. And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and scatter them among the lands. And they shall know that I [am] the LORD.

## Ezekiel 31

1. And it happened in the eleventh year, in the third [month], in the first of the month, the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude: To whom are you like in your greatness?

3. Behold, Assyria [was like] a cedar in Lebanon, [with] fair branches and forest shade, and of great height. And his top was among the thick boughs.

4. The waters made him great; the deep set him up on high with her rivers running all around his plants, and sent out her little channels to all the trees of the field.

5. So his height was lifted up above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the many waters, when he sent out.

6. All the birds of the heavens nested in his boughs, and under his branches all the beasts of the field bore their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.

7. So he was beautiful in his greatness, in the length of his branches. For his root was by great waters.

8. The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him; the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches. Nor was any tree in the garden of God like him in his beauty.

9. I have made him beautiful by his many branches, so that all the trees of Eden in the garden of God envied him.

10. So the Lord Jehovah says this: Because you have lifted yourself up in height, and he set his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;

11. so I have given him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations. He shall surely deal with him; I have expelled him for his evil.

12. And strangers have cut him off, the fearful of the nations, and have left him. On the mountains and in all the valleys his branches have fallen, and his boughs have been broken by all the rivers of the land. And all the people of the earth have gone from his shadow, and have left him.

13. On his ruin shall all the birds of the heavens remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be on his branches,

14. to the end that none of all the trees [by] the waters shall be exalted in their height, nor give their top among the thick boughs, nor should their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water. For all of them are given to death, to the lower parts of the earth, in the midst of the sons of men, with those who go down into the Pit.

15. So says the Lord Jehovah: In the day when he went down to the grave, I caused a mourning. I covered the deep for him, and I held back its floods, and the great waters were held back. And I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted because of him.

16. I made the nations shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with those who go down in the Pit. And all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the lower parts of the earth.

17. They also went down into hell with him to [those who are] slain with the sword, even his arm, who lived under his shadow in the midst of the nations.

18. To whom are you like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? Yet you shall be brought down with the trees of Eden to the lower parts of the earth. You shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with [those] slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all [his] multitude, says the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 32

1. And it happened in the twelfth year, in the twelfth [month], on the first of the month, the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, take up a lament for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him, You were like a young lion of the nations, but you [were] like a sea-monster. And you came out with your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet, and fouled their rivers.

3. So says the Lord Jehovah: I will therefore spread out My net over you with an assembly of many peoples; and they shall lift you up in My net.

4. And I will leave you on the land; I will cast you on the face of the field, and cause all the birds of the heavens to remain on you, and I will fill the beasts of all the earth with you.

5. And I will put your flesh on the mountains, and fill the valleys with your height.

6. I will also water with your blood the land in which you swim, even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of you.

7. And when I put you out, I will cover the heaven and make its stars dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.

8. I will make all the bright lights of the heavens dark over you, and will set darkness on your land, says the Lord Jehovah.

9. I will also vex the hearts of many peoples, when I bring your breaking among the nations, into the lands which you have not known.

10. Yea, I will make many people amazed at you, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for you, when I shall brandish My sword before them; and they shall tremble at [every] moment, [each] man for his own life, in the day of your fall.

11. For so says the Lord Jehovah: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come on you.

12. By the swords of the mighty, I will cause your host to fall, the fearful of the nations, all of them. And they shall spoil the pride of Egypt, and all its host shall be destroyed.

13. I will also destroy all its beasts from beside the great waters. Nor shall the foot of man stir them any more, nor shall the hoofs of beasts stir them.

14. And I will make their waters sink, and cause their rivers to run like oil, says the Lord Jehovah.

15. When I shall make the land of Egypt a ruin, and the land shall be stripped of its fullness; when I shall strike all those who dwell in it; then they shall know that I [am] the LORD.

16. This [is] the mourning with which they shall mourn her. The daughters of the nations shall mourn her; they shall mourn for her, for Egypt and for all her multitude, says the Lord Jehovah.

17. It was also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth of the month, [that] the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

18. Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and bring it down, her and the daughters of the majestic nations, to the lower parts of the earth, with those who go down [into] the Pit.

19. Than whom are you more lovely? Go down and be laid with the uncircumcised.

20. They shall fall in the midst of [those] slain by the sword; she is delivered to the sword; they draw her and all her multitudes.

21. The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with those who help him. They have gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.

22. Assyria [is] there and all her company. His graves [are] around him; all of them are slain, fallen by the sword;

23. their graves are set in the sides of the Pit, and her company is all around her grave. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword, those who caused terror in the land of the living.

24. There [is] Elam and her multitude all around her grave. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword, who have gone down uncircumcised into the lower parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living. Yet they have borne their shame with those who go down to the Pit.

25. They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude. Her graves [are] all around him; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; though their terror was given in the land of the living, yet they have borne their shame with those who go down to the Pit. He is put among the slain.

26. There [is] Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude. Her graves [are] all around him. All of them are uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they gave their terror in the land of the living.

27. And they shall not lie with the mighty [that are] fallen of the uncircumcised, who have gone down to hell with their weapons of war. And they have put their swords under their heads, but their sins shall be on their bones, though they [were] the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.

28. Yea, you shall be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shall lie with [those] slain with the sword.

29. There [is] Edom, her kings, and all her rulers, who with their might are laid by [those] slain by the sword. They shall be with the uncircumcised and with those who go down to the Pit.

30. There [are] the rulers of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down with the slain in their terror. They are ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with those who are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit.

31. Pharaoh shall see them and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army killed by the sword, says the Lord Jehovah.

32. For I had put his terror in the land of the living. And he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with [those] slain with the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 33

1. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, speak to the sons of your people, and say to them: When I bring the sword on it, on a land, and take one man from the people of the land, of their borders, and set him for their watchman;

3. if, when he sees the sword come on the land, he blows the trumpet and warns the people,

4. then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet and does not take warning, if the sword does come and take him away, his blood shall be on his own head.

5. He heard the sound of the trumpet and did not take warning. His blood shall be on himself. But he who takes warning shall deliver his soul.

6. But if the watchman sees the sword coming, and does not blow the trumpet and the people are not warned; if the sword comes and takes [any] person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity. But I will require his blood at the watchman's hand.

7. And you, son of man, I have set you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore you shall hear the Word from My mouth, and warn them from Me.

8. When I say to the wicked, O wicked one, you shall surely die; if you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked one shall die in his iniquity; but I will require his blood at your hand.

9. But, if you warn the wicked of his way, to turn from it; if he does not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your soul.

10. And you, son of man, speak to the house of Israel. So you have spoken, saying, When our transgressions and our sins [are] on us, and we are wasting away in them, How then shall we live?

11. Say to them: [As] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, I have no delight in the death of the wicked, except in the turning of the wicked from his way, and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways; for why will you die, O house of Israel?

12. Therefore, son of man, say to the sons of your people: The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression. As for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall by it in the day he turns from his wickedness. Nor shall the righteous be able to live for his [righteousness] in the day that he sins.

13. When I shall say to the righteous [that] he shall surely live; if he trusts in his own righteousness and commits iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he has committed, he shall die for it.

14. Again, when I say to the wicked, You shall surely die; if he turns from his sin and does justice and right;

15. [if] the wicked gives back the pledge, gives again what he had robbed, walks in the statutes of life without committing iniquity, then he shall surely live; he shall not die.

16. None of his sins that he has committed shall be called to his memory. He has done justice and right; he shall surely live.

17. Yet the sons of your people say, The way of the Lord is not fair. But as for them, their way is not fair.

18. When the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he shall even die by them.

19. But if the wicked turns from his wickedness and does justice and right, he shall live by them.

20. Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not fair. O house of Israel, I will judge you, each one according to his ways.

21. And it was in the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth [month], on the fifth of the month, one who escaped out of Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city is stricken.

22. And the LORD's hand was on me in the evening, before he who had escaped came. And He had opened my mouth until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was dumb no more.

23. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

24. Son of man, those who live in those wastes of the land of Israel are speaking, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land. But we [are] many; the land is given to us for inheritance.

25. So say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: You eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood; and shall you possess the land?

26. You stand on your sword, you work abomination, each defiling his neighbor's wife. And shall you possess the land?

27. Speak to them in this way, So says the Lord Jehovah: [As] I live, surely those who [are] in the ruins shall fall by the sword, and I will give him who [is] in the open field to the beasts to be eaten up, and those in the forts and in the caves shall die of the plague.

28. For I have made the land a ruin, and the pride of her strength has ceased. And the mountains of Israel shall be a waste, so that none shall pass through.

29. And they shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I have made the land a ruin because of all their abominations which they have committed.

30. And you, son of man, the sons of your people are still talking about you by the walls, and in the doors of the houses, and speaking to one another, each man to his brother, saying, I pray you, come and hear what is the word which comes from the LORD.

31. And they come to you as the people come, and they sit before you [as] My people, and they hear your words. But they will not do them. For with their mouth they show much love, [but] their heart goes after their unjust gain.

32. And lo, you [are] to them as a singer of love songs [with] a beautiful voice, and able to play well on an instrument; for they hear your words, but they do not do them.

33. And when this happens; lo, it will come; then they shall know that a prophet has been among them.

## Ezekiel 34

1. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy and say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah to the shepherds: Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flocks?

3. You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool; you kill the fat ones, [but] you do not feed the flock.

4. You have not made the weak strong, nor have you healed the sick, nor have you bound up the broken. You have not brought again those driven away, nor have you sought that which was lost; but you have ruled them with force and with cruelty.

5. And they were scattered for lack of a shepherd. And they became food to all the beasts of the field when they were scattered.

6. My sheep wandered through all the mountains and on every high hill. Yea, My flock was scattered on all the face of the earth, and none searched nor sought for them.

7. Therefore, shepherds, hear the Word of the LORD:

8. [As] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, surely because My flock became a prey, and My flock became food to every beast of the field, because [there was] no shepherd, nor did My shepherds search [for] My flock, but the shepherds fed themselves and did not feed My flock,

9. therefore, O shepherds, hear the Word of the LORD.

10. So says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I [am] against the shepherds, and I will require My flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock. Nor shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver My flock from their mouth, and they will not be food to devour.

11. For so says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I Myself will search for My sheep and seek them out.

12. As a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among his scattered sheep, so I will seek out My sheep and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.

13. And I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the lands, and will bring them to their own land and feed them on the mountain of Israel by the rivers, and in all the places of the land where people live.

14. I will feed them in a good pasture, and their fold shall be on the high mountains of Israel. There they shall lie in a good fold, and [in] a fat pasture they shall feed on the mountains of Israel.

15. I will feed My flock, and I will cause them to lie down, says the Lord Jehovah.

16. I will seek the lost, and bring again those driven away, and will bind up the broken, and will strengthen the sick. But I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.

17. And you, My flock, says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I judge between lamb and lamb, [between] rams and he-goats.

18. Is it a small thing to you to have eaten up the good pasture, but you must trample the rest of your pastures with your feet? And to have drunk of the clear waters, but you must foul the rest with your feet?

19. And My flock, they eat [what] your feet have trampled, and they drink [what] your feet have fouled.

20. So the Lord Jehovah says this to them: Behold I Myself will even judge between the fat lamb and the lean lamb.

21. Because you have thrust with side and with shoulder, and have pushed all the weak with your horns until you have scattered them to the outside,

22. therefore I will save My flock, and they shall no more be a prey. And I will judge between lamb and lamb.

23. And I will set up one Shepherd over them, and He shall feed them, My servant David. He shall feed them, and He shall be their Shepherd.

24. And I the LORD will be their God, and My servant David a ruler among them. I the LORD have spoken.

25. And I will make a covenant of peace with them, and will send the evil beasts out of the land. And they shall dwell safely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods.

26. And I will make them, and the places around My hill, a blessing; and I will bring down the shower in its season. There shall be showers of blessing.

27. And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase. And they shall be safe in their land, and they shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and have delivered them out of the hands of those who enslaved them.

28. And no more shall they be a prey to the nations, nor shall the beast of the land eat them. But they shall dwell safely, and none shall terrify [them].

29. And I will raise up for them a [noted] planting place, and they shall never again [be of] those gathered by famine in the land, nor shall they bear the shame of the nations any more.

30. And they shall know that I, Jehovah their God, [am] with them, and they, the house of Israel, [are] My people, says the Lord Jehovah.

31. And you My sheep, the sheep of My pasture, [are] men, and I [am] your God, says the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 35

1. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir and prophesy against it.

3. And say to it, So says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, O Mount Seir, I [am] against you, and I will stretch out My hand against you, and I will make you a ruin and a waste.

4. I will raze your cities, and you shall be ruined, and you shall know that I [am] the LORD.

5. Because you have had a never-ending hatred, and have shed [the blood of] the sons of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time [that] iniquity [had] an end,

6. therefore, [as] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, I will yield you up to blood, and blood shall pursue you. Since you have not hated blood, even blood shall pursue you.

7. So I will make Mount Seir a ruin, and cut off from it the one passing through, and the one returning.

8. And I will fill his mountains [with] his dead. [In] your hills, and your valleys, and all your rivers, those slain with the sword shall fall in them.

9. I will make you ruins forever, and your cities shall not be inhabited. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD.

10. Because you have said, These two nations and these two lands shall be mine, and we shall possess it; yet the LORD was there;

11. therefore, [as] I live, says the Lord Jehovah, I will act by your anger and by your envy which you have shown out of your hatred against them. And I will make Myself known among them when I have judged you.

12. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD. I have heard all your blasphemies which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, Desolation! They are given to us for food.

13. So with your mouth you have boasted against Me, and have multiplied your words against Me. I have heard [them].

14. So says the Lord Jehovah: When the whole earth rejoices, I will make you a ruin.

15. As you rejoiced at the inheritance of the house of Israel because of desolation, so I will do to you. You shall be a desolation, O Mount Seir and all Idumea, even all of it. And they shall know that I [am] the LORD.

## Ezekiel 36

1. Also, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, Mountains of Israel, hear the Word of the LORD.

2. So says the Lord Jehovah: Because the enemy has said against you, Aha! Even the old high places have become a possession to us.

3. Therefore prophesy and say, So says the Lord Jehovah: Because of the wasting and crushing of you from all around, that you might be a possession to the rest of the nations, and you were lifted up on the tip of the tongue, and the talking of the people;

4. so, mountains of Israel, hear the Word of the Lord Jehovah. So says the Lord Jehovah to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the deserted wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and a mockery to the rest of the nations all around.

5. So the Lord Jehovah says this: Surely in the fire of My jealousy I have spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Idumea, who have given My land to themselves for a possession with all joy of heart, with scorning of soul, to make it open land for a prey.

6. So prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and to the hills, to the rivers and to the valleys, So says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I have spoken in My jealousy and in My fury, because you have borne the shame of the nations.

7. Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: I have lifted up My hand; surely the nations around you shall bear their shame.

8. But you, O mountains of Israel, you shall put out your branches and yield your fruit to My people Israel; for they have drawn near to come.

9. For, behold, I [am] for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown.

10. And I will multiply men on you, all the house of Israel, all of it. And the cities shall have people, and the wastes shall be built.

11. And I will multiply men and beast on you, and they shall increase and be fruitful. And I will make you dwell as before, and I will do better [to you] than at your beginnings. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD.

12. Yea, I will cause men to walk on you, even My people Israel. And they shall possess you, and you shall be their inheritance, and not any more will increase their bereavement.

13. So says the Lord Jehovah: Because they say to you, You [are] a devourer of men, and you have bereaved your nations;

14. so you shall devour men no more, nor shall you bereave your nations any more, says the Lord Jehovah.

15. Nor will I allow you to hear the shame of the nations any more, nor shall you bear the shame of the peoples any more, nor shall you cause your nations to fall any more, says the Lord Jehovah.

16. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying.

17. Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings, even as the defilement of woman's impurity, their way was before Me.

18. So I poured My fury on them, because of the blood that they had shed on the land, and for their idols [by which] they defiled it.

19. And I scattered them among the nations, and they were scattered through the lands. I judged them according to their way and according to their doings.

20. And when they entered the nations where they went, they even profaned My holy name by saying to them, These [are] the people of the Jehovah, and they are gone out of His land.

21. But I had pity for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations where they went.

22. Therefore say to the house of Israel, So says the Lord Jehovah: I do not do [this] for your sake, O house of Israel, but for My holy name's sake, which you have profaned among the nations where you went.

23. And I will sanctify My great name, which was profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst. And the nations shall know that I [am] the LORD, says the Lord Jehovah, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.

24. For I will take you from among the nations and gather you out of all lands, and will gather you into your own land.

25. And I will sprinkle clean waters on you, and you shall be clean. I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from your idols.

26. And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. And I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.

27. And I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you shall keep My judgments and do [them].

28. And you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers. And you shall be My people, and I will be your God.

29. I will also save you from all your defilements, and I will call for the grain, and will increase it, and will lay no famine on you.

30. And I will multiply the fruits of the tree and the increase of the field, so that you shall never again receive the curse of famine among the nations.

31. And you shall remember your own evil ways, and your doings that [were] not good, and shall despise yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.

32. I do not do [this] for your sake, says the Lord Jehovah, be it known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.

33. So says the Lord Jehovah: In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will also cause [you] to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be built.

34. And the waste land shall be tilled, instead of being a ruin before all passing by.

35. And they shall say, This land that was wasted has become like the garden of Eden. And the wasted, deserted and ruined cities now [are] fortified and inhabited.

36. And the nations that are left all around you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined [places and] plant that which was wasted. I the LORD have spoken it, and I will do it.

37. So says the Lord Jehovah: yet this, I will be sought by the house of Israel to act for them. I will increase them with men like a flock.

38. As a holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men. And they shall know that I [am] the LORD.

## Ezekiel 37

1. The hand of the LORD was on me, and brought me by the Spirit of the LORD, and made me rest in the midst of a valley, and it [was] full of bones.

2. And He made me pass among them all around. And behold, very many [were] on the face of the valley. And lo, [they were] very dry.

3. And he said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord Jehovah, You know.

4. Again He said to me, Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the Word of the LORD.

5. So says the Lord Jehovah to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live.

6. And I will lay sinews on you, and will bring up flesh on you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD.

7. So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a noise. And behold, a shaking! And the bones came near, a bone to its bone.

8. And I watched. And behold! The sinews and the flesh came up on them, and the skin covered them above. But [there was] no breath in them.

9. And He said to me, Prophesy to the Spirit, prophesy, son of man, and say to the Spirit, So says the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O Spirit, and breathe on these dead ones so that they may live.

10. So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the Spirit came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army.

11. And He said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, Our bones [are] dried and our hope is lost; we are cut off by ourselves.

12. Therefore prophesy and say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, O My people, I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves, and will bring you into the land of Israel.

13. And you shall know that I [am] the LORD when I have opened your graves, O My people, and have brought you up out of your graves.

14. And I shall put My Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. And you shall know that I the LORD have spoken and have done it, says the LORD.

15. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

16. And you, son of man, take a stick and write on it, For Judah and for his companions, the sons of Israel. And take another stick and write on it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and all the house of Israel, his companions.

17. And join them to one another into one stick. And they shall become one in your hand.

18. And when the sons of your people shall speak to you, saying, Will you not declare to us what these [mean] to you?

19. Say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which [is] in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel, his companions, and I will put them with him, with the stick of Judah, and will make them one stick, and they shall be one in My hand.

20. And the sticks [on] which you write shall be in your hand before their eyes.

21. And say to them, So says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the sons of Israel from among the nations where they have gone, and will gather them on every side, and will bring them into their own land.

22. And I will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel, and one King shall be king to them all. And they shall not still be two nations, nor shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.

23. Nor shall they be defiled with their idols, even with their filthy idols, nor with all of their transgressions. But I will save them out of all their dwelling places, in them where they sinned, and will cleanse them. And they shall be to Me for a people, and I will be to them for God.

24. And David My servant [shall be] King over them. And there shall be one Shepherd to all of them. And they shall walk in My judgments, and obey My laws, and do them.

25. And they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob My servant, the land in which your fathers have lived. And they shall dwell in it, even they and their sons, and the sons of their sons for ever. And My servant David [shall be their ruler forever.

26. And I will cut a covenant of peace with them. It shall be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will place them, and multiply them, and will set My sanctuary in their midst forever.

27. And My tabernacle shall be with them. Yea, I will be their God, and they shall be My people.

28. And the nations shall know that I the LORD sanctify Israel, when My sanctuary shall be in their midst forever.

## Ezekiel 38

1. And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,

2. Son of man, set your face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief ruler of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him.

3. And say, So says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I [am] against you, O Gog, the chief ruler of Rosh, Meshech and Tubal.

4. And I will turn you back, and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you out, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed most perfectly, a great assembly [with] buckler and shield, all of them swordsmen;

5. Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them, all of them [with] shield and helmet;

6. Gomer and all his bands; the house of Togarmah [from] the recesses of the north, and all his bands; [and] many peoples with you.

7. Be prepared; yea, prepare for yourself, you and all your assembly that are assembled to you, and be a guard to them.

8. After many days you will be visited. In the latter years you shall come into the land turned back from the sword, gathered out of many peoples, on the mountains of Israel, which have always been waste. (But he has been brought out of the peoples, and they shall dwell securely, all of them.)

9. And you shall go up, coming like a storm. You shall be like a cloud to cover the land, you and all your bands, and many peoples with you.

10. So says the Lord Jehovah: And it shall be in that day that things shall come into your heart, and you shall devise an evil plan.

11. And you shall say, I will go up to the land of open spaces. I will go [to] those at ease, who dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and there are no bars nor gates to them,

12. in order to take a spoil, and to steal a prize; to turn your hand on the inhabited waste places, and on the people gathered out of the nations, who have gotten cattle and goods, who dwell in the midst of the land.

13. Sheba and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all their young lions, shall say to you, Have you come to take a spoil? Have you gathered your company to steal a prize, to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?

14. So, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog, So says the Lord Jehovah: In that day when My people of Israel dwells securely, shall you not know [it] ?

15. And you shall come from your place out of the recesses of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great company and a mighty army.

16. And you shall come up on My people Israel like a cloud, to cover the land. It shall be in the last days, and I will bring you against My land, so that the nations may know Me when I shall be sanctified in you, O Gog, before their eyes.

17. So says the Lord Jehovah: [Are] you he of whom I have spoken in former days, by the hand of My servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days [and] years that I would bring you against them?

18. And it shall be on that day, when Gog comes against the land of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah, My fury shall come up in My face.

19. For in My jealousy [and] in the fire of My wrath I have spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great quaking in the land of Israel,

20. so that the fish of the sea, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep on the earth, and all the men on the face of the earth, shall quake at My presence. And the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.

21. And I will call for a sword against him on all My mountains, says the Lord Jehovah. [Each] man's sword shall be against his brother.

22. And I will judge him with a plague and with blood. And I will rain on him, and on his bands, and on the many peoples with him, an overflowing shower, and great hailstones, fire and brimstone.

23. So I will magnify Myself and sanctify Myself. And I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.

## Ezekiel 39

1. Therefore, son of man, prophesy against Gog and say, So says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I [am] against you, O Gog, the chief ruler of Rosh, Meshech and Tubal.

2. And I will turn you back, and lead you on. And I will bring you up from the recesses of the north, and I will bring you on the mountains of Israel.

3. And I will strike your bow out of your left hand, and will cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand.

4. You shall fall on the mountains of Israel, you and all your bands, and the people with you. I will give you for food to the birds of prey of every kind, and [to] the beasts of the field.

5. You shall fall on the face of the field, for I have spoken, says the Lord Jehovah.

6. And I will send a fire on Magog, and on the secure inhabitants of the coasts. And they shall know that I [am] the LORD.

7. And I will make My holy name known in the midst of My people Israel. And I will not [let them] profane My holy name any more. And the nations shall know that I [am] the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.

8. Behold, it is coming, and it will be done, says the Lord Jehovah. This [is] the day of which I have spoken.

9. And the inhabitants of the cities of Israel shall go out and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the javelins, and the spears. And they shall burn them with fire seven years,

10. so that they shall take no wood out of the field, nor cut down [any] out of the forests for they shall burn the weapons for fire. And they shall plunder those who plundered them, and rob those who robbed them, says the Lord Jehovah.

11. And it will be in that day I will give to Gog a place there, a grave in Israel, the valley of those who pass by, east of the sea. And it shall stop the [noses] of those who pass by. And there they shall bury Gog and all his multitude. And [they] shall call [it], The Valley of the Multitude of Gog.

12. And the house of Israel shall bury them, to cleanse the land, seven months.

13. And all the people of the land shall bury. And it shall be a name to them, the day when I am glorified, says the Lord Jehovah.

14. And men shall separate those who continually pass through the land, burying those who passed through, who remain on the face of the earth, to cleanse it. At the end of seven months they shall search.

15. And [as] they pass, those who pass through the land, and [any] man sees a bone, then he shall build a post beside it, until the buriers have buried it in The Valley of the Multitude of Gog.

16. And also the name of the city [is] The Multitude. And they shall cleanse the land.

17. And you, son of man, So says the Lord Jehovah. Speak to the bird of every wing, and to every beast of the field: Gather yourselves and come; gather yourselves from all around to My sacrifice that I sacrifice for you, a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, so that you may eat flesh and drink blood.

18. You shall eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the rulers of the earth, of rams, lambs, goats, [and] bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan.

19. And you shall eat fat until you are full, and drink blood until you are drunk, of My sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.

20. And you shall be filled at My table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, all the men of war, says the Lord Jehovah.

21. And I will set My glory among the nations, and all the nations shall see My judgments which I have done, and My hand that I have laid on them.

22. So the house of Israel shall know that I [am] Jehovah their God from that day and forward.

23. And the nations shall know that the house of Israel was exiled for their iniquity. Because they sinned against Me, therefore I hid My face from them and gave them into the hand of their enemies. So they all fell by the sword.

24. According to their uncleanness and according to their sins I have done to them, and have hidden My face from them.

25. Therefore so says the Lord Jehovah: And I will return the captivity of Jacob, and will have mercy on the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for My holy name;

26. [after] they have borne their shame and all their sins by which they have sinned against Me, when they dwell securely in their land and no one terrifies;

27. when I have brought them again from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;

28. then they shall know that I [am] the LORD their God who exiled them among the nations. But I have gathered them to their own land, and have not left any of them there.

29. Nor will I hide My face from them any more, for I have poured out My Spirit on the house of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 40

1. In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was stricken, in the same day the hand of the LORD was on me, and brought me there.

2. In the visions of God He brought me into the land of Israel, and made me rest on a very high mountain. And it went up, as the structure of the city on the south.

3. And He brought me there, and behold, a man whose appearance [was] like the look of bronze, and a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed. And he stood in the gate.

4. And the man said to me, Son of man, behold with your eyes and hear with your ears, and set your heart on all that I shall show you. For you are brought here so that I might show them to you. Declare all that you see to the house of Israel.

5. And behold, a wall on the outside of the house all around, and in the man's hand [was] a measuring reed, six cubits [long], with a cubit and a span. And he measured the building's breadth, one reed; and the height, one reed.

6. And he came to the gate which faced eastward, and went up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate, one reed wide, even the one threshold, one reed wide.

7. And a room [was] one reed long and one reed wide. And between the rooms [were] five cubits. And the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate from the house, one reed.

8. He also measured the porch of the gate inside, one reed.

9. And he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its pillars, two cubits; also the porch of the gate from the house.

10. And the gate rooms eastward [were] three from here, and three from there; one measure to the three of them; and one measure [was] to the pillars from here and from there.

11. And he measured the breadth of the gate-opening, ten cubits. The length of the gate [was] thirteen cubits.

12. And the border in front of the rooms [was] one cubit from here, and the space [was] one cubit from there. And the room [was] six cubits from here and six cubits from there.

13. And he measured the gate of the room from the roof to roof, twenty-five cubits wide, door to door.

14. He also made the pillars, sixty cubits, even to the court-pillar, [from] the gate all around.

15. And on the face of the entrance gate to the face of the porch of the inner gate [was] fifty cubits;

16. and latticed windows [were] to the rooms and to their pillars inside the gate all around. And so for the porches; and windows [were] all around inside; and to each pillar [were] palm trees.

17. And he brought me into the outer court, and lo, chambers, and a pavement made for the court all around. Thirty rooms [were] on the pavement.

18. And the pavement by the side of the gates to equal the length of the gates [was] the lower pavement.

19. And he measured the breadth from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner court on the outside, a hundred cubits eastward and northward.

20. And the gate which faces the way of the north of the outer court, he measured its length and its breadth.

21. And its rooms [were] three from here and three from there. And its pillars and its porches were according to the first measure. Its length [was] fifty cubits, and its breadth, twenty-five cubits.

22. And their windows, and their porches, and their palm trees, [were] according to the measure of the gate facing the east. And they went up to it by seven steps; and its porches [were] before them.

23. And the gate of the inner court [was] across from the gate toward the north and toward the east. And he measured from gate to gate, a hundred cubits.

24. And he led me southward, and behold a gate southward. And he measured its pillars and its porches according to these measures.

25. And [there were] windows in it and in its porches all around, like those windows. The length [was] fifty cubits, and the breadth, twenty-five cubits.

26. And seven steps [were] going up to it, and its porches [were] before them. And [it had] palm trees, one from here and another from there, on its pillars.

27. And [there was] a gate in the inner court southward. And he measured from gate to gate southward, a hundred cubits.

28. And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate. And he measured the south gate according to these measures,

29. and its rooms and its pillars and its porches according to these measures. And [there were] windows in it and in its porches all around. It [was] fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.

30. And the porches all around [were] twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide.

31. And its porches [were] toward the outer court; and palm trees on its pillars. And its stairway [had] eight steps.

32. And he brought me into the inner court eastward. And he measured the gate according to these measures.

33. And its rooms, and its pillars, and its porches, [were] measured according to these measures. And there [were] windows in it and in its porches all around. It [was] fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.

34. And its porches [were] toward the outer court. And palm trees [were] on its pillars, from here, and from there. And its stairway [had] eight steps.

35. And he brought me to the north gate, and measured [it] according to these measures;

36. its rooms, its pillars, and its porches, and its windows all around. The length [was] fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.

37. And its pillars [were] toward the outer court. And palm trees [were] on its pillars, from here and from there. And its stairway [had] eight steps.

38. And the chamber and its door [was] by the pillars of the gates; they washed the burnt offering there.

39. And in the porch of the gate [were] two tables from here and two tables from there, for the slaughtering of the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering.

40. And to the side outside, as one goes up to the door of the gate northward [were] two tables; and on the other side at the porch of the gate, two tables.

41. Four tables [were] from here, and four tables [were] from there, by the side of the gate: eight tables; they slaughter on them.

42. And the four tables for burnt offering [were] of cut stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high. They also rested on them the instruments with which they slaughtered the burnt offering and the sacrifice.

43. And the double hooks of one span [were] fastened in the house all around, and on the tables the flesh of the offering.

44. And from the outside to the inner court [were] the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which [was] at the side of the north gate. And their face [was] southward: one at the side of the east gate looked the way of the north.

45. And he said to me, This chamber facing southward [is] for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.

46. And the chamber facing northward [is] for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar. They are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, who come near the LORD to minister to Him.

47. And he measured the court, a square, a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide; and the altar [was] before the house.

48. And he brought me to the porch of the house and measured [each] pillar of the porch, five cubits from here and five cubits from there. And the gate [was] three cubits wide from here and three cubits from there.

49. The porch [was] twenty cubits long, and eleven cubits wide. And [he brought me] by the steps by which they went up to it. And columns [were] by the pillars, one from here and another from there.

## Ezekiel 41

1. And he brought me to the temple and measured the pillars, six cubits wide from here and six cubits wide from there, which [was] the breadth of the tabernacle.

2. And the breadth of the door [was] ten cubits; and the sides of the door, five cubits from here, and five cubits from there. And he measured its length, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.

3. And he went inside and measured the pillar of the door, two cubits; and the door [was] six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.

4. And he measured its length, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple. And he said to me, This [is] the Holy of Holies.

5. And he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the width of each side room [was] four cubits, all around the house on [every] side.

6. And the side chambers [were] a side chamber over a side chamber, three stories, and thirty times. And [they] entered the wall of the house for the side chambers all around, that they might be fastened, for they [were] not fastened to the wall of the house.

7. And there [was] a widening, and a winding upwards [and] upwards to the side chambers. For the winding around of the house went upward [and] upward, all around the house. On account of this the width of the house went upward, and so from the lowest it went up to the highest by the middle [story].

8. I also saw the height of the house all around. The foundations of the side rooms [were] a full reed, six large cubits by joining.

9. The width of the wall, which [was] for the side chamber to the outside, [was] five cubits, and what [was] left between the side chambers that [were] of the house.

10. And between the chambers [was] the width of twenty cubits, circling the house all around.

11. And the door of the side chamber [was] toward the open space, one door northward and one door southward. And the width of the place of the open space [was] five cubits all around.

12. And the building that [was] before the separate place at the end of the way of the west [was] seventy cubits wide. And the wall of the building [was] five cubits wide all around, and its length, ninety cubits.

13. And he measured the house, a hundred cubits long. And the separate place, and the building, and its wall, [were] a hundred cubits long.

14. And the width of the front of the house and of the separate place eastward [was] a hundred cubits.

15. And he measured the length of the building to the front of the separate place which [was] behind it; and its gallery from here and from there, a hundred cubits, with the inner temple and the porches of the court,

16. the thresholds, and the latticed narrow windows, and the galleries all around, their three stories across from the threshold, with wood panelings all around, and [from] the ground up to the windows; and the windows [were] covered;

17. to that above the door, even to the inner house, and outside, and by all the wall around inside and outside, by measure.

18. And it [was] made with cherubs and palm trees, and a palm tree [was] between cherub and cherub. And each cherub had two faces,

19. the face of a man [was] toward the palm tree from here, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree from there. It [was] made through all the house all around.

20. From the ground to above the door [were] cherubs and palm trees made, and [on] the wall of the temple.

21. The temple doorposts [were] squared, and the face of the sanctuary. The looks of the one was like the looks of the other.

22. The altar of wood [was] three cubits high, and its length two cubits. And its corners, and its length, and its walls, [were] of wood. And he said to me, This is the table that is before the LORD.

23. And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.

24. And two doors [leaves] [were] to [each] of the doors, two turning doors, two for the one door, and two for the other door.

25. And on them, on the temple doors, [were] made cherubs and palm trees like those made on the walls, and thick wood on the face of the porch outside.

26. And latticed windows, and palm trees, [were] from here and from there, on the sides of the porch, and on the side chambers of the house, and wooden [canopies].

## Ezekiel 42

1. And he brought me out into the outer court, the way northward. And he brought me into the chamber that [was] across from the separate place and which [was] in front of the building to the north.

2. Before the length of a hundred cubits [was] the north door, and the width [was] fifty cubits.

3. Across from the twenty cubits which [were] for the inner court, and across from the pavement which [was] for the outer court, gallery [was] on gallery in three stories.

4. And before the chambers [was] a walk of ten cubits width inward, a way of one cubit. And their doors [were] northward.

5. And the upper chambers [were] shorter; for the galleries used up more space than the lower and middle ones in the building.

6. For they [were] in three [stories], but there [were] no columns to them like the columns of the courts. So [the third] story was made narrower than the lower and the middle stories from the ground.

7. And the wall that [was] outside near the chambers, toward the outer court on the front of the chambers, its length [was] fifty cubits.

8. For the length of the chambers that [were] in the outer court [was] fifty cubits. And lo, in front of the temple [was] a hundred cubits.

9. And under these chambers [was] the entrance on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court,

10. in the width of the wall of the court eastward, to the front of the separate area, and to the front of the building [were] chambers.

11. And the way in front of them looked like the chambers which [were] northward, as their length, so their width. And all their exits [were] as their patterns, and as their doors.

12. And as the doors of the chambers that [were] southward [was] a door in the head of the way, [even] the way directly in front of the wall eastward, as one enters them.

13. And he said to me, The north chambers [and] the south chambers which [are] in front of the separate place, they [are] holy chambers, where the priests shall eat, [those] who approach to the LORD shall eat the most holy [things]. There they shall lay the most holy things, and the food offering, and the sin offering, and the guilt offering. For the place [is holy.

14. When the priests enter, then they shall not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but they shall lay their clothes there by which they minister in them, for they are holy. And they shall put on other clothes, and shall approach that which is for the people.

15. And he finished measuring the inner house; he brought me out the way of the gate whose view is eastward, and measured all around.

16. He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds with the measuring reed, all around.

17. He measured the north side, five hundred reeds with the measuring reed all around.

18. He measured the south side, five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.

19. He turned to the west side, measuring five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.

20. He measured it by the four sides. It had a wall all around, five hundred long, and five hundred wide, to make a separation between the holy place and the common place.

## Ezekiel 43

1. And he led me to the gate, the gate that faces eastward.

2. And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. And His voice [was] like the sound of many waters. And the earth shone with His glory.

3. And it looked the same as the vision which I saw, even according to the vision which I saw when I came to destroy the city. And the visions [were] like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar. And I fell on my face.

4. And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose view is eastward.

5. And the Spirit took me up and brought me into the inner chamber. And behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.

6. And I heard [Him] speaking to me from the house. And standing by me [was] a Man.

7. And He said to me, Son of man, the house of Israel shall no more defile the place of My throne, and the place of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel forever; neither they, nor their kings, by their fornication, nor by the dead bodies of their kings in their high places.

8. In their setting of their doorstep by My threshold, and their doorpost by My doorpost; and the wall between Me and them, they have even defiled My holy name by their abominations which they have done. And I have consumed them in My anger.

9. Now [let] them put away their fornication, and the dead bodies of their kings from Me, and I will dwell in their midst forever.

10. You, son of man, declare [to] the house of Israel, the [temple] house, so that they may be ashamed of their iniquities. And let them measure [its] size.

11. And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, the form of the house, and its arrangement, and its exits, and its entrances, and all its forms, and all its statutes, and all its forms, and all its laws, make known to them. And write them before their eyes, so that they may observe all its form, and all its statutes, and do them.

12. This [is] the law of the house. On the top of the mountain [is] all its border, all around, most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.

13. And these are the measures of the altar by the cubit. The cubit [is] a cubit and a span; even the base [shall be] a cubit, and the width a cubit, and its border by its edge all around  shall be] a span. And this [is the upper part of the altar.

14. And from the base on the ground even to the lower ledge [shall be] two cubits, and the width one cubit. And from the smaller ledge even to the greater ledge [shall be] four cubits, and the width one cubit.

15. And the altar hearth [shall be] four cubits, and from the altar hearth and upward [shall be] four horns.

16. And the altar hearth [shall be] twelve cubits long, twelve wide, square in its four sides.

17. And the ledge [shall be] fourteen long and fourteen wide in its four sides. And the border around it [shall be] half a cubit, and its base a cubit around. And its steps shall face eastward.

18. And He said to me, Son of man, so says the Lord Jehovah: These [are] the statutes of the altar in the day of its being made to offer on it burnt offerings, and to sprinkle blood on it.

19. And you shall give a young bull for a sin offering to the priests the Levites, who [are] of the seed of Zadok, who approach Me to minister to Me, says the Lord Jehovah.

20. And you shall take of its blood and put [it] on its four horns, and on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border all around. So you shall cleanse and purge it.

21. You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and he shall burn [it] in the appointed place of the house, outside the sanctuary.

22. And on the second day you shall offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering. And they shall cleanse the altar as they cleansed it with the bull.

23. And when you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a young bull without blemish and a ram out of the flock without blemish.

24. And you shall offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt on them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to the LORD.

25. Every day [for] seven days you shall prepare a goat [for] a sin offering. They also shall prepare a young bull, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.

26. Seven days they shall purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate [themselves].

27. And when these days are expired, it shall be that on the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings before the altar, and your peace offerings. And I will accept you, says the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 44

1. And he brought me back by the way of the gate of the outer sanctuary which looks eastward. And it [was] shut.

2. And the LORD said to me, This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it. Because Jehovah, the God of Israel, has entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.

3. [It is] for the ruler; the ruler shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD. He shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the same way.

4. And He brought me by the way of the north gate before the house. And I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD. And I fell on my face.

5. And the LORD said to me, Son of man, note carefully: see with your eyes, and hear with your ears all that I say to you concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all its laws. And set your heart to the entrance of the house, with all the exits of the sanctuary.

6. And you shall say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, This says the Lord Jehovah: O house of Israel, let it be more than enough for you, of all your hateful deeds,

7. that you have brought strangers, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My sanctuary, to profane it, [even] My house, when you offer My bread, the fat and the blood. And they have broken My covenant because of all your abominations.

8. And you have not kept the charge of My holy things, but you have set keepers of My charge in My sanctuary for themselves.

9. So says the Lord Jehovah: No son of an alien, uncircumcised of heart and uncircumcised of flesh, shall enter into My sanctuary, or any son of an alien among the sons of Israel.

10. But the Levites who have gone far away from Me, when Israel went astray; those who went astray from Me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity.

11. Yet they shall be ministers in My sanctuary, overseers at the gates of the house and ministering to the house. They shall kill the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.

12. Because they ministered to them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity, therefore I have lifted up My hand against them, says the Lord Jehovah, and they shall bear their iniquity.

13. And they shall not come near Me, to do the office of a priest to Me, nor to come near any of My holy things, in the most holy place; but they shall bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed.

14. But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house for all its service, and for all that shall be done in it.

15. But the priests, the Levites, the sons of Zadok, who kept the charge of My sanctuary when the sons of Israel went astray from Me, they shall come near Me to minister to Me, and they shall stand before Me to offer to Me the fat and the blood, says the Lord Jehovah.

16. They shall enter My sanctuary, and they shall come near My table, to minister to Me, and they shall keep My charge.

17. And it shall be, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with bleached [linen] clothing. And no wool shall come on them while they serve in the gates of the inner court, and inside.

18. Turbans of bleached [linen] shall be on their heads, and shall have bleached [linen] undergarments on their loins. They shall not clothe themselves with anything that causes sweat.

19. And when they go out into the outer court, even into the outer court of the people, they shall put off their clothes in which they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers. And they shall put on other clothes, so that they shall not sanctify the people with their own clothes.

20. Nor shall they shave their heads nor allow their hair to grow long; they shall only trim their heads.

21. And every priest shall not drink wine when they enter the inner court.

22. Nor shall they take for their wives a widow nor her who is put away. But they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow who had a priest before.

23. And they shall teach My people to discern between the holy and common, and between the unclean and the clean.

24. And in a dispute they shall stand in judgment; and they shall judge it according to My judgments. And they shall keep My laws and My statutes in all My assemblies, and they shall keep My sabbaths holy.

25. And he shall not come near any dead person to defile [himself;] but he may defile themselves for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister who has had no husband.

26. And after he is cleansed, they shall count seven days for him.

27. And in the day that he goes into the sanctuary, to the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, says the Lord Jehovah.

28. And it shall be to them for an inheritance. I [am] their inheritance. And you shall give them no possession in Israel; I [am] their possession.

29. They shall eat the food offering, and the sin offering, and the guilt offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.

30. And the first of all the firstfruits of all, and every offering of all, of every [kind] of your sacrifices, shall be the priest's. You shall also give the priest the first of your dough, so that he may cause the blessing to rest in your house.

31. The priests shall not eat of anything that died of itself, or is torn, whether it is bird or animal.

## Ezekiel 45

1. And, when you make fall the land by lot for inheritance, you shall offer an offering to the LORD, a holy [portion] of the land. The length [shall be] twenty-five thousand [cubits long, and the width ten thousand. It shall be holy in all its borders all around.

2. Of this there shall be five hundred by five hundred cubits for the sanctuary, square all around; and fifty cubits around shall be for its open space.

3. And from this measure you shall measure the length of twenty-five thousand, and the width of ten thousand. And in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place.

4. It is the holy [portion] of the land for the priests, it shall be for the ministers of the sanctuary who come near to minister to the LORD. And it shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary.

5. And the twenty-five thousand cubits in length, and the ten thousand in width, shall also be for the Levites, the ministers of the house, for themselves for a possession, twenty rooms.

6. And you shall give the possession of the city, five thousand [cubits] wide, and twenty-five thousand long, beside the offering of the holy [portion]. It shall be for the whole house of Israel.

7. And a [portion shall be] for the ruler from here and from there, for [the] heave offering of the holy place, and of the possession of the city, in front of the heave offering of the holy place, and to the front of the city's possession, from the west side westward and from the east side eastward. And the length [shall be] alongside one of the portions, from the west border to the east border.

8. It shall be for a land to him, for a possession in Israel; and My rulers shall never again oppress My people. And they shall give the rest of the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.

9. So says the Lord Jehovah: Enough for you, O rulers of Israel. Remove violence and spoil, and do judgment and justice. Take away your demands on My people, says the Lord Jehovah.

10. You shall have a just balance, a just ephah and a just bath.

11. The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth [part] of a homer, and the ephah the tenth [part] of a homer. Its measure shall be according to the homer.

12. And the shekel [shall be] twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.

13. This [is] the heave offering that you shall offer: the sixth of an ephah of a homer of wheat, and the sixth of an ephah of a homer of barley.

14. And as to the statute of oil, the bath of oil, you shall offer the tenth of a bath out of the cor, which is a homer of ten baths; for ten baths [are] a homer;

15. and one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the watered [pasture] of Israel; for a food offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make atonement for them, says the Lord Jehovah.

16. All the people of the land shall be at the heave offering for the ruler in Israel.

17. And it shall be the ruler's [part] to give burnt offerings and food offerings and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all appointed feasts of the house of Israel. He shall prepare the sin offering and the food offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.

18. So says the Lord Jehovah: In the first [month], in the first of the month, you shall take a bull without blemish, a son of the herd, and cleanse the sanctuary.

19. And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering and put [it] on the doorposts of the house, and on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the gateposts of the inner court.

20. And so you shall do on the seventh of the month for each man who goes astray, and for the simple. So you shall atone for the house.

21. In the first [month], on the fourteenth of the month, you shall have the Passover, a feast of seven days. Unleavened bread shall be eaten.

22. And on that day the ruler shall prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bull [for] a sin offering.

23. And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the LORD, seven bulls and seven rams, without blemish, daily [for] the seven days, and a kid of the goats daily [for] a sin offering.

24. And he shall prepare a food offering of an ephah for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil for an ephah.

25. In the seventh [month], on the fifteenth day of the month, at the feast he shall prepare like these seven days, according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the food offering, and according to the oil.

## Ezekiel 46

1. So says the Lord Jehovah: The gate of the inner court that faces eastward shall be shut the six working days. But on the Sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.

2. And the ruler shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate outside, and shall stand by the gatepost. And the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate. And he shall go out, but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.

3. And the people of the land shall worship [at] the door of that gate before the LORD on the sabbaths and in the new moons.

4. And the burnt offering that the ruler shall offer to the LORD in the sabbath day [shall be] six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.

5. And the food offering [shall be] an ephah for a ram, and the food offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.

6. And in the day of the new moon [it shall be] a bull without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram. They shall be without blemish.

7. And he shall prepare a food offering, an ephah for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as his hand shall be able to get, and a hin of oil to an ephah.

8. And when the ruler shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and by its way he shall go out.

9. But when the people of the land come before the LORD in the appointed feasts, he who enters by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate. And he who enters by the way of the south gate shall go out by the way of the north gate. He shall not return by the way of the gate by which he came in, but shall leave opposite it.

10. And the ruler shall go in among them when they go in. And when they go out, he shall go out.

11. And in the feasts and in the appointed feasts the food offering shall be an ephah to a bull, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.

12. And when the ruler shall prepare a free-will burnt offering or peace offerings willingly to the LORD, [one] shall then open to him the gate that faces eastward, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the Sabbath day. And he shall go out. And after his going out, one shall shut the gate.

13. You shall daily prepare a burnt offering to the LORD, a lamb without blemish, a son of a year. You shall prepare it every morning.

14. And you shall prepare a food offering for it every morning, the sixth of an ephah, and the third of a hin of oil, to make the fine flour moist; a food offering every day by an ordinance forever to the LORD.

15. So they shall prepare the lamb, and the food offering, and the oil, every morning for a burnt offering continually.

16. So says the Lord Jehovah: If the ruler gives a gift to any of his sons, the inheritance of it shall be his sons'; it [shall be] their possession by inheritance.

17. But if he gives a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty. Afterwards. it shall return to the ruler, but his inheritance shall be his sons' for them.

18. And the ruler shall not take of the people's inheritance, oppressing them out of their possession. But he shall give his sons their inheritance out of his own possession; so that My people may not be scattered, each man from his possession.

19. And he brought me through the entry which [was] at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, facing north. And behold, there [was] a place on the two sides westward.

20. And he said to me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the food offering, so that they may not bear [them] out into the outer court to sanctify the people.

21. And he led me out into the outer court and he made me pass by the four corners of the court. And behold, in every corner of the court there [was] a court.

22. In the four corners of the court [were] enclosed courts, forty [cubits] long and thirty wide, one measure to the four of them, being made in corners.

23. And a row [was] all around in them, all around the four of them. And boiling water [was] made under the rows all around.

24. And he said to me, These [are] the places of those who boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.

## Ezekiel 47

1. And he led me again to the door of the house. And behold, water came out from under the threshold of the house eastward. For the front of the house [is] east, and the water came down from under the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar.

2. And he led me out by the way of the north gate, and led me around the way outside to the outer gate, by the way facing the east. And behold, water [was] trickling out of the right side.

3. When the man went out eastward, and a line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits. And he passed me through the water. The water [was to] the ankles.

4. And he measured a thousand cubits, and passed me through the water, water [to] the knees. And he measured a thousand, and passed me through water [to] the loins.

5. And he measured a thousand; and there was a torrent which I [was] not able to pass; for the water had risen, water to swim [in], a torrent that could not be passed.

6. And he said to me, Son of man, have you seen? And he led me, and caused me to return to the bank of the torrent.

7. When I returned, then behold, on the edge of the torrent [were] very many trees, from here and from there.

8. And he said to me, These waters go out toward the eastern circuit, and go down into the Arabah, and go into the sea. They are brought out into the sea, and the waters shall be healed.

9. And it shall be that every living soul which swarms in every [place], there where the two torrents go, [that soul] shall live. And there shall be very many fish, because these waters shall come there. And they shall be healed. And all shall live where the torrent goes.

10. And it will be, the fishermen shall stand on it from En-gedi even to En-eglaim, a spreading place for nets shall be there. Their fish shall be according to their kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea, very many.

11. Its swamps and its marshes shall not even be healed; they shall be given to salt.

12. And all trees [for] food shall go up by the torrent, on its bank on this [side], and on that [side]. Its leaf shall not fade, nor its fruit fail. It will bear by its months, because its waters come out from the sanctuary. And its fruit shall be for food, and its leaf for healing.

13. So says the Lord Jehovah: This [shall be] the border by which you shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph [shall have two] parts.

14. And you shall inherit it, each man like his brother, that I lifted up My hand to give to your fathers; even this land shall fall to you for an inheritance.

15. And this [is] the border of the land to the north side, from the Great Sea, the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad;

16. Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which [is] between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, which [is] by the border of Hauran.

17. And the border shall be from the sea to Hazar-enan, at the border of Damascus and the north northward, even the border of Hamath. And [this is] the north side.

18. And you shall measure the east side from between Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and the land of Israel, [shall be] the Jordan, from the border to the Eastern Sea. And [this is] the east side.

19. And the south side, southward from Tamar, to the waters of Meriboth-kadesh, the torrent to the Great Sea. And [this is] the south side southward.

20. And the west side [is] the Great Sea from the border until one is beside the entrance of Hamath. [This is] the west side.

21. And you shall divide this land for yourselves by the tribes of Israel.

22. And it will be, you shall make it fall by lot for an inheritance to yourselves, and to the strangers who live among you, who shall father sons among you. And they shall be to you as native-born among the sons of Israel. They shall be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.

23. And it shall be, in the tribe in which the stranger resides, there you shall give his inheritance, says the Lord Jehovah.

## Ezekiel 48

1. And these [are] the names of the tribes. From the north end, at the hand of the way of Hethlon [to] the entrance of Hamath, Hazar-enan, the border of Damascus northward, at the hand of Hamath. And there shall be to it an east side and a west: one [part] for Dan.

2. And by the border of Dan, from the east side to the west side, one [part] for Asher.

3. And by the border of Asher, from the east side even to the west side, one [part] for Naphtali.

4. And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side to the west side, one [part] for Manasseh.

5. And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side to the west side, one [part] for Ephraim.

6. And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even to the west side, one [part] for Reuben.

7. And by the border of Reuben from the east side to the west side, one [part] for Judah.

8. And by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the heave offering which you shall offer: twenty-five thousand [cubits] wide and long, as one of the [parts], from the east side to the west side. And the sanctuary shall be in its middle.

9. The heave offering that you shall offer to the LORD shall be twenty-five thousand cubits long, and ten thousand cubits wide.

10. And for these shall be the holy heave offering for the priests; northward, twenty-five thousand; and westward ten thousand wide; and eastward ten thousand wide, and southward twenty-five thousand long. And the sanctuary of the LORD [shall be] in the middle of it,

11. for the priests who are sanctified, of the sons of Zadok, who have kept My charge, who did not go astray when the sons of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.

12. And the heave offering shall be theirs, from the heave offering of the land, the holiest of the holy places, by the border of the Levites.

13. And the Levites [shall have] alongside the border of the priests twenty-five thousand [cubits] long, and ten thousand wide. All the length shall be twenty-five thousand, and the width ten thousand.

14. And they shall not sell any of it, nor trade it, nor cause the first-fruits of the land to pass away. For [it is] holy to the LORD.

15. And the five thousand that are left in the width in front of the twenty-five thousand [shall be] common for the city, for dwelling and for open land. And the city shall be in her midst.

16. And these shall be its measures: the north side, four thousand and five hundred; and the south side, four thousand and five hundred; and on the east side, four thousand and five hundred; and the west side, four thousand and five hundred.

17. And the open land of the city shall be northward two hundred and fifty, and southward two hundred and fifty; and eastward, two hundred and fifty; and westward, two hundred and fifty.

18. And the rest in length alongside the heave offering of the holy [parts shall be] ten thousand eastward and ten thousand westward. And it shall be alongside the heave offering of the holy  part]. And its produce shall be for bread to those who serve the city.

19. And he who serves the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel.

20. All the heave offering [shall be] twenty-five thousand by twenty-five thousand, four-square. You shall offer the holy heave offering to the possession of the city.

21. And the rest [shall be] for the ruler, on this [side], and on that [side] of the holy heave offering, and of the possession of the city, in the front of the twenty-five thousand of the heave offering to the east border, and westward in the front of the twenty-five thousand to the west border, alongside the [lots] for the ruler. And it shall be the holy heave offering. And the sanctuary of the house [shall be] in her midst.

22. And to the ruler shall be from the possessions of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, amidst [that] for the ruler; between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, shall be for the ruler.

23. And the rest of the tribes, from the east side to the west side, Benjamin, one [part].

24. And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west side, Simeon, one [part].

25. And by the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side, Issachar, one [part].

26. And by the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west side, Zebulun, one [part].

27. And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the west side, Gad, one [part].

28. And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar to the waters of Meriboth-kadesh, and to the torrent toward the Great Sea.

29. This [is] the land which you shall divide by lot to the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these [are] their parts, says the Lord Jehovah.

30. And these [are] the exits of the city on the north side, four thousand and five hundred measures.

31. And the gates of the city [shall be] by the names of the tribes of Israel: three gates northward, one gate of Reuben, one gate of Judah, one gate of Levi.

32. And at the east side four thousand and five hundred, and three gates: and one gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, one gate of Dan.

33. And the south side, four thousand and five hundred measures, and three gates: the gate of Simeon, one; the gate of Issachar, one; the gate of Zebulun, one.

34. The west side, four thousand and five hundred, their gates three: the gate of Gad, one; the gate of Asher, one; the gate of Naphtali, one.

35. All around [it shall be] eighteen thousand [cubits]. And the name of the city from [that] day [is] JEHOVAH IS THERE.
