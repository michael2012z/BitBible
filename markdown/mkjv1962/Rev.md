# Revelation

## Revelation 1

1. A Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to Him to declare to His servants things which must shortly come to pass. And He signified [it] by sending His angel to His servant John,

2. who bore record of the Word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all the things that he saw.

3. Blessed [is] the [one] who reads and hears the words of this prophecy, and the ones keeping the things written in it, for the time [is] near.

4. John to the seven churches which are in Asia. Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who [is] coming; and from the seven spirits which are before His throne;

5. even from Jesus Christ the faithful Witness, the First-born from the dead and the Ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood,

6. and made us kings and priests to God and His Father, to Him [be] glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.

7. Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, and those who pierced Him will see Him, and all the kindreds of the earth will wail because of Him. Even so, Amen.

8. I am the Alpha and Omega, [the] Beginning and [the] Ending, says the Lord, who is and who was and who [is] to come, the Almighty.

9. I, John, [who] also [am] your brother and companion in the affliction, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the island that is called Patmos, for the Word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.

10. I came to be in [the] Spirit in the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,

11. saying, I am the Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last. Also, What you see, write in a book and send [it] to the seven churches which are in Asia: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.

12. And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me.

13. And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands. And in the midst of the seven lampstands I saw [One] like [the] Son of man, clothed with a garment down to [the] feet, and tied around the breast with a golden band.

14. His head and hair [were] white like wool, as white as snow. And His eyes [were] like a flame of fire.

15. And His feet were like burnished brass having been fired in a furnace. And His voice was like the sound of many waters.

16. And He had seven stars in His right hand, and out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword. And His face [was] like the sun shining in its strength.

17. And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. And He laid His right hand upon me, saying to me, Do not fear, I am the First and the Last,

18. and the Living One, and I became dead, and behold, I am alive for ever and ever, Amen. And I have the keys of hell and of death.

19. Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be after this,

20. the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand and the seven golden lampstands. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands which you saw are the seven churches.

## Revelation 2

1. To the angel of the church of Ephesus write: He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands, says these things.

2. I know your works and your labor and your patience, and how you cannot bear those who are evil. And [you] tried those pretending to be apostles, and are not, and have found them liars.

3. And [you] have borne, and have patience, and for My name's sake you have labored and have not fainted.

4. But I have against you that you left your first love.

5. Therefore remember from where you have fallen, and repent, and do the first works, or else I will come to you quickly and will remove your lampstand out of its place unless you repent.

6. But you have this, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.

7. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give to eat of the Tree of Life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.

8. And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: The First and the Last, who became dead and lived, says these things:

9. I know your works and tribulation and poverty (but you are rich), and [I know] the blasphemy of those saying themselves to be Jews, and are not, but [are] the synagogue of Satan.

10. Do not at all fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the Devil will cast [some] of you into prison, so that you may be tried. And you will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful to death, and I will give you the crown of life.

11. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt by the second death.

12. And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write: He who has the sharp sword with two edges says these things.

13. I know your works, and where you live, [even] where Satan's seat [is]. And you hold fast My name and have not denied My faith, even in those days in which Antipas [was] My faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.

14. But I have a few things against you, because you have there those who hold the teachings of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit fornication.

15. So you also have those who hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.

16. Repent! But if not I will come to you quickly, and will fight with them by the sword of My mouth.

17. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give to him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows except he who receives [it].

18. And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: The Son of God, He who has His eyes like a flame of fire and His feet like burnished metal, says these things:

19. I know your works and love and service and faith and your patience, and your works; and the last [to be] more than the first.

20. But I have a few things against you because you allow that woman Jezebel to teach, she saying herself [to be] a prophetess, and to cause My servants to go astray, and to commit fornication, and to eat idol-sacrifices.

21. And I gave her time that she might repent of her fornication, and she did not repent.

22. Behold, I am throwing her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great affliction, unless they repent of their deeds.

23. And I will kill her children with death. And all the churches will know that I am He who searches the reins and hearts, and I will give to every one of you according to your works.

24. But to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this doctrine, and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak, I will put on you no other burden.

25. But that which you have, hold fast until I come.

26. And he who overcomes and keeps My works to the end, to him I will give power over the nations.

27. And he will rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels [of a potter] they will be broken to pieces, even as I received from My Father.

28. And I will give him the Morning Star.

29. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

## Revelation 3

1. And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars says these things. I know your works, that you have a name that you live, and are dead.

2. Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die. For I have not found your works being fulfilled before God.

3. Remember then how you have received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. Therefore if you will not watch, I will come upon you as a thief, and you will not know what hour I will come upon you.

4. You have a few names even in Sardis who have not defiled their garments. And they will walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.

5. The one who overcomes, this one will be clothed in white clothing. And I will not blot out his name out of the Book of Life, but I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.

6. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

7. And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: He who is holy, He who is true, He who has the key of David, He who opens and no one shuts; and shuts and no one opens, says these things:

8. I know your works. Behold, I have given before you an open door, and no one can shut it. For you have a little strength and have kept My word and have not denied My name.

9. Behold, I give out of those of the synagogue of Satan, those saying themselves to be Jews and are not, but lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.

10. Because you have kept the word of My patience, I also will keep you from the hour of temptation which will come upon all the habitable world, to try those who dwell upon the earth.

11. Behold, I come quickly. Hold fast to that which you have, so that no one may take your crown.

12. Him who overcomes I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he will go out no more. And I will write upon him the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which comes down out of Heaven from My God, and My new name.

13. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

14. And to the angel of the church of the Laodicea write: The Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Head of the creation of God, says these things:

15. I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I would that you were cold or hot.

16. So because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of My mouth.

17. Because you say, I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing, and do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked,

18. I counsel you to buy from Me gold purified by fire, so that you may be rich; and white clothing, so that you may be clothed, and [so that] the shame of your nakedness does not appear. And anoint your eyes with eye salve, so that you may see.

19. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; therefore be zealous and repent.

20. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him and he with Me.

21. To him who overcomes I will grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I also overcame and have sat down with My Father in His throne.

22. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

## Revelation 4

1. After these things I looked, and behold, a door [was] opened in Heaven. And the first voice which I heard [was] as it were of a trumpet talking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show you what must occur after these things.

2. And immediately I became in spirit. And behold, a throne was set in Heaven, and [One] sat upon the throne.

3. And He who sat there looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. And a rainbow [was] around the throne, looking like an emerald.

4. And around the throne [I saw] twenty-four thrones. And on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white clothing. And they had crowns of gold on their heads.

5. And out of the throne came lightnings and thunderings and voices. And seven lamps of fire [were] burning in front of the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.

6. And a sea of glass [was] in front of the throne, like crystal. And in [the] midst of the throne, and around the throne, [were] four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind.

7. And the first living creature [was] like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature had the face of a man, and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle.

8. And each one of the four living creatures had six wings about [him], and within being full of eyes. And they had no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God, the Almighty, who was and is and [is] to come.

9. And whenever the living creatures gave glory and honor and thanks to Him who sat on the throne, who lives forever and ever,

10. the twenty-four elders fell down before the One sitting on the throne. And they worshiped Him who lives for ever and ever, and threw their crowns before the throne, saying,

11. O Lord, You are worthy to receive glory and honor and power, because You created all things, and for Your will they are and were created.

## Revelation 5

1. And I saw a book on the right of Him sitting on the throne, written inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals.

2. And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book and to loosen its seals?

3. And no one in Heaven, nor on the earth, nor under the earth, was able to open the book or to look at it.

4. And I wept very much, because no one was found worthy to open and to read the book, nor to look at it.

5. And one of the elders said to me, Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals of it.

6. And I looked, and lo, in [the] midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, amidst the elders, a Lamb stood, as if it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.

7. And He came and took the book out of the right [hand] of Him sitting on the throne.

8. And when He had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one having harps and golden vials full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.

9. And they sang a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book and to open its seals, for You were slain and have redeemed us to God by Your blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation.

10. And You made us kings and priests to our God, and we will reign over the earth.

11. And I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne, and the living creatures and the elders. And the number of them was myriads and myriads, and thousands of thousands,

12. saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.

13. And I heard every creature which is in the Heaven and on the earth, and under the earth, and those that are in the sea, and all who are in them, saying, Blessing and honor and glory and power be to Him sitting on the throne, and to the Lamb forever and ever.

14. And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped [the] One living forever and ever.

## Revelation 6

1. And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures like a sound of thunder, saying, Come and see.

2. And I saw. And behold a white horse! And he sitting on it had a bow. And a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer.

3. And when He had opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, Come and see.

4. And another, a red horse, went out. And power was given to him sitting on it, to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another. And there was given to him a great sword.

5. And when He had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, Come and see. And I looked, and lo, a black horse. And he sitting on it had a balance in his hand.

6. And I heard a voice in [the] midst of the four living creatures say, A choenix of wheat [for] a denarius, and three choenixes of barley [for] a denarius. And do not hurt the oil and the wine.

7. And when He had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, Come and see.

8. And I looked, and behold, a pale horse. And the name of him sitting on it [was] Death, and Hell followed with him. And authority was given to them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and by the beasts of the earth.

9. And when He had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held.

10. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, Until when, Master, holy and true, do You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?

11. And white robes were given to each one of them. And it was said to them that they should rest yet for a little time, until both their fellow servants and their brothers (those about to be killed as they [were] ) should have their number made complete.

12. And when He had opened the sixth seal, I looked, and behold, there was a great earthquake. And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became like blood.

13. And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, even as a fig tree casts her untimely figs when she is shaken by a mighty wind.

14. And [the] heaven departed like a scroll when it is rolled together. And every mountain and island were moved out of their places.

15. And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every freeman, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains.

16. And they said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us and hide us from [the] face of Him sitting on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb;

17. for the great day of His wrath has come, and who will be able to stand?

## Revelation 7

1. And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth so that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.

2. And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,

3. saying, Do not hurt the earth or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.

4. And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred [and] forty-four thousands, having been sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel.

5. Out of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand had been sealed. Out of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand had been sealed. Out of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand had been sealed.

6. Out of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand had been sealed. Out of the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand had been sealed. Out of the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand had been sealed.

7. Out of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand had been sealed. Out of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand had been sealed. Out of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand had been sealed.

8. Out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand had been sealed. Out of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand had been sealed. Out of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand had been sealed.

9. After these things I looked, and lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, out of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues, stood before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with palms in their hands.

10. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God sitting on the throne, and to the Lamb.

11. And all the angels stood around the throne, and the elders, and the four living creatures, and they fell before the throne on their faces and worshiped God,

12. saying, Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might [be] to our God forever and ever. Amen.

13. And one of the elders answered, saying to me, Who are these who are arrayed in white robes, and from where do they come?

14. And I said to him, Sir, you know. And he said to me, These are the ones who came out of the great tribulation and have washed their robes, and have whitened them in the blood of the Lamb.

15. Therefore they are before the throne of God, and they serve Him day and night in His temple. And He sitting on the throne will dwell among them.

16. They will not hunger any more, nor thirst any more, nor will the sun light on them, nor any heat.

17. For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will feed them and will lead them to [the] fountains of living waters. And God will wipe away all tears from their eyes.

## Revelation 8

1. And when He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in Heaven for about half an hour.

2. And I saw the seven angels who stood before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.

3. And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer. And many incenses were given to him, so that he should offer [it] with the prayers of all saints on the golden altar before the throne.

4. And the smoke of the incense [which came] with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God from the angel's hand.

5. And the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar, and cast [it] into the earth. And voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake occurred.

6. And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.

7. The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mixed with blood, and they were cast on the earth. And the third [part] of trees was burned up, and all green grass was burned up.

8. And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea. And the third [part] of the sea became blood.

9. And the third [part] of the creatures in the sea, those having souls, died; and the third [part] of the ships was destroyed.

10. And the third angel sounded, and a great star burning like a lamp fell from the heaven, and it fell on the third [part] of the rivers and on the fountains of waters.

11. And the name of the star is called Wormwood, and a third [part] of the waters became wormwood. And many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.

12. And the fourth angel sounded, and the third [part] of the sun was stricken, and the third [part] of the moon, and the third [part] of the stars, so that the third [part] of them was darkened, and the day did not appear for a third [part] of it, and the night also.

13. And I saw and I heard one angel flying in mid-heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, from the rest of the voices of the trumpet of the three angels being about to sound!

## Revelation 9

1. And the fifth angel sounded. And I saw a star fall from the heaven to the earth, and it was given the key of the abyss.

2. And it opened the bottomless pit. And there arose a smoke out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace. And the sun and air were darkened because of the smoke of the pit.

3. And out of the smoke came forth locusts onto the earth. And authority was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have authority.

4. And they were commanded not to hurt the grass of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God in their foreheads.

5. And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months. And their torment [was] like a scorpion's torment when he stings a man.

6. And in those days men will seek death and will not find it. And they will long to die, and death will flee from them.

7. And the shapes of the locusts [were] like horses prepared for battle. And on their heads were as it [were] crowns like gold, and their faces [were] like the faces of men.

8. And they had hairs like the hairs of women, and their teeth were like [the teeth] of lions.

9. And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron. And the sound of their wings [was] like the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.

10. And they had tails like scorpions, and there were stings in their tails. And their authority [was] to hurt men five months.

11. And they had a king over them, the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue [is] Abaddon, but in Greek his name [is] Apollyon.

12. The first woe is past. Behold, after these things yet come two woes.

13. And the sixth angel sounded his trumpet. And I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God,

14. saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Loose the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.

15. And the four angels were loosed, who were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, in order to slay the third [part] of men.

16. And the number of the armies of the horsemen [was] two myriads of myriads. And I heard their number.

17. And so I saw the horses in the vision, and those sitting on them, having breastplates of fire, even dusky red and brimstone. And the heads of the horses [were] like the heads of lions. And out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.

18. By these three the third [part] of men was killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths.

19. For their authority is in their mouth and in their tails. For their tails [were] like serpents with heads, and with them they do harm.

20. And the rest of the men who were not killed by these plagues [still] did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and golden, and silver, and bronze, and stone, and wooden idols (which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk).

21. And they did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.

## Revelation 10

1. And I saw another mighty angel coming down out of the heaven, clothed with a cloud. And a rainbow [was] on his head, and his face [was] as the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.

2. And he had a little book open in his hand. And he set his right foot on the sea and [his] left [foot] on the earth.

3. And he cried with a loud voice, like a lion roaring. And when he had cried, seven thunders spoke their sounds.

4. And when the seven thunders spoke their sounds, I was about to write. And I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, Seal up what things the seven thunders spoke, and do not write these things.

5. And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the earth lifted his hand to the heaven,

6. and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created the heaven and the things in it, and the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, that there should no longer be time.

7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he will begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as He has declared to His servants the prophets.

8. And the voice which I heard from Heaven spoke to me again, and said, Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the earth.

9. And I went to the angel and said to him, Give me the little book. And he said to me, Take [it] and eat it up, and it will make your belly bitter, but it will be sweet as honey in your mouth.

10. And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up. And it was sweet as honey in my mouth, and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was made bitter.

11. And he said to me, You must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.

## Revelation 11

1. And a reed like a rod was given to me. And the angel stood, saying, Rise up and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those who worship in it.

2. But leave out the court which is outside the temple, and do not measure it, for it was given to the nations. And they will trample the holy city forty-two months.

3. And I will give [power] to My two witnesses, and they will prophesy a thousand, two hundred and sixty days, clothed [in] sackcloth.

4. These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the God of the earth.

5. And if anyone will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies. And if anyone will hurt them, so it is right for him to be killed.

6. These have authority to shut up the heaven, that it may not rain in the days of their prophecy. And they have authority over waters to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.

7. And when they complete their testimony, the beast coming up out of the abyss will make war against them and will overcome them and kill them.

8. And their bodies [will lie] in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.

9. And many of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will see their dead bodies three days and a half, and they will not allow their dead bodies to be put in tombs.

10. And the ones who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them, and will make merry, and will send one another gifts, because these two prophets tormented those living on the earth.

11. And after three days and a half, a spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet. And great fear fell on those seeing them.

12. And they heard a great voice from Heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they went up to Heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them.

13. And in that hour a great earthquake occurred, and the tenth [part] of the city fell. And seven thousand names of men were slain in the earthquake. And the rest were frightened and gave glory to the God of Heaven.

14. The second woe passed away. Behold, the third woe comes quickly.

15. And the seventh angel sounded. And there were great voices in Heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world have become [the kingdoms] of our Lord, and of His Christ. And He will reign forever and ever.

16. And the twenty-four elders sitting before God on their thrones, fell on their faces and worshiped God,

17. saying, We thank You, O Lord God Almighty, who are, and who was, and who is coming, because You took Your great power and reigned.

18. And the nations were full of wrath, and Your wrath came, and the time of the judging of the dead, and to give the reward to Your servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to the ones fearing Your name, to the small and to the great, and to destroy those destroying the earth.

19. And the temple of God was opened in Heaven, and there was seen in His temple the ark of His covenant, and there occurred lightnings and voices, and thunders and an earthquake, and a great hail.

## Revelation 12

1. And there appeared a great sign in the heavens, a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon was under her feet, and a crown of twelve stars on her head,

2. and having [a babe] in womb, she cries, being in travail, having been distressed to bear.

3. And another sign was seen in the heavens. And behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads!

4. And his tail drew the third [part] of the stars of heaven, and cast them onto the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman being about to bear, so that when she bears he might devour her child.

5. And she bore a son, a male, who is going to rule all nations with a rod of iron. And her child was caught up to God and [to] His throne.

6. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared by God, so that they might nourish her there a thousand, two hundred [and] sixty days.

7. And there was war in Heaven. Michael and his angels warring against the dragon. And the dragon and his angels warred,

8. but did not prevail. Nor was place found for them in Heaven any more.

9. And the great dragon was cast out, the old serpent called Devil, and Satan, who deceives the whole world. He was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.

10. And I heard a great voice saying in Heaven, Now has come the salvation and power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Christ. For the accuser of our brothers is cast down, who accused them before our God day and night.

11. And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony. And they did not love their soul until death.

12. Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and those tabernacling in them. Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and in the sea! For the Devil came down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has but a little time.

13. And when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who bore the man [child].

14. And two wings of a great eagle were given to the woman, so that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the serpent's face.

15. And the serpent cast out of his mouth water like a flood after the woman, so that he might cause her to be carried away by the river.

16. And the earth helped the woman. And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.

17. And the dragon was enraged over the woman, and went to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

## Revelation 13

1. And I stood on the sand of the sea, and I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns. And on its horns were ten crowns, and on its heads was the name of blasphemy.

2. And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and its feet like [those] of a bear, and its mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him its power and its seat and great authority.

3. And I saw one of its heads as having been slain to death, and its deadly wound was healed. And all the earth marveled after the beast.

4. And they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the beast. And they worshiped the beast, saying, Who [is] like the beast? Who is able to make war with it?

5. And a mouth speaking great things was given to it, and blasphemies. And authority was given to it to continue forty-two months.

6. And it opened its mouth in blasphemy toward God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, and those dwelling in Heaven.

7. And it was given to it to war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given to it over every tribe and tongue and nation.

8. And all dwelling on the earth will worship it, those whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain, from the foundation of the world.

9. If anyone has an ear, let him hear.

10. He who leads into captivity will go into captivity. If anyone will kill with the sword, he must be killed by a sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.

11. And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. And it had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon.

12. And it exercises all the authority of the first beast before him, and causes the earth and those dwelling in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.

13. And it does great wonders, so that it makes fire come down from the heaven onto the earth in the sight of men.

14. And it deceives those dwelling on the earth, because of the miracles which were given to it to do before the beast, saying to those dwelling on the earth that they should make an image to the beast who had the wound by a sword and lived.

15. And there was given to it to give a spirit to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might both speak, and might cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.

16. And it causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark on their right hand, or in their foreheads,

17. even that not any might buy or sell except those having the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of its name.

18. Here is the wisdom. Let him having reason count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. And its number [is] six hundred [and] sixty-six.

## Revelation 14

1. And I looked, and lo, the Lamb stood on Mount Zion. And with Him were a hundred [and] forty-four thousands, having His Father's name written in their foreheads.

2. And I heard a voice from Heaven, like the voice of many waters and like the voice of a great thunder. And I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps.

3. And they sang as it were a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. And no one could learn that song except the hundred [and] forty-four thousands who were redeemed from the earth.

4. These are those who were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These were redeemed from among men, [as a] firstfruit to God and to the Lamb.

5. And in their mouth was found no guile, for they were without blemish before the throne of God.

6. And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those dwelling on the earth, even to every nation and kindred and tongue and people,

7. saying with a great voice, Fear God and give glory to Him! For the hour of His judgment has come. And worship Him who made the heaven and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.

8. And another angel followed, saying, The great city, Babylon, has fallen, has fallen; because of the wine of the anger of her fornication; she has made all nations to drink.

9. And a third angel followed them, saying with a great voice, If anyone worships the beast and its image, and receives a mark in his forehead or in his hand,

10. he also will drink of the wine of the anger of God, having been mixed undiluted in the cup of His wrath. And he will be tormented by fire and brimstone before the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.

11. And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. And they have no rest day or night, those who worship the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.

12. Here is the patience of the saints. Here [are] the ones who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.

13. And I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed [are] the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Yes, says the Spirit, they shall rest from their labors, and their works follow them.

14. And I looked, and behold, a white cloud. And on the cloud sat one like the Son of man, having a golden crown on His head, and a sharp sickle in His hand.

15. And another angel came out of the temple, crying in a great voice to Him sitting on the cloud, Thrust in Your sickle and reap, for the time has come for You to reap, for the harvest of the earth was dried.

16. And He sitting on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.

17. And another angel came out of the temple in Heaven, also having a sharp sickle.

18. And another angel came out from the altar, who had authority over fire. And he spoke with a great cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe.

19. And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast [it] into the great winepress of the anger of God.

20. And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even to the bridles of the horses, for the space of a thousand, six hundred stadia.

## Revelation 15

1. And I saw another sign in Heaven, great and marvelous: seven angels with the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.

2. And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire. And those who had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, [and] over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.

3. And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous [are] Your works, Lord God Almighty, just and true [are] Your ways, O King of saints.

4. Who shall not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You only [are] holy. For all nations shall come and worship before You, for Your righteousnesses were made known.

5. And after these things I looked, and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony was opened in Heaven.

6. And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and were tied at the breasts with golden bands.

7. And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.

8. And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from His authority. And no one was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.

## Revelation 16

1. And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the vials of the anger of God on the earth.

2. And the first went and poured out his vial on the earth. And a bad and grievous sore fell on the men who had the mark of the beast, and [on] those who worshiped his image.

3. And the second angel poured out his vial on the sea. And it became like the blood of a dead one, and every living soul died in the sea.

4. And the third angel poured out his vial on the rivers and fountains of waters, and they became blood.

5. And I heard the angel of the waters say, Righteous is the Lord, who is, and was, and who will be, because You have judged these things,

6. since they have poured out the blood of the saints and prophets; and You gave them blood to drink, for they were deserving.

7. And I heard another out of the altar saying, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous [are] Your judgments.

8. And the fourth angel poured out his vial onto the sun. And it was given to him to burn men with fire.

9. And men were burned with great heat. And they blasphemed the name of God, He having authority over these plagues. And they did not repent in order to give Him glory.

10. And the fifth angel poured out his vial on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom became darkened. And they gnawed their tongues from the pain.

11. And they blasphemed the God of Heaven because of their pains and their sores. And they did not repent of their deeds.

12. And the sixth angel poured out his vial on the great river Euphrates. And its water was dried up, so that the way of the kings from [the] rising of [the] sun might be prepared.

13. And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs [come] out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.

14. For they are spirits of demons, working miracles, [which] go forth to the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that day, the great day of God Almighty.

15. Behold, I am coming as a thief. Blessed [is] the [one] who watches and keeps his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame.

16. And he gathered them into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.

17. And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air. And a great voice came out of the temple of Heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done!

18. And voices and thunders and lightnings occurred. And there was a great earthquake, such as has not been since men were on the earth, so mighty [and] so great an earthquake.

19. And the great city came to be into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And great Babylon was remembered before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the anger of His wrath.

20. And every island fled away, and mountains were not found.

21. And a great hail, as the size of a talent, came down out of the heaven on men. And men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague of it was exceedingly great.

## Revelation 17

1. And one of the seven angels who had the seven vials came and talked with me, saying to me, Come here, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot sitting on many waters,

2. with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and became drunk with the wine of her fornication, those inhabiting the earth.

3. And he carried me away into a desert by [the] Spirit. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored beast, filled with names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.

4. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet. And she was gilded with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication.

5. And on her forehead [was] a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.

6. And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I marveled with a great marveling.

7. And the angel said to me, Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, that has the seven heads and ten horns.

8. The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to ascend out of the abyss and go into perdition. And those dwelling on the earth will marvel, those whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.

9. [And] here [is] the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.

10. And there are seven kings; five have fallen, and one is, [and] the other has not yet come. And when he comes, he must continue a short time.

11. And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into perdition.

12. And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, who have received no kingdom yet, but will receive authority as kings one hour with the beast.

13. These have one mind, and they will give their power and authority to the beast.

14. These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them. For He is Lord of lords and King of kings. And those with Him [are] the called and elect and faithful ones.

15. And he says to me, The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues,

16. and the ten horns which you saw on the beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked. And they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire.

17. For God gave into their hearts to do His mind, and to act with one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God will be fulfilled.

18. And the woman whom you saw is the great city which has a kingdom over the kings of the earth.

## Revelation 18

1. And after these things I saw another angel come down from Heaven, having great authority. And the earth was lighted up from his glory.

2. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great has fallen, has fallen! And it has become the dwelling-place of demons, and a prison of every unclean spirit, and a cage of every unclean bird which has been hated,

3. because of the wine of the anger of her fornication which all the nations have drunk. And the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her. And the merchants of the earth became rich from the power of her luxury.

4. And I heard another voice from Heaven, saying, Come out of her, My people, that you may not be partakers of her sins, and that you may not receive of her plagues.

5. For her sins joined together, even up to Heaven, and God has remembered her unjust deeds.

6. Reward her as she has rewarded you, and double to her double, according to her works. In the cup which she mixed, mix double to her.

7. As much as she has glorified herself and has lived in luxury, so much torment and sorrow give her. For she says in her heart, I sit as a queen, and I am not a widow; and I do not see mourning at all.

8. Therefore her plagues will come in one day, death and mourning and famine. And she will be consumed with fire, for the Lord God who judges her [is] strong.

9. And the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and lived in luxury with her will weep for her, and will wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning;

10. standing afar off for fear of her torment, saying, Woe! Woe to the great city, Babylon, that strong city! For in one hour your judgment came.

11. And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their cargo any more;

12. the cargo of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and every ivory vessel, and every vessel of very precious wood, and of bronze, and of iron, and of marble,

13. and cinnamon, and incenses, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.

14. And the fruits of the lust of your soul have departed from you, and all the fat things and the bright things departed from you, and you will find them no more, not at all.

15. The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, will stand afar off because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning

16. and saying, Woe! Woe to the great city which was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls!

17. For in one hour such great riches was desolated. And every ship-pilot, and all the company on the ships, and sailors, and as many as work the sea, stood afar off.

18. And they cried out, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What [is] like the great city?

19. And they threw dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe! Woe to the great city, by which all who had ships in the sea were rich out of her costliness! For in one hour she was ruined.

20. Rejoice over her, Heaven, and the holy apostles, and the prophets, since God judged your judgment on her.

21. And one strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw [it] into the sea, saying, So on an impulse the great city, Babylon, will be thrown down and not at all will be found any more.

22. And the voice of harpers, and of musicians. and flutists, and of trumpeters will be heard no more at all in you. And every craftsman of any craft will not be found any more in you. And the sound of a mill will never more be heard at all in you.

23. And the light of a lamp will never more shine at all in you. And the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will never more be heard at all in you. For your merchants were the great ones of the earth; for by your sorceries all nations were deceived.

24. And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all those who were slain on the earth.

## Revelation 19

1. And after these things I heard a great sound of a numerous crowd in Heaven, saying, Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and honor and the power to the Lord our God!

2. For true and righteous [are] His judgments. For He has judged the great harlot who defiled the earth with her fornication, and He has avenged the blood of His servants out of her hand.

3. And secondly they said, Hallelujah! And her smoke rose up forever and ever.

4. And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God sitting on the throne, saying, Amen! Hallelujah!

5. And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all His servants, and the ones fearing Him, the small and great.

6. And I heard as the sound of a great multitude, and as the sound of many waters, and as the sound of strong thunders, saying, Hallelujah! For the Lord God omnipotent reigns!

7. Let us be glad and rejoice and we will give glory to Him. For the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has prepared herself.

8. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. For the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints.

9. And he said to me, Write, Blessed [are] those who have been called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true sayings of God.

10. And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, See, do not do it! I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

11. And I saw Heaven opened. And behold, a white horse! And He sitting on him [was] called Faithful and True. And in righteousness He judges and makes war.

12. And His eyes [were] like a flame of fire, and on His head many crowns. And He had a name written, one that no one knew except Himself.

13. And He had been clothed [in] a garment dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.

14. And the armies in Heaven followed Him on white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

15. And out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, so that with it He should strike the nations. And He will shepherd them with a rod of iron. And He treads the winepress of the wine of the anger and of the wrath of Almighty God.

16. And He has on [His] garment, and on His thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.

17. And I saw one angel standing in the sun. And he cried with a great voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven, Come and gather together to the supper of the great God,

18. so that you may eat the flesh of kings, and [the] flesh of commanders, and [the] flesh of strong ones, and [the] flesh of horses, and those sitting on them, and [the] flesh of all, both free and slave, both small and great.

19. And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth and their armies, being gathered to make war against Him who sat on the horse, and against His army.

20. And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet doing signs before it, (by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast), and those who had worshiped his image. The two were thrown alive into the Lake of Fire burning with brimstone.

21. And the rest were slain by the sword of Him who sat on the horse, it proceeding out of His mouth. And all the birds were filled from their flesh.

## Revelation 20

1. And I saw an angel come down from Heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.

2. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years.

3. And he cast him into the abyss and shut him up and set a seal on him, that he should deceive the nations no more until the thousand years should be fulfilled. And after that he must be loosed a little time.

4. And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. And [I saw] the souls of those who had been beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the Word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast nor his image, nor had received [his] mark on their foreheads, nor in their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.

5. But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished. This [is] the first resurrection.

6. Blessed and holy [is] he who has part in the first resurrection. The second death has no authority over these, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and will reign with Him a thousand years.

7. And when the thousand years have expired, Satan will be loosed out of his prison.

8. And he will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle. The number of them [is] as the sand of the sea.

9. And they went up over the breadth of the earth and circled around the camp of the saints, and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of Heaven and devoured them.

10. And the Devil who deceived them was cast into the Lake of Fire and Brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [were]. And he will be tormented day and night forever and ever.

11. And I saw a great white throne, and Him sitting on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. And a place was not found for them.

12. And I saw the dead, the small and the great, stand before God. And books were opened, and another book was opened, [which is] the Book of Life. And the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.

13. And the sea gave up the dead in it. And death and hell delivered up the dead in them. And each one of them was judged according to their works.

14. And death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire. This is the second death.

15. And if anyone was not found having been written in the Book of Life, he was cast into the Lake of Fire.

## Revelation 21

1. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. And the sea no longer is.

2. And I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of Heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her Husband.

3. And I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God [is] with men, and He will dwell with them, and they will be His people, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.

4. And God will wipe away all tears from their eyes. And there will be no more death, nor mourning, nor crying out, nor will there be any more pain; for the first things passed away.

5. And He sitting on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And He said to me, Write, for these words are true and faithful.

6. And He said to me, It is done. I am the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End. To him who thirsts I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely.

7. He who overcomes will inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he will be My son.

8. But the fearful, and the unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, will have their part in the Lake burning with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.

9. And one of the seven angels who had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues came to me and talked with me, saying, Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife.

10. And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of Heaven from God,

11. having the glory of God. And its light [was] like a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.

12. And it] had a great and high wall, with twelve gates. And on the gates were twelve angels, and having names inscribed, which are the names] of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel:

13. From the east three gates, from the north three gates, from the south three gates, and from the west three gates.

14. And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

15. And he who talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city and its gates and its wall.

16. And the city lies four-square, and the length is as large as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand stadia. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.

17. And he measured its wall, a hundred [and] forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.

18. And the foundation of its wall was jasper; and the city [was] pure gold, like clear glass.

19. And the foundations of the wall of the city had been adorned with every precious stone. The first foundation, jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;

20. the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, hyacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.

21. And the twelve gates [were] twelve pearls. Respectively, each one of the gates was one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, as transparent glass.

22. And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty is its temple, even the Lamb.

23. And the city had no need of the sun, nor of the moon, that they might shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it, and its lamp [is] the Lamb.

24. And the nations of those who are saved will walk in the light of it; and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it.

25. And its gates may not be shut at all by day, for there shall be no night there.

26. And they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.

27. And there shall in no way enter into it anything that defiles, or any making an abomination or a lie; but only those who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life.

## Revelation 22

1. And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.

2. In the midst of its street, and of the river, from here and from there, [was] the Tree of Life, which bore twelve fruits, each yielding its fruit according to one month. And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.

3. And every curse will no longer be; but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His servants will serve Him.

4. And they will see His face, and His name [will be] in their foreheads.

5. And there will be no night there. And they need no lamp, or light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light. And they will reign forever and ever.

6. And he said to me, These sayings [are] faithful and true. And the Lord God of the holy prophets sent His angel to show to His servants the things which must shortly be done.

7. Behold, I come quickly. Blessed [is] he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this Book.

8. And I, John, saw and heard these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel showing me these things.

9. Then he said to me, Behold! See, do not do it! For I am your fellow-servant, and of your brothers the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this Book. Do worship to God.

10. And he said to me, Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this Book; for the time is at hand.

11. He acting unjustly, let him still act unjustly. And the filthy, let him be filthy still. And the righteous, let him be righteous still. And the holy, let him be holy still.

12. And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward [is] with Me, to give to each according as his work is.

13. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, the First and the Last.

14. Blessed [are] they who do His commandments, that their authority will be over the Tree of Life, and they may enter in by the gates into the city.

15. But outside [are] the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and makes a lie.

16. I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify these things to you over the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright and Morning Star.

17. And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let the [one] hearing say, Come! And let the one] who is thirsty come. And he willing, let him take of the water of life freely.

18. For I testify together [to] everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this Book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add on him the plagues that have been written in this Book.

19. And if anyone takes away from the words of the Book of this prophecy, God will take away his part out of the Book of Life, and out of the holy city, and [from] the things which have been written in this Book.

20. He who testifies these things says, Yes, I am coming quickly, Amen. Yes, come, Lord Jesus.

21. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with all of you. Amen.
