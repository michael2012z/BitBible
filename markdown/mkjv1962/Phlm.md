# Philemon

## Philemon 1

1. Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy [our] brother, to Philemon the beloved and fellow laborer,

2. and to Apphia the beloved, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house.

3. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

4. I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,

5. hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,

6. that the fellowship of your faith may operate in a full knowledge of every good thing in you in Christ Jesus.

7. For we have great joy and consolation over your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother.

8. Therefore, having much boldness in Christ to enjoin you to do the fitting thing;

9. rather through love I entreat, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

10. I entreat you for my child Onesimus, whom I have fathered in my bonds,

11. he who was] once worthless to you, but now useful to you and to me; whom I sent back to you.

12. Even receive him, that is, my own heart,

13. whom I resolved to retain with myself, so that for you he might have ministered to me in the bonds of the gospel.

14. But without your consent I was willing to do nothing, that your good should not be of necessity, but willingly.

15. For perhaps because of this he was separated from you for an hour, that you should receive him eternally,

16. not now as a slave, but beyond a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the] flesh and in the] Lord.

17. If then you have me as a partner, receive him as me.

18. If he has wronged you or owes [you] in anything, put that on my account.

19. I, Paul, wrote it] with my own] hand; I will repay, that I do not say to you that you owe even yourself to me also.

20. Yes, brother, that I may have your help in the Lord, refresh my heart in the Lord.

21. Trusting to your obedience, I wrote to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.

22. But at once prepare lodging for me, for I hope that through your prayers I shall be given to you.

23. Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,

24. and also Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-laborers.

25. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit. Amen.
