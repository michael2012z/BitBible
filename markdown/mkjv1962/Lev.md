# Leviticus

## Leviticus 1

1. And the LORD called to Moses and spoke to him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, If any one of you brings an offering to the LORD, you shall bring your offering of the cattle, of the herd and of the flock.

3. If his offering [is] a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish. He shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.

4. And he shall put his hand on the head of the burnt offering. And it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.

5. And he shall kill the young bull before the LORD. And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood and sprinkle the blood all around on the altar that [is by] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

6. And he shall skin the burnt offering and cut it into its pieces.

7. And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar and lay the wood in order on the fire.

8. And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall arrange the parts with the head and the fat on the wood that [is] on the fire on the altar.

9. But its inward parts and its legs he shall wash in water. And the priest shall burn all on the altar, a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.

10. And if his offering [is] of the flocks, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt offering, he shall bring a male without blemish.

11. And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD. And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle its blood all around on the altar.

12. And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat. And the priest shall arrange on the wood that [is] on the fire, which [is] on the altar.

13. But he shall wash the inward parts and the legs in water; and the priest shall bring near all [of it] and burn it on the altar. It [is] a burnt sacrifice, a fire offering of a sweet fragrance to the LORD.

14. And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD [is] out of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtle-doves or of young pigeons.

15. And the priest shall bring it to the altar, and wring off its head and burn [it] on the altar. And its blood shall be drained at the side of the altar.

16. And he shall pluck away its crop with its feathers, and throw it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes.

17. And he shall cut it in two with the wings of it, not dividing [it]. And the priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire. It [is] a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.

## Leviticus 2

1. And when anyone will offer a food offering to the LORD, his offering shall be [of] fine flour. And he shall pour oil on it and put frankincense on it.

2. And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons, the priests. And he shall take out of it his handful of flour and its oil, with all its frankincense. And the priest shall burn the memorial of it on the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.

3. And the rest of the food offering [shall be] Aaron's and his sons', most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.

6. You shall break it in pieces and pour oil on it. It [is] a food offering.

7. And if your offering [is] a food offering in the frying pan, it shall be made [of] fine flour with oil.

8. And you shall bring the food offering that is made of [these] things to the LORD. And when it is presented to the priest, he shall bring it to the altar.

9. And the priest shall take from the food offering a memorial of it, and shall burn [it] on the altar. It is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.

10. And that which is left of the food offering [shall be] Aaron's and his sons: [it is] most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.

11. Any food offering which you shall bring to the LORD shall not be made with leaven. For you shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire.

12. As an offering of the firstfruits, you shall bring them to the LORD. But they shall not be burned on the altar for a sweet savor.

13. And every sacrifice of your food offering shall you season with salt. And you shall not allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from your food offering. You shall offer salt with all your offerings.

14. And if you bring a food offering of your firstfruits to the LORD, green ears roasted by fire, kernels of a garden, you shall bring near for a food offering your firstfruits,

15. And you shall put oil on it and lay frankincense on it. It [is] a food offering.

16. And the priest shall burn it as incense with its memorial offering from its kernels and from its oil, besides all its frankincense, a fire offering to the LORD.

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying: If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD [concerning things] which ought not to be done, and shall do any one of them,

3. if the priest who is anointed sins, resulting in guilt to the people, then he shall bring for his sin, which he has sinned, a young bull, a son of the herd, a perfect one, to the LORD for a sin offering.

4. And he shall bring the young bull to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD, and [he] shall lay his hand on the young bull's head, and kill the young bull before the LORD.

5. And the priest who is anointed shall take of the young bull's blood, and shall bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation.

6. And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, at the front of the veil of the holy place.

7. And the priest shall put [some] of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which [is] in the tabernacle of the congregation. And he shall pour all the blood of the young bull at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

8. And he shall lift up from it all the fat of the young bull for the sin offering; the fat that covers the inward parts, and all the fat on the inward parts,

9. and the two kidneys, and the fat on them, beside the loins, and he shall remove the fold above the liver, with the kidneys.

10. Even as it was lifted from the young bull of the sacrifice of peace offerings, the priest shall burn them on the altar of the burnt offering.

11. And the skin of the young bull, and all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, and its inward parts, and its dung,

12. even the whole bull shall he carry forth outside the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on the wood with fire. It shall be burned where the ashes are poured out.

13. And if the whole company of Israel sins through ignorance, and the thing is hidden from the eyes of the assembly, and if they do that which ought not to be done to any of all the commands of the LORD, and are guilty;

14. when the sin is known which they have sinned against it, then the congregation shall bring near a young bull for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.

15. And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the young bull before the LORD, and the young bull shall be killed before the LORD.

16. And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the young bull's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation.

21. And he shall carry forth the young bull outside the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bull. It [is] a sin offering for the congregation.

22. When a ruler has sinned and through ignorance has acted against one of the commands of the LORD his God, which [is] not to be done, and is guilty;

23. or if his sin which he has sinned shall be made known to him, he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish.

24. And he shall lay his hand on the head of the goat and kill it in the place where he kills the burnt offering before the LORD. It [is] a sin offering.

27. And if any one of the people of the land sins through ignorance, by doing that which is not to be done against one of the commands of the LORD, and is guilty;

28. or if his sin which he has sinned shall be made known to him, then he shall bring his offering, a ewe of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he has sinned.

29. And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering, and kill the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.

And the priest shall burn them on the altar, on the fire offerings to the LORD. And the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he has sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.

## Leviticus 5

1. And if a soul sins and hears the voice of swearing, and [is] a witness, and he has seen or known, if he does not tell it, then he shall bear his iniquity.

2. Or if a soul touches any unclean thing, whether a dead body of an unclean beast, or a dead body of unclean cattle, or the dead body of unclean swarming things, and [if] it is hidden from him that he is unclean and guilty--

3. or if he touches the uncleanness of man, whatever uncleanness by which he is unclean, and it is hidden from him, and he knows, then he shall be guilty.

4. Or if a soul swears, pronouncing with [his] lips to do evil or to do good, whatever it is that a man speaks rashly with an oath, and it is hidden from him, and he knows, then he shall be guilty of one of these.

5. And it shall be when he is guilty in one of these, he shall confess that in which he has sinned.

6. And he shall bring his trespass offering to the LORD for his sin which he has sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a doe of the goats, for a sin offering. And the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin.

7. And if his hand cannot reach to a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass which he has committed, two turtle-doves or two young pigeons to the LORD-- one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering.

8. And he shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer for the sin offering first, and shall wring off its head from its neck, but shall not divide [it].

9. And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, and the rest of the blood shall be drained at the bottom of the altar. It [is] a sin offering.

10. And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the ordinance. And the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he has sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.

11. But if he is not able to bring two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering. He shall put no oil on it, neither shall he put frankincense on it. For it [is] a sin offering.

12. And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his full handful of it, a memorial of it, and burn [it] on the altar, on the fire offering to the LORD. It is a sin offering.

13. And the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin that he has sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him. And [the rest] shall be the priest's, as a food offering.

14. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

15. If a soul commits a trespass and sins through ignorance in the holy things of the LORD, then he shall bring for his trespass to the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flock, together with an amount set by you, by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.

16. And he shall make it good [in] which he has sinned, in the holy thing, and he shall add the fifth part of it, and give it to the priest. And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.

17. And if a soul sins, and he has done that which ought not to be done, any one from all the commands of the LORD, and does not know, and he is guilty and bears his iniquity;

18. then he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, at your evaluation, for a trespass offering, to the priest. And the priest shall make an atonement for him for his ignorance in which he erred without knowing it, and it shall be forgiven him.

19. It [is] a trespass offering. He has certainly trespassed against the LORD.

## Leviticus 6

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. If a soul sins, and acts unfaithfully against the LORD, and lies to his neighbor as to a deposit-- or as to security, or by robbery, or has extorted his neighbor,

3. or has found that which was lost and lies concerning it and swears falsely-- in any of all [these] that a man does, sinning in it,

4. then, it shall be, because he sinned and is guilty, he shall pay back that which he got by robbery; or if he robbed the thing extorted; or the deposit which had been deposited with him; or the lost thing which he had found;

5. or all that which he swore about falsely, --he shall even repay it in its principal, and the fifth part he shall add to it, to whomever it belongs. He shall give it on the day of his guilt offering.

6. And he shall bring his trespass offering to the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, together with an amount set by you, for a trespass offering, to the priest.

7. And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD, and it shall be forgiven him for anything of all that he has done by being guilty in it.

8. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

9. Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This [is] the law of the burnt offering. It is the burnt offering for burning on the altar all night to the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.

10. And the priest shall put on his linen garment. And he shall put his linen breeches on his flesh and take up the ashes which the fire has consumed with the burnt offering on the altar. And he shall put them beside the altar.

11. And he shall strip off his garments and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.

12. And the fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it. It shall not be put out. And the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order on it. And he shall burn on it the fat of the peace offerings.

13. The fire shall always be burning on the altar. It shall never go out.

14. And this [is] the law of the food offering. The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD before the altar.

15. And he shall take from it his handful of the flour of the food offering, and of the oil of it, and all the frankincense which is on the food offering, and shall burn [it] on the altar for a sweet savor, the memorial of it, to the LORD.

16. And the rest of it Aaron and his sons shall eat. It shall be eaten [with] unleavened bread in the holy place. They shall eat it in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.

17. It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it [as] their portion of My offerings made by fire. It [is] most holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering is.

18. All the males among the sons of Aaron shall eat of it. [It shall be] a statute forever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire. Everyone that touches them shall be holy.

19. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

20. This [is] the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the LORD in the day [he is] anointed, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a continual food offering, half of it in the morning and half of it at night.

21. It shall be made in a pan with oil; you shall bring it in. And you shall offer the baked pieces of the food offering, a sweet savor to the LORD.

22. And the priest of his sons, who is anointed in his stead, shall offer it. [It is] a statute forever to the LORD. It shall be wholly burnt.

23. For every food offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt. It shall not be eaten.

24. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

25. Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This [is] the law of the sin offering. In the place where the burnt offering is killed, the sin offering shall be killed before the LORD. It [is] most holy.

26. The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. It shall be eaten in the holy place, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.

27. Whatever shall touch its flesh shall be holy. And when any of its blood is sprinkled on any garment, you shall wash that on which it was sprinkled in the holy place.

28. But the earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken. And if it is boiled in a bronze pot, it shall be both scoured and rinsed in water.

29. All the males among the priests shall eat of it. It [is] most holy.

30. And no sin offering, of which [any] of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation for atonement in the sanctuary, shall be eaten. It shall be burned up in the fire.

## Leviticus 7

1. And this [is] the law of the trespass offering. It is most holy.

2. In the place where they kill the burnt offering, they shall kill the trespass offering. And he shall sprinkle its blood on the altar all around.

3. And he shall offer all its fat; he shall offer the fat tail of it, and the fat that covers the inward parts,

4. and the two kidneys, and the fat on them, on the loins, and the fold above the liver, beside the kidneys, he shall take away.

5. And the priest shall burn them on the altar for a fire offering to the LORD. It is a trespass offering.

6. Every male among the priests shall eat of it. It shall be eaten in the holy place. It [is] most holy.

7. As the sin offering, so [is] the trespass offering. There is one law for them. The priest that makes atonement with it, it is his.

8. And the priest that offers any man's burnt offering, that priest shall have the skin of the burnt offering which he has offered; it is his.

9. And all the food offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed in the frying-pan and on the griddle, shall be the priest's that offers it; it is his.

10. And every food offering mixed with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one like another.

11. And this [is] the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings which he shall offer to the LORD.

12. If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mixed with oil, of fine flour, fried.

13. Besides the cakes, he shall offer [for] his offering unleavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.

14. And from it he shall offer one cake out of the whole sacrifice for a heave offering to the LORD, to the priest that sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings; it is his.

15. And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered. He shall not leave any of it until the morning.

16. But if the sacrifice of his offering [is] a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offers his sacrifice. And on the next day also the rest of it shall be eaten.

17. But the rest of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned with fire.

18. And if [any] of the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace offerings is eaten at all the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed to him who offers it. It shall be an abomination, and the soul that eats of it shall bear his iniquity.

19. And the flesh that touches any unclean [thing] shall not be eaten. It shall be burned with fire. And as for the flesh, all who are clean shall eat of it.

20. But the soul that eats [of] the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings that pertain to the LORD, having his uncleanness on him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.

21. And the soul that shall touch any unclean [thing], of the uncleanness of man, or any unclean animal, or an unclean abominable thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings which pertain to the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.

22. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

23. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, You shall not eat any fat of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.

24. And the fat of a dead body, and the fat of a thing torn, may be used in any other use. But you shall in no way eat it.

25. For whoever eats the fat of the beast of which men offer an offering made by fire to the LORD, even the soul that eats [it] shall be cut off from his people.

26. And you shall not eat any blood, of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.

27. Any soul who eats any blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.

28. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

29. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, He who offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to the LORD, shall bring his sacrifice to the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.

30. His own hands shall bring in the fire offerings of the LORD. He shall bring the fat with the breast, so that the breast may be waved [for] a wave-offering before the LORD.

31. And the priest shall burn the fat on the altar. But the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.

32. And you shall give the right shoulder to the priest [for] a heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.

33. He among the sons of Aaron who offers the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for [his] part.

34. For I have taken the wave breast and the heave shoulder from the sons of Israel, from the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons by a statute forever from among the sons of Israel.

35. This is the [portion] of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day he presented them to minister to the LORD in the priest's office,

36. which the LORD commanded to be given to them of the sons of Israel, in the day that He anointed them as a statute forever throughout their generations.

37. This [is] the law of the burnt offering, of the food offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifices of the peace offerings,

38. which the LORD commanded Moses in Mount Sinai, in the day that He commanded the sons of Israel to offer their sacrifices to the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.

22. And he brought the second ram, the ram of consecration. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.

23. And he killed [it]. And Moses took of the blood of it, and put [it] on the tip of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.

24. And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put the blood on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the great toes of their right feet. And Moses sprinkled the blood on the altar all around.

25. And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat on the inward parts, and the fold [above] the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder.

26. And he took one unleavened cake out of the basket of unleavened bread that [was] before the LORD, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put [them] on the fat, and on the right shoulder.

27. And he put all on Aaron's hands, and on his sons' hands, and waved them [for] a wave offering before the LORD.

28. And Moses took them off their hands and burned them on the altar on the burnt offering. They [were] consecrations for a sweet savor. It [is] a fire offering to the LORD.

29. And Moses took the breast and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD. It was Moses' part of the ram of consecration, even as the LORD commanded Moses.

30. And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which [was] on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, [and] on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons' garments with him. And he sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.

31. And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. And eat it there with the bread in the basket of consecrations, as I have commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.

32. And that which remains of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn with fire.

33. You shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation seven days, until the days of your consecration are at an end. For He shall consecrate you seven days.

34. As He has done this day, the LORD has commanded you to do, to make an atonement for you.

35. And you shall remain [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, so that you do not die. For so I am commanded.

36. And Aaron and his sons did all the things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.

## Leviticus 9

1. And it happened on the eighth day. Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel.

2. And he said to Aaron, Take a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram without blemish for a burnt offering, and offer before the LORD.

3. And speak to the sons of Israel, saying, Take a kid of the goats for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb of the first year, all without blemish, for a burnt offering.

4. Also take a young bull and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD, and a food offering mixed with oil. For today the LORD will appear to you.

5. And they brought [that] which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation. And all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.

6. And Moses said, This [is] the thing which the LORD commanded that you should do. And the glory of the LORD shall appear to you.

7. And Moses said to Aaron, Go to the altar, and offer your sin offering and your burnt offerings, and make an atonement for yourself and for the people. And offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them, even as the LORD commanded.

8. Aaron then went to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering, which [was] for himself.

9. And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him. And he dipped his finger in the blood and put [it] on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar.

10. But he burned the fat and the kidneys and the fold above the liver of the sin offering on the altar, even as the LORD commanded Moses.

11. And he burned the flesh and the hide with fire outside the camp.

12. And he killed the burnt offering. And Aaron's sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled all around on the altar.

13. And they presented the burnt offering to him, with the pieces of it, and the head. And he burned [them] on the altar.

14. And he washed the inward parts and the legs, and burned [them] on the burnt offering on the altar.

15. And he brought the people's offering. And he took the goat, the sin offering for the people, and killed it and offered it for sin as the first.

16. And he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance.

17. And he brought the food offering and took a handful of it, and burned [it] on the altar besides the burnt sacrifice of the morning.

18. He also killed the young bull and the ram [for] a sacrifice of peace offerings for the people. And Aaron's sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled on the altar all around.

19. And they brought the fat of the young bull and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers the inward parts, and the kidneys, and the fold [above] the liver.

20. And they put the fat on the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar.

21. And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved [for] a wave offering before the Lord, as Moses commanded.

22. And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and peace offerings.

23. And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out and blessed the people. And the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.

24. And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and burned up the burnt offering and the fat on the altar. And all the people saw and shouted and fell on their faces.

## Leviticus 10

1. And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer and put fire in it, and put incense on it, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which He had not commanded them.

2. And there went out fire from the LORD and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.

3. Then Moses said to Aaron, It [is] that which the LORD spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come near me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.

4. And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel, the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Come near, carry your brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp.

5. And they came near and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.

6. And Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar his sons, Do not uncover your heads nor tear your clothes, lest you die, and lest He be angry on all the people. But let your brothers, the whole of Israel, mourn the burning which the LORD has kindled.

7. And you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest you die. For the anointing oil of the LORD [is] on you. And they did according to the word of Moses.

8. And the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying,

9. Do not drink wine nor strong drink, neither you nor your sons with you, when you go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest you die, a statute forever throughout your generations.

10. Even for a distinction between the holy and unholy, and between the unclean and clean

11. and so that you may teach the sons of Israel all the statutes which the LORD has spoken to them by the hand of Moses.

12. And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the food offering that remains of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar. For it [is] most holy.

13. And you shall eat in the holy place, because it [is] your due, and your sons' due, of the fire offerings of the LORD made by fire. For so I am commanded.

14. And the wave breast and heave shoulder you shall eat in a clean place, you, and your sons and your daughters with you. For [they have been] given for your portion and the portion of your sons out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the sons of Israel.

15. The heave shoulder and the wave breast they shall bring with the fire offerings of the fat, to wave [for] a wave offering before the LORD. And it shall be yours, and your sons' with you, by a statute forever, even as the LORD has commanded.

16. And Moses carefully looked for the goat of the sin offering. And behold, it was burned! And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron left alive, saying,

17. Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, since it [is] most holy, and He has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?

18. Behold! The blood of it was not brought within the holy place! You should indeed have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.

19. And Aaron said to Moses, Behold, this day they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD. And such things have happened to me. And [if] I had eaten the sin offering today, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?

20. And Moses heard, and it was good in his eyes.

## Leviticus 11

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, These [are] the animals which you shall eat among all the animals that are in the earth.

3. Whatever divides the hoof, and is cloven-footed, [chewing] the cud, among the animals, that you shall eat.

4. Only, you shall not eat these of them that [chew] the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: the camel, for he [chews] the cud but does not divide the hoof; he [is] unclean to you.

5. And the rock badger, because he [chews] the cud, but does not divide the hoof; he [is] unclean to you.

6. And the hare, because he [chews] the cud but does not divide [the] hoof; he [is] unclean to you.

7. And the swine, though he divides the hoof and is cloven-footed, yet he does not [chew] the cud; he [is] unclean to you.

8. You shall not eat of their flesh, and you shall not touch their dead body. They [are] unclean to you.

9. These you shall eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them you shall eat.

10. And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing that [is] in the waters, they shall be an abomination to you.

11. They shall even be an abomination to you. You shall not eat of their flesh, but you shall have their carcasses in abomination.

12. Whatever has no fins nor scales in the waters [shall be] an abomination to you.

13. And you shall have these in abomination among the fowls. They shall not be eaten, they [are] an abomination: the eagle, and the black vulture, and the bearded vulture,

14. and the kite, and the falcon, according to its kind;

15. every raven according to its kind;

16. and the ostrich, and the great owl, and the gull, and small hawks, according to its kind,

17. and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the eared owl;

18. and the barn owl, and the pelican, and the owl-vulture;

19. and the stork, the heron according to its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.

20. Every flying swarming creature going on all four, it [is] an abomination to you.

21. Yet you may eat these of any flying swarming thing that goes on [all] four, those which have legs above their feet, to leap with on the earth.

22. You may eat these of them: the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the long horned locust after its kind, and the short horned grasshopper after its kind.

23. But every [other] flying swarming thing which [has] four feet shall be an abomination to you.

24. And you shall be unclean for these. Whoever touches their dead body shall be unclean until the evening.

25. And whoever carries the carcass of them shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening;

26. even every living thing which divides the hoof, and is not cloven-footed, nor [chews] the cud, they [are] unclean to you. Everyone that touches them shall be unclean.

27. And whatever goes on its paws, among all the living things that go on [all] four, those are unclean to you. Whoever touches their dead body shall be unclean until the evening.

28. And he that carries their dead bodies shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening. They [are] unclean to you.

29. These also [shall be] unclean to you among the swarming things that swarm on the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kind;

30. and the gecko, and the monitor, and the lizard, and the sand lizard, and chameleon.

31. These [are] unclean to you among all that swarm. Whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until the evening.

32. And whatever shall fall on [any] of them when they are dead, [shall be] unclean, [whether] any vessel of wood, or clothing, or skin, or sack; whatever vessel in which work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean to the evening. So it shall be cleaned.

33. And every earthen vessel in which [any] of them falls, whatever [is] in it shall be unclean. And you shall break it.

34. Of all food which may be eaten, [that] on which such water comes shall be unclean. And all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean.

35. And every [thing] on which [any part] of their dead body falls shall be unclean; [whether it is] the oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down. They [are] unclean, and shall be unclean to you.

36. But a fountain or pit, [with] a collection of water, shall be clean. But that which touches their dead body shall be unclean.

37. And if [any] of their dead body falls on any sowing seed which is to be sown, it shall be clean.

38. But if [any] water is put on the seed, and any part of the dead body falls on it, it [shall be] unclean to you.

39. And if any animal among those you may eat dies, he that touches its dead body shall be unclean until the evening.

40. And he that eats of its dead body shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening. He also that carries its body shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.

41. And every swarming thing that swarms on the earth [shall be] an abomination. It shall not be eaten.

42. Anything going on its belly, and any going on [all] four, and all having many feet, even every swarming thing that swarms on the earth, you shall not eat them. For they are an abomination.

43. You shall not defile yourselves with any swarming thing that swarms, neither shall you make yourselves unclean with them, so that you should be defiled by them.

44. For I [am] the LORD your God, and you shall sanctify yourselves, and you shall be holy, for I [am] holy. Neither shall you defile yourselves with any kind of swarming thing that swarms on the earth.

45. For I [am] the LORD who brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. You shall therefore be holy, for I [am] holy.

46. This [is] the law of the animals, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moves in the waters, and of every creature that swarms on the earth,

47. to make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the creature that may be eaten and the creature that may not be eaten.

## Leviticus 12

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, If a woman has conceived seed and has borne a male, then she shall be unclean seven days; as on the days of her menstrual impurity she shall be unclean.

3. And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.

4. And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying thirty-three days. She shall touch no holy thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying are fulfilled.

5. But if she bears a female, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her menstruation. And she shall continue in the blood of her purifying sixty-six days.

6. And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtle-dove, for a sin offering to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to the priest.

7. And he shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her. And she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This [is] the law for her that has borne a male or a female.

8. And if her hand cannot reach to a lamb, then she shall bring two turtle-doves or two young pigeons. The one shall be for a burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering. And the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be cleansed.

## Leviticus 13

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

2. When a man has a rising in the skin of his flesh, or a scab or bright spot, and it is in the skin of his flesh [like] the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests.

3. And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh. And [if] the hair in the plague has turned white, and the plague in sight [is] deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy. And the priest shall look on him and shall pronounce him unclean.

4. And if the bright spot [is] white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight is not deeper than the skin, and the hair of it has not turned white, then the priest shall shut up the plague seven days.

5. And the priest shall look on him the seventh day. And behold, [if] the plague in his sight is stayed; the plague has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days more.

6. And the priest shall look on him again in the seventh day. And, behold, [if] the plague [is] somewhat dark; the plague has not spread in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean. It [is] a scab. And he shall wash his clothes and be clean.

7. But if the scab spreads greatly in the skin after he has been seen by the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen by the priest again.

8. And [if] the priest sees that, behold, the scab spreads in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It [is] a leprosy.

9. When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest.

10. And the priest shall look. And, behold, if the rising is white in the skin, and it has turned the hair white and [there is] live raw flesh in the rising,

11. it [is] an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh. And the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.

12. And if a leprosy breaks out greatly on the skin, and the leprosy covers all the skin of the [one who has] the plague from his head even to his foot, to all that appears to the eyes of the priest,

13. then the priest shall look. And behold, [if] the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce the plagued one clean. It has all turned white. He is clean.

14. But when raw flesh appears in him, he shall be unclean.

15. And the priest shall look on the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean. The raw flesh [is] unclean; it [is] a leprosy.

16. Or if the raw flesh turns again and is changed to white, he shall come to the priest.

17. And the priest shall look on him. And, behold, the plague has turned to white, then the priest shall pronounce the plagued one clean. He [is] clean.

18. And when the flesh has a boil in his skin, and it has healed,

19. and in the place of the boil there is a white rising or a bright spot, a reddish white, it shall be shown to the priest;

20. and if the priest sees it, and behold, it [is] in sight lower than the skin, and the hair of it has turned white, the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It [is] a plague of leprosy broken out in a boil.

21. But if the priest looks on it, and, behold, [there are] no white hairs in it, and it [is] not lower than the skin, but has become dark, then the priest shall shut him up seven days.

22. And if it spreads greatly in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It [is] a plague.

23. But if the bright spot stays in its place, not spreading, it [is] a burning boil. And the priest shall pronounce him clean.

24. Or if there is flesh in which the skin has a hot burning, and the raw [flesh] of the burning [becomes] a white bright spot, reddish or white,

25. then the priest shall look on it. And behold, the hair in the bright spot has turned white, and [it is] in sight deeper than the skin, it [is] leprosy broken out of the burning. Therefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It [is] the plague of leprosy.

26. But if the priest looks on it, and behold, there [is] no white hair in the bright spot, and it [is] no lower than the [other] skin, but is somewhat dark, then the priest shall shut him up seven days.

27. And the priest shall look on him the seventh day. If it spreads farther in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It [is] the plague of leprosy.

28. And if the bright spot stays in its place, and does not spread in the skin, but [is] somewhat faded, it [is] a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it [is] a scar of the burning.

29. If a man or woman has in them a plague on the head or the beard,

30. then the priest shall see the plague. And behold, if it [is] in sight deeper than the skin, and a yellow thin hair [is] in it, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It [is] a dry scab, a leprosy on the head or beard.

31. And if the priest looks on the plague of the scab, and behold, it [is] not in sight deeper than the skin, and no black hair [is] in it, then the priest shall shut up the plagued one [with] the scab seven days.

32. And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague. And behold, [if] the scab does not spread, and no yellow hair [is] in it, and the scab [is] not in sight deeper than the skin,

33. he shall be shaven, but shall not shave the scab. And the priest shall shut up [the one who has] the scab seven days more.

34. And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scab. And behold, [if] the scab has not spread in the skin, nor [is] in sight deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. And he shall wash his clothes and be clean.

35. But if the scab spreads very much in the skin after his cleansing,

36. then the priest shall look on him, and behold, if the scab is spread in the skin, the priest shall not look for shining yellow hair. He [is] unclean.

37. But if in his eyes the scab is stabilized, and black hair is growing up in it, the scab is healed. He [is] clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

38. Also if a man or a woman has bright spots in the skin of their flesh, white bright spots,

39. then the priest shall look. And behold, [if] pale white bright spots [are] in the skin of their flesh, it [is] a pale spot springing up in the skin. He [is] clean.

40. And when a man's head grows bald; he [is] bald. He [is] clean.

41. And if his head grows bald from the edge of his face, he [is] forehead bald. He [is] clean.

42. And if there is in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore, it [is] a leprosy sprung up in his bald head or his bald forehead.

43. And the priest shall look on it. And behold, [if] the rising of the sore is reddish white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appears in the skin of the flesh,

44. he [is] a man with leprosy. He [is] unclean. The priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean. His plague [is] in his head.

45. And as for the leper in whom the plague [is], his clothes shall be torn, and his head shall be bare, and he shall put a covering on his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean! Unclean!

46. All the days in which the plague [is] in him he shall be defiled. He is unclean. He shall live alone. His dwelling [shall be] outside the camp.

47. And if there is any garment that has the plague of leprosy in it, in a wool garment or a linen garment,

48. or in the warp or in the woof, of linen or of wool, or in a skin or in anything of skin,

49. and if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it [is] a plague of leprosy. And it shall be shown to the priest.

50. And the priest shall look on the plague, and shut up [that which has] the plague seven days.

51. And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day. If the plague is spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in any skin [or] in any work that is made of skin, the plague  is] a fretting leprosy. It [is unclean.

52. And he shall burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in wool or in linen, or anything of skin in which the plague is. For it [is] a fretting leprosy. It shall be burned in the fire.

53. And if the priest shall look, and behold, the plague has not spread in the garment, either in the warp or the woof, or anything of skin,

54. then the priest shall command that they wash [the thing] in which the plague is. And he shall shut it up seven days more.

55. And the priest shall look on the plague after it is washed, and behold, [if] the plague has not changed its color and the plague has not spread; it [is] unclean. You shall burn it in the fire. It [is] eaten away in its inside or in its outside.

56. And if the priest looks, and behold, the plague [is] somewhat dark after the washing of it, then he shall tear it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof.

57. And if it appears still in the garment, or in the warp or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it [is] a spreading [plague]. You shall burn that which [is] in it [is] the plague [is] with fire.

58. And the garment which you shall wash, either warp or woof, or whatever thing of skin it is, if the plague has departed from them, then it shall be washed a second time, and shall be clean.

59. This [is] the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woolen or linen, either in the warp or woof or anything of skins, to pronounce it clean or to pronounce it unclean.

## Leviticus 14

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing. He shall be brought to the priest.

3. And the priest shall go forth out of the camp. And the priest shall look, and behold, [if] the plague of leprosy is healed in the leper,

4. then the priest shall command to take two clean live birds for him that is to be cleansed, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.

5. And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water.

6. He shall take the living bird, and the cedar wood and the scarlet and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the slain bird, over the running water.

7. And he shall sprinkle on him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.

8. And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water so that he may be clean. And after that he shall come into the camp, and shall stay outside his tent seven days.

9. But on the seventh day he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eye-brows; even all his hair shall he shave off. And he shall wash his clothes. He also shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.

10. And on the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three-tenth parts of fine flour [for] a food offering, mixed with oil, and one log of oil.

11. And the priest who is cleansing, and the man who is to be cleansed, shall stand with them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

12. And the priest shall take one male lamb and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them [for] a wave offering before the LORD.

13. And he shall kill the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place. For as the sin offering [is] the priest's, so is the trespass offering. It [is] most holy.

14. And the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it on the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.

15. And the priest shall take from the log of oil and pour into the palm of his own left hand.

16. And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil in his left hand and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD.

17. And of the rest of the oil in his hand, the priest shall put on the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on the blood of the trespass offering.

18. And the rest of the oil in the priest's palm he shall pour on the head of him that is to be cleansed. And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD.

19. And the priest shall offer the sin offering and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness. And afterward he shall kill the burnt offering.

20. And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the food offering on the altar. And the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.

21. And if he [is] poor and his hand cannot reach [so much], then he shall take one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one-tenth part of fine flour mixed with oil for a food offering, and a log of oil,

22. and two turtle-doves or two young pigeons, such as his hand can reach. And the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering.

23. And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.

24. And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them [for] a wave offering before the LORD.

25. And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering. And the priest shall take from the blood of the trespass offering, and put it on the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.

26. And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand.

27. And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD.

28. And the priest shall put of the oil in his hand on the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on the place of the blood of the trespass offering.

29. And the rest of the oil in the priest's hand he shall put on the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the LORD.

30. And he shall offer the one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons, such as he is able to get,

31. even such as he is able to reach, the one [for] a sin offering and the other [for] a burnt offering, with the food offering. And the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD.

32. This [is] the law of him in whom [is] the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to reach in his cleansing.

33. And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

34. When you come into the land of Canaan which I give you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house in the land of your possession,

35. and if he that owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, A plague [is] seen by me in the house;

36. then the priest shall command that they empty the house before the priest goes to see the plague, so that all that [is] in the house may not become unclean. And afterwards the priest shall go in to see the house.

37. And he shall look on the plague. And behold, [if] the plague [is] in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall,

38. then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.

39. And the priest shall come again the seventh day and shall look. And behold, [if] the plague has spread in the walls of the house,

40. then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague [is], and they shall throw them into an unclean place outside the city.

41. And he shall cause the house to be scraped inside all around, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off outside the city in an unclean place.

42. And they shall take other stones and put [them] in the place of those stones. And he shall take other mortar and shall plaster the house.

43. And if the plague comes again and breaks out in the house after he has taken away the stones and after he has scraped the house, and after it is plastered,

44. then the priest shall come and look. And behold, [if] the plague has spread in the house, it [is] a fretting leprosy in the house. It [is] unclean.

45. And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber of it, and all the mortar of the house, and he shall carry [them] out of the city into an unclean place.

46. And he that goes into the house all the days that it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening.

47. And he that lies in the house shall wash his clothes. And he that eats in the house shall wash his clothes.

48. And if the priest shall come in and look, and, behold, the plague has not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean because the plague is healed.

49. And he shall take two birds to cleanse the house, and cedar-wood, and scarlet [dye], and hyssop.

50. And he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.

51. And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet dye, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times.

52. And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet.

53. But he shall let the living bird go out of the city into the open field, and make an atonement for the house. And it shall be clean.

54. This [is] the law for all kinds of plague of leprosy and scab,

55. and for the leprosy of a garment and of a house,

56. and for a rising and for a scab and for a bright spot,

57. to teach when [it is] unclean and when it is clean. This [is] the law of leprosy.

## Leviticus 15

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When any man has a discharge from his flesh; he is unclean [because of] his discharge.

3. And this shall be his uncleanness in his discharge. His flesh has run with his discharge, or his flesh [is] ceased from his discharge, it [is] his uncleanness.

4. Every bed on which he who discharges lies is unclean. And everything on which he sits shall be unclean.

5. And whoever touches his bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.

6. And he that sits on [any] thing on which he who discharges sat shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.

7. And he that touches the flesh of him who discharges shall wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.

8. And if he who discharges spits on him that is clean, then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.

9. And whatever saddle he who discharges rides on shall be unclean.

10. And whoever touches anything that was under him shall be unclean until the evening. And he that carries [any of] those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.

11. And whomever he who discharges touches, and has not rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.

12. And the earthen vessel that he who discharges touches shall be broken. And every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.

13. And when he who discharges is cleansed of his discharge, then he shall number seven days to himself for his cleansing, and wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.

14. And on the eighth day he shall take two turtle-doves to himself, or two young pigeons, and come before the LORD to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and give them to the priest.

15. And the priest shall offer them, the one [for] a sin offering and the other [for] a burnt offering. And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD for his discharge.

16. And if any man's semen goes from him, then he shall wash all his flesh in water and be unclean until the evening.

17. And every garment and every skin on which the semen shall be, it shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the evening.

18. And the woman with whom a man shall lie [with] emission of semen shall both bathe in water and be unclean until the evening.

19. And if a woman has a discharge, [and] her discharge in her flesh is blood, she shall be in her impurity seven days. And whoever touches her shall be unclean until the evening.

20. And everything that she lies on in her impurity shall be unclean. Everything also that she sits on shall be unclean.

21. And whoever touches her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.

22. And whoever touches anything that she sat on, shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.

23. And if it [is] on the bed or on anything on which she sits, when he touches it, he shall be unclean until the evening.

24. And if any man lies with her at all, and her impurity is on him, he shall be unclean seven days. And every bed on which he lies shall be unclean.

25. And if a woman has a discharge of her blood many days outside of the time of her impurity, or if she discharges it beyond the time of her impurity, all the days of the discharge of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her impurity. She  is] unclean.

26. Every bed on which she lies all the days of her discharge shall be to her as the bed of her impurity. And whatever she sits on shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her impurity.

27. And whoever touches those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.

28. But if she is cleansed of her discharge, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.

29. And on the eighth day she shall take two turtle-doves to her, or two young pigeons, and bring them to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

30. And the priest shall offer the one [for] a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering. And the priest shall make atonement for her before the LORD for the discharge of her uncleanness.

31. So you shall separate the sons of Israel from their uncleanness, so that they do not die in their uncleanness when they defile My tabernacle that [is] among them.

32. This [is] the law of him that has an discharge, and of him whose semen goes from him and is defiled with it,

33. and of her that is menstruating, and of him that has an discharge, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lies with an unclean woman.

## Leviticus 16

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD and they died.

2. and the LORD said to Moses, Speak to Aaron your brother, that he does not come at all times into the sanctuary within the veil before the mercy-seat, which is on the Ark, so that he will not die. For I will appear in the cloud on the mercy-seat.

3. Aaron shall come into the sanctuary this way: with a bull, a son of the herd, for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.

4. He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches on his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen miter he shall be dressed. [These are] holy garments. And he shall wash his flesh in water and put them on.

5. And he shall take from the congregation of the sons of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.

6. And Aaron shall offer his young bull of the sin offering which is for himself, and make an atonement for himself and for his house.

7. And he shall take the two goats and present them before the LORD [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

8. And Aaron shall cast lots on the two goats; one lot for the LORD and the other lot for the scapegoat.

9. And Aaron shall bring the goat on which the LORD's lot fell, and offer it for a sin offering.

10. But the goat on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.

11. And Aaron shall bring the young bull of the sin offering which is for himself, and shall atone for himself and for his house, and shall kill the young bull of the sin offering which is for himself.

12. And he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before Jehovah, and his hands full of fragrant perfumes beaten small, and bring [it] within the veil.

13. And he shall put the incense on the fire before the LORD. And the cloud of the incense shall cover the mercy-seat that is on the Testimony. And he shall not die.

14. And he shall take of the blood of the young bull and shall sprinkle with his finger on the front of the mercy-seat eastward. And he shall sprinkle at the front of the mercy-seat seven times from the blood with his finger.

15. Then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering that is for the people, and bring its blood inside the veil. And he shall do with that blood as he did with the blood of the young bull, and sprinkle it on the mercy-seat and before the mercy-seat.

16. And he shall atone for the sanctuary, because of the uncleannesses of the sons of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins. And so he shall do for the tabernacle of the congregation which remains with them in the midst of their uncleannesses.

17. And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goes in to make an atonement in the sanctuary, until he comes out and has made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel.

18. And he shall go out to the altar that [is] before the LORD and make an atonement for it. And he shall take of the blood of the young bull, and of the blood of the goat, and put [it] on the horns of the altar all around.

19. And he shall sprinkle of the blood on it with his finger seven times and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the sons of Israel.

20. And when he has made an end of reconciling the sanctuary and the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, he shall bring the live goat.

21. And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the sins of the sons of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them on the head of the goat, and shall send away by the hand of a chosen man into the wilderness.

22. And the goat shall bear on him all their sins to a land in which no one lives. And he shall let the goat go in the wilderness.

23. And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall strip off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the sanctuary, and shall leave them there.

24. And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself and for the people.

25. And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn on the altar.

26. And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp.

27. And the young bull [for] the sin offering, and the goat [for] the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy [place], shall they carry forth outside the camp. And they shall burn their skins in the fire, and their flesh and their dung.

28. And he who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.

29. And it shall be a statute forever to you: in the seventh month, on the tenth of the month, you shall afflict your souls and do no work at all, the native and the alien who is staying among you.

30. For on that day an atonement shall be made for you, to cleanse you, so that you may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.

31. It [shall be] a sabbath of rest to you, and you shall afflict your souls, by a statute forever.

32. And the priest whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead, shall make the atonement and shall put on the linen clothes, the holy garments.

33. And he shall make an atonement [for] the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar; and he shall make an atonement for the priests and for all the people of the congregation.

34. And this shall be an everlasting statute to you, to make an atonement for the sons of Israel for their sins once a year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.

## Leviticus 17

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

2. Speak to Aaron and to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel, and say to them, This [is] the thing which the LORD has commanded, saying,

3. Any man of the house of Israel who kills an ox or lamb or goat in the camp, or kills it out of the camp,

4. and does not bring it to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer as offering to the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD, blood shall be charged to that man; he has shed blood. And that man shall be cut off from among his people,

5. so that the sons of Israel may bring their sacrifices which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them to the LORD, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to the priest, and offer them [for] peace offerings to the LORD.

6. And the priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of the LORD [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savor to the LORD.

7. And they shall no more offer their sacrifices to goats, after whom they have gone whoring. This shall be a statute forever to them throughout their generations.

8. And you shall say to them, Any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who are staying among you, offers a burnt offering or sacrifice,

9. and does not bring it to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation to offer it to the LORD, even that man shall be cut off from among his people.

10. And any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that are staying among you, who eats any blood, I will set My face against that soul who eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people.

11. For the life of the flesh [is] in the blood. And I have given it to you on the altar to make an atonement for your souls. For it [is] the blood that makes an atonement for the soul.

12. Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that is staying among you eat blood.

13. And any man of the sons of Israel, or of the strangers that are staying among you, who hunts game, beast or fowl, that may be eaten, he shall even pour out its blood and cover it with dust.

14. For [it is] the life of all flesh. Its blood is for the life of it. Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, You shall not eat the blood of any flesh. For the life of all flesh is its blood. Whoever eats it shall be cut off.

15. And any soul that eats a dead body, or a torn thing, whether a native or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening. Then he shall be clean.

16. But if he does not wash, nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity.

## Leviticus 18

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, I [am] the LORD your God.

3. You shall not do like the doings of the land of Egypt in which you lived. And you shall not do like the doings of the land of Canaan, where I bring you. Neither shall you walk in their ordinances.

4. You shall do My judgments and keep My ordinances, to walk in them. I [am] the LORD your God.

5. And you shall keep My statutes and My judgments, which if a man does, he shall live in them. I [am] the LORD.

6. None of you shall approach to any who are near of kin to him, to uncover [their] nakedness. I [am] the LORD.

7. You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father or the nakedness of your mother. She [is] your mother; you shall not uncover her nakedness.

8. You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's wife. It [is] your father's nakedness.

9. You shall not uncover the nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father or the daughter of your mother, born at home or born away. Their nakedness you shall not uncover.

10. The nakedness of your son's daughter, or of your daughter's daughter, you shall not uncover their nakedness. For theirs [is] your own nakedness.

11. You shall not uncover the nakedness of the daughter of your father's wife, begotten of your father. She [is] your sister.

12. You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's sister. She [is] your father's near kinswoman.

13. You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister. For she [is] your mother's near kinswoman.

14. You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's brother. You shall not approach his wife. She [is] your aunt.

15. You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law. She [is] your son's wife. You shall not uncover her nakedness.

16. You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother's wife. It [is] your brother's nakedness.

17. You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shall you undertake to uncover her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter. They [are] her near kinswomen; it [is] wickedness.

18. And you shall not take a wife to her sister, to vex [her], to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life.

19. Also you shall not approach to a woman to uncover her nakedness in the impurity of her uncleanness.

20. And you shall not lie carnally with your neighbor's wife, to defile yourself with her.

21. And you shall not let any of your seed pass through [the fire] to Molech, neither shall you profane the name of your God. I [am] the LORD.

22. You shall not lie with mankind as with womankind. It [is] abomination [to God].

23. And you shall not lie with any animal to defile yourself with it. And a woman shall not stand before an animal to lie down to it. It [is] a perversion.

24. Do not defile yourselves in any of these things. For in all these the nations are defiled, which I cast out before you.

25. And the land is defiled. Therefore I visit its wickedness on it, and the land itself vomits out those who live in it.

26. You shall therefore keep My statutes and My judgments, and shall not commit [any] of these abominations, [neither] the native, nor any stranger that lives among you.

27. For the men of the land who [were] before you have done all these abominations, and the land is defiled.

28. [You shall not do these] so that the land may not spew you out also when you defile it, as it spewed out the nations that [were] before you.

29. For whoever shall commit [any] of these abominations, even the souls who commit [them] shall be cut off from among their people.

30. And you shall keep My ordinance, so as not to do [any] of these abominable customs which were committed before you, and that you do not defile yourselves in them. I [am] the LORD your God.

## Leviticus 19

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to all the congregation of the sons of Israel and say to them, You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God [am] holy.

3. You shall each man revere his mother and his father, and keep My sabbaths. I [am] the LORD your God.

4. Do not turn to idols, nor make molten gods to yourselves. I [am] the LORD your God.

5. And if you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, you shall offer it of your own free will.

6. It shall be eaten the same day you offer it, and on the next day. And if anything remains until the third day, it shall be burned in the fire.

7. And if it is eaten at all on the third day, it [is] abominable. It shall not be accepted.

8. And anyone that eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the holy thing of the LORD. And that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

9. And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corner of your field. And you shall not gather the gleaning of your harvest.

10. And you shall not glean your vineyard. And you shall not gather the leavings of your vineyard. You shall leave them for the poor and the stranger. I [am] the LORD your God.

11. You shall not steal, nor lie, nor be deceitful to one another.

12. And you shall not swear by My name falsely; nor shall you profane the name of your God. I [am] the LORD.

13. You shall not defraud your neighbor nor rob [him]. The wages of him who is hired shall not stay with you until the morning.

14. You shall not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling-block before the blind, but shall fear your God. I [am] the LORD.

15. You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment. You shall not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty; [but] you shall judge your neighbor in righteousness.

16. You shall not go [as] a slanderer among your people; you shall not stand against the blood of your neighbor. I [am] the LORD.

17. You shall not hate your brother in your heart. You shall always rebuke your neighbor, and not allow sin on him.

18. You shall not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the sons of your people; but you shall love your neighbor as yourself. I [am] the LORD.

19. You shall keep My statutes. You shall not let your cattle breed with different kinds. You shall not sow your field with two kinds [of] seed. And you shall not allow clothing mixed of linen and wool to come on you.

20. And whoever lies with a woman with semen, and she is a slave-girl, betrothed to a husband and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her, there shall be an inquest. They shall not be put to death, because she was not free.

21. And he shall bring his trespass offering to the LORD, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering.

22. And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he has done. And the sin which he has done shall be forgiven him.

23. And when you shall come into the land, and shall have planted all kinds of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit of them as uncircumcised. It shall be uncircumcised three years to you. It shall not be eaten.

24. But in the fourth year all the fruit of them shall be holy to praise the LORD.

25. And in the fifth year you shall eat of the fruit of it, so that it may yield to you its increase. I [am] the LORD your God.

26. You shall not eat [anything] with the blood. You shall not divine, nor conjure [spirits].

27. You shall not round the side of your head, nor mar the edge of your beard.

28. You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks on you. I [am] the LORD.

29. You shall not prostitute your daughter, to cause her to be a whore, lest the land go whoring, and the land become full of wickedness.

30. You shall keep My sabbaths and revere My sanctuary. I [am] the LORD.

31. You shall not turn to those that have familiar spirits, nor seek to spiritists to be defiled by them. I [am] the LORD your God.

32. You shall rise up before the gray head and honor the face of the old man, and fear your God. I [am] the LORD.

33. And if a stranger lives with you in your land, you shall not oppress him.

34. The stranger that dwells with you shall be to you as one born among you, and you shall love him as yourself. For you were strangers in the land of Egypt. I [am] the LORD your God.

35. You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measures and weights, or in quantity.

36. You shall have just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin. I [am] the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.

37. And you shall observe all My statutes and all My judgments, and do them. I [am] the LORD.

## Leviticus 20

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Again you shall say to the sons of Israel, Any man of the sons of Israel or of the strangers who live in Israel, that gives any of his seed to Molech, he shall surely be put to death. The people of the land shall stone him with stones.

3. And I will set My face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given of his seed to Molech, to defile My sanctuary, and to profane My holy name.

4. And if the people of the land in any way hide their eyes from the man when he gives of his seed to Molech, and do not kill him,

5. then I will set My face against that man and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go lusting after him to commit adultery with Molech, from among their people.

6. And the soul that turns to mediums, and to spirit-knowers, to go lusting after them, I will even set My face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.

7. And you shall sanctify yourselves, and be holy. For I [am] the LORD your God.

8. And you shall keep My statutes and do them. I the LORD sanctify you.

9. And any man who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death. He has cursed his father or his mother; his blood [shall be] on him.

10. And a man who commits adultery with a man's wife, who commits adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.

11. And the man who lies with his father's wife has uncovered his father's nakedness. Both of them shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be on them.

12. And if a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death. They have performed a perversion; their blood [shall be] on them.

13. If a man also lies with mankind, as he lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death. Their blood [shall be] on them.

14. And if a man takes a wife and her mother, it [is] wickedness. They shall be burned with fire, both he and they, so that there may be no wickedness among you.

15. And if a man lies with an animal, he shall surely be put to death. And you shall kill the animal.

16. And if a woman goes up to any animal and lies down with it, you shall kill the woman and the animal. They shall surely be put to death; their blood [shall be] on them.

17. And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness, it [is] a wicked thing. And they shall be cut off in the sight of their people. He has uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.

18. And if a man shall lie with a menstruous woman, and shall uncover her nakedness, he has discovered her fountain, and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood. And both of them shall be cut off from among their people.

19. And you shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister, nor of your father's sister. For he uncovers his near kin. They shall bear their iniquity.

20. And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he has uncovered his uncle's nakedness. They shall bear their sin. They shall die childless.

21. And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it [is] an unclean thing. He has uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.

22. You shall therefore keep all My statutes and all My judgments, and do them, so that the land where I bring you to live shall not spit you out.

23. And you shall not walk in the ways of the nation which I cast out before you. For they committed all these things, and therefore I loathed them.

24. But I have said to you, You shall inherit their land, and I, I am giving it to you to possess it, a land that flows with milk and honey. I [am] the LORD your God, who has separated you from the nations.

25. And you shall make a difference between clean animals and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean. And you shall not defile your souls by beast, or by fowl, or by any kind of living thing that creeps on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.

26. And you shall be holy to Me. For I, the LORD, am holy, and have severed you from the nations, so that you should be Mine.

27. A man also or woman that has a medium or that is a necromancer, shall surely be put to death. They shall stone them with stones. Their blood [is] on them.

## Leviticus 21

1. And the LORD said to Moses, Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people.

2. But for his kin that is near him, for his mother and for his father and for his son and for his daughter and for his brother

3. and for his sister, a virgin, who is near to him, who has had no husband, for her he may be defiled.

4. A leader shall not defile himself among his people, to pollute himself.

5. They shall not make baldness on their head, nor shall they shave the corner of their beard, nor make any cutting in their flesh.

6. They shall be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God. For they offer the fire offerings of the LORD, the bread of their God. Therefore they shall be holy.

7. They shall not take a wife [who is] a whore, or defiled. Neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband. For he [is] holy to his God.

8. And you shall sanctify him, for he offers the bread of your God. He shall be holy to you. For I [am] holy, the LORD who sanctifies you.

9. And the daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by going whoring, she profanes her father. She shall be burned with fire.

10. And the high priest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil was poured and who is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head nor tear his clothes.

11. Neither shall he come near to any dead person, nor defile himself for his father nor for his mother.

12. Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God [is] on him. I [am] the LORD.

13. And he shall take a wife in her virginity.

14. He shall not take a widow or a divorced woman, or profane, [or] a harlot, but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife.

15. And he shall not defile his seed among his people. For I the LORD do sanctify him.

16. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

17. Speak to Aaron, saying, No man of your seed in their generations shall draw near to offer the bread of his God if there is a blemish in him.

18. For no man in whom [there is] a blemish shall draw near, a blind man, or a lame man, or disfigured, or deformed,

19. or a man that is broken-footed, or broken-handed,

20. or crook-backed, or a crushed one, or who has a blemish in his eye, or a scurvy or scabbed person, or one with crushed testicles.

21. No man of the seed of Aaron, the priest, in whom there is a blemish shall come near to offer the fire offerings of the LORD. He has a blemish; he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.

22. He shall eat the bread of his God, of the most holy and of the holy.

23. Only he shall not go in to the veil, nor come near to the altar, because he has a blemish; so that he does not profane My sanctuaries. For I the LORD do sanctify them.

24. And Moses told Aaron and his sons, and all the sons of Israel.

## Leviticus 22

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to Aaron and to his sons, that they set themselves apart from the holy things of the sons of Israel, and that they do not profane My holy name [in what] they devote to Me. I [am] the LORD.

3. Say to them, Any man of all your seed among your generations who draws near to the holy things, which the sons of Israel set apart to the Lord, if he has his uncleanness on him, that soul shall be cut off from My presence. I [am] the LORD.

4. Any man of the seed of Aaron who [is] leprous, or has a discharge, he shall not eat of the holy things until he is clean. And he who touches any uncleanness of a person, or a man whose semen has gone out from him,

5. or a man who touches any swarming thing by which he may be made unclean, or touches a man who is unclean to him, by any uncleanness he has,

6. the soul which has touched it shall be unclean until evening. And he shall not eat of the holy things unless he washes his flesh with water.

7. And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things, because it [is] his food.

8. He shall not eat a dead body or one torn, to defile himself with them. I [am] the LORD.

9. And they shall keep My ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, that they may not die for it when they defile it. I the LORD sanctify them.

10. There shall no stranger eat [of] the holy things. A tenant of a priest, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.

11. But if the priest buys a soul with his silver, he shall eat of it. And one born in his house shall eat of his food.

12. And a priest's daughter, when she belongs to a man, a stranger, she may not eat of the heave offering of the holy things.

13. But if the priest's daughter is a widow, or put away, and has no child, and has returned to her father's house, as [in] her youth, she shall eat of her father's food. But no stranger shall eat of it.

14. And if a man eats a holy thing without knowing it, then he shall put the fifth part to it, and shall give to the priest with the holy thing.

15. And they shall not profane the holy things of the sons of Israel which they offer to the LORD,

16. and so load on them the iniquity of the guilt offering in their eating of their holy things. For I [am] the LORD who sanctifies them.

17. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

18. Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel, and say to them: Any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, who offers his sacrifices for his vows, for all his free-will offerings, which they will offer to the LORD for a burnt offering,

19. [you shall offer] at your own will a male without blemish, of the cattle, of the sheep, or of the goats.

20. You shall not offer that which has a blemish. For it shall not be acceptable for you.

21. And when a man offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD to carry out [his] vow, or a free-will offering in cattle or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted. There shall be no blemish in them.

22. Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a running sore, or having scurvy, or scabbed, you shall not offer these to the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them on the altar to the LORD.

23. As to a young bull or a sheep that is deformed or dwarfed, you may offer that [for] a free-will offering. But for a vow it shall not be accepted.

24. You shall not offer to the LORD that which is bruised or crushed, or broken or cut. You shall not make [any offering] of it in your land.

25. And you shall not offer the bread of your God out of the hand of a son of a stranger, or any of these, because their uncleanness [is] in them, and blemishes are in them. They shall not be accepted for you.

26. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

27. When a bull or a lamb or a goat is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam. And from the eighth day and from then on, it shall be accepted for a fire offering to the LORD.

28. But a bull or sheep, it and its young one, you shall not kill it in one day.

29. And when you will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, offer [it] at your own will.

30. On the same day it shall be eaten up. You shall leave none of it until morning. I [am] the LORD.

31. And you shall keep My commandments, and do them. I [am] the LORD.

32. And you shall not profane My holy name. But I will be holy among the sons of Israel. I [am] the LORD who is sanctifying you,

33. who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. I [am] the LORD.

## Leviticus 23

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, The feasts of the LORD, which you shall proclaim, holy convocations, even these are My appointed feasts.

3. Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day [is] the sabbath of rest, a holy convocation. You shall not do any work. It [is] a sabbath to the LORD in all your dwellings.

4. These [are] the appointed feasts of the LORD, holy convocations which you shall proclaim in their appointed seasons.

5. In the fourteenth [day] of the first month, between the evenings, is the LORD's Passover,

6. and on the fifteenth day of the same month [is] the Feast of Unleavened [Bread] to the LORD. You must eat unleavened [bread] seven days.

7. On the first day you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no work of labor,

8. but you shall offer a fire offering to the LORD seven days. In the seventh day [is] a holy convocation. You shall do no work of labor.

9. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

10. Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When you have come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap the harvest of it, then you shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest.

11. And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD to be received for you. On the next day after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.

12. And you shall offer that day when you wave the sheaf, a male lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering to the LORD.

13. And its food offering [shall be] two-tenth parts of fine flour mixed with oil, a fire offering to the LORD for a sweet savor. And the drink offering of it [shall be] of wine, the fourth [part] of a hin.

14. And you shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor green ears, until the same day, until you have brought an offering to your God. [It shall be] a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

15. And you shall count to you from the next day after the sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete.

16. To the next day after the seventh sabbath you shall number fifty days. And you shall offer a new food offering to the LORD.

17. You shall bring out of your homes two wave loaves of two-tenth parts. They shall be of fine flour. They shall be baked with leaven, firstfruits to the LORD.

18. And you shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bull, and two rams. They shall be [for] a burnt offering to the LORD, with their food offering, and their drink offerings, a fire offering of sweet savor to the LORD.

19. Then you shall sacrifice one he-goat for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.

20. And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits, a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs. They shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.

21. And you shall proclaim on the same day [that] it may be a holy convocation to you. You shall do no work of labor. [It shall be] a statute forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.

22. And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not completely reap the corner of your field. When you reap the gleaning of your harvest, you shall not gather. You shall leave them to the poor and to the stranger. I [am] the LORD your God.

23. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

24. Speak to the sons of Israel saying: In the seventh month, in the first [day] of the month, you shall have a sabbath, a memorial summons, a holy convocation.

25. You shall do no work of labor but you shall offer a fire offering to the LORD.

26. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

27. Also, on the tenth of this seventh month, this is a day of atonement. [It shall be] a holy convocation to you. And you shall afflict your souls and offer a fire offering to the LORD.

28. And you shall do no work in that same day, for it [is] a day of atonement, in order to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.

29. For any soul who is not humbled in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.

30. And any soul who does any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.

31. You shall do no kind of work. [It shall be] a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

32. It [shall be] to you a sabbath of rest, and you shall humble your souls. In the ninth of the month at evening, from evening to evening, you shall keep your sabbath.

33. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

34. Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month [shall be] the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days to the LORD.

35. On the first day [shall be] a holy convocation. You shall do no work of labor.

36. Seven days you shall offer a fire offering to the LORD. On the eighth day shall be a holy convocation to you. And you shall offer a fire offering to the LORD. It [is] a solemn assembly. And you shall do no work of labor.

37. These [are] the feasts of the LORD which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer a fire offering to the LORD, a burnt offering and a food offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, everything on its day;

38. besides the sabbath of the LORD, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your free-will offerings which you give to the LORD.

39. Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruit of the land, you shall keep a feast to the LORD seven days. On the first day [shall be] a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.

40. And you shall take the fruit of majestic trees for yourselves on the first day, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook. And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.

41. And you shall keep it a feast to the LORD seven days in the year. [It shall be] a statute forever in your generations. You shall keep it in the seventh month.

42. You shall live in booths seven days. All that are born Israelites shall live in booths,

43. so that your generations may know that I made the sons of Israel live in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I [am] the LORD your God.

44. And Moses declared the feasts of the LORD to the sons of Israel.

## Leviticus 24

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Command the sons of Israel that they bring to you pure olive oil, beaten, for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.

3. Aaron shall order it from evening until the morning before the LORD forever outside the veil of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation. [It shall be] a statute forever in your generations.

4. He shall order the lamps on the pure lampstand before the LORD forever.

5. And you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes of it. Two-tenth parts shall be in one cake.

6. And you shall set them in two rows, six [on] a row, on the pure table before the LORD.

7. And you shall put pure frankincense on [each] row, so that it may be on the bread for a memorial, a fire offering to the LORD.

8. Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD forever, from the sons of Israel by an everlasting covenant.

9. And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'. And they shall eat it in the holy place, for it [is] most holy to him of the fire offerings of the LORD, by a never-ending statute.

10. And the son of a woman of Israel, whose father [was] an Egyptian, went out among the sons of Israel. And this son of the woman of Israel and a man of Israel struggled together in the camp.

11. And the son of the woman of Israel blasphemed the name [of the LORD], and cursed. And they brought him to Moses. (And his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)

12. And they put him under guard, so that the mind of the LORD might be declared to them.

13. And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

14. Bring forth the despiser outside the camp. And let all that heard lay their hands on his head. Let all the congregation stone him.

15. And you shall speak to the sons of Israel saying, Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.

16. And he that blasphemes the Name of the LORD shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall surely stone him. And the stranger as well, even as he that is born in the land; when he blasphemes the Name, he shall be put to death.

17. And he who kills any man shall surely be put to death.

18. And he who kills an animal shall make it good, animal for animal.

19. And if a man causes a blemish in his neighbor, as he has done, so shall it be done to him:

20. break for break, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. As he has caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him.

21. And he who kills an animal shall restore it. And he who kills a man shall be put to death.

22. One judgment shall be for you whether an alien or a native; for I [am] the LORD your God.

23. And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel that they should bring the despiser outside the camp, and stone him with stones. And the sons of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.

## Leviticus 25

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses in Mount Sinai, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When you come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath to the LORD.

3. You shall sow your field six years, and you shall prune your vineyard six years, and gather in the fruit of it.

4. But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest to the land, a sabbath for the LORD. You shall neither sow your field, nor prune your vineyard.

5. You shall not reap that which grows of its own accord of your harvest, neither gather the grapes of your undressed vine. It is a year of rest to the land.

6. And the sabbath of the land shall be food for you, for you and for your servant, and for your slave woman and for your hired servant, and for your stranger who stays with you,

7. and for your cattle, and for the beast that [is] in your land, shall all the increase of it be for food.

8. And you shall number seven sabbaths of years to you, seven times seven years. And the time of the seven sabbaths of years shall be forty-nine years to you.

9. Then you shall cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth of the seventh month; in the day of atonement, the trumpet shall sound throughout all your land.

10. And you shall make the fiftieth year holy, [one] year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee to you, and you shall return each man to his possession, and you shall return each man to his family.

11. That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee to you. You shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself in it, nor gather in it of your undressed vine.

12. For it [is] the jubilee. It shall be holy to you. You shall eat the increase of it out of the field.

13. In the year of this jubilee you shall return each man to his possession.

14. And if you sell anything to your neighbor, or buy from your neighbor's hand, you shall not oppress one another.

15. According to the number of years after the jubilee you shall buy of your neighbor, according to the number of years of the fruits he shall sell to you.

16. According to the number of years you shall increase the price of it, and according to the fewness of years you shall diminish the price of it, for he is selling to you the number of crops.

17. And you shall not oppress one another. But you shall fear your God. For I [am] the LORD your God.

18. And you shall do My statutes, and keep My judgments and do them. And you shall dwell in the land in safety.

19. And the land shall yield its fruits, and you shall eat your fill and dwell in it in safety.

20. And if you shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not sow nor gather in our increase!

21. Then I will command My blessing on you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.

22. And you shall sow the eighth year, and eat of old fruit until the ninth year; until its fruits come in, you shall eat the old fruit.

23. The land shall not be sold forever; for the land [is] Mine. For you are strangers and pilgrims with Me.

24. And in all the land of your possession you shall grant a redemption for the land.

25. If your brother has become poor, and has sold his possessions, and if any of his relatives come to redeem it, then he shall redeem that which his brother sold.

26. And if the man has no redeemer, and he himself is able to redeem it, and he has enough [for] its redemption;

27. then let him count the years of the sale of it, and restore the overplus to the man to whom he sold it, so that he may return to his possession.

28. But if he is not able to restore to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that has bought it until the year of jubilee. And in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession.

29. And if a man sells a dwelling house [in] a walled city, then he may redeem it [within] a whole year after it is sold. He may redeem it within a full year.

30. And if it is not redeemed within the time of a full year, then the house in the walled city shall be made sure forever to its buyer throughout his generations. It shall not go out in the jubilee.

31. But the houses of the villages which have no walls around them shall be counted as the field of the country. They may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.

32. As to the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, the Levites shall have a never-ending redemption.

33. And if a man purchases [a house] from the Levites, then the house that was sold and the city of his possession shall go out in [the year of] jubilee. For the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the sons of Israel.

34. But the field of the open land of their cities may not be sold, for it [is] theirs forever.

35. And if your brother has become poor, and his hand has failed with you, then you shall help him; yes, [even if he is] a stranger or a visitor, so that he may live with you.

36. You shall take no interest from him, or increase. But you shall fear your God, so that your brother may live with you.

37. You shall not give him your silver on interest, nor lend him your food for increase.

38. I [am] the LORD your God who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan [and] to be your God.

39. And if your brother [who lives] beside you has become poor, and is sold to you, you shall not compel him to serve as a bond-servant.

40. As a hired servant, as a temporary resident, he shall be with you, and shall serve you until the year of jubilee.

41. And he shall depart from you, he and his sons with him, and shall return to his own family. And he shall return to the possession of his fathers.

42. For they [are] My servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt. They shall not be sold as a slave.

43. You shall not rule over him with rigor, but shall fear your God.

44. Both your male slaves, and your female slaves whom you shall have, [shall be] of the nations that are all around you. You shall buy male slaves and female slaves from them.

45. And also you may buy of the sons of the tenants who are staying with you; and from their families that [are] with you, whom they fathered in your land. And they shall be your possession.

46. And you shall take them as an inheritance [for] your sons after you, to hold [for] a possession; you may lay service on them forever. But you shall not rule over your brothers, the sons of Israel, over one another, with harshness.

47. And if an alien or a tenant lifts up a hand among you, and your brother [who dwells] beside him becomes poor and sells himself to the alien [or] tenant by you, or to the offshoot of the alien's family,

48. after he is sold he may be redeemed again. One of his brothers may redeem him;

49. either his uncle or his uncle's son may redeem him, or [any] that is near of kin to him of his family may redeem him. Or if he is able, he may redeem himself.

50. And he shall count with his buyer from the year that he was sold to him, until the year of jubilee. And the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years, according to the time of a hired servant it shall be with him.

51. If [there are] still many years, he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the silver that he was bought for, according to the years.

52. And if there remain but few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall count with him, [and] according to his years he shall give him again the price of his redemption.

53. As a yearly hired servant he shall be with him; he shall not rule with harshness in your sight.

54. And if he is not redeemed in this way, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he and his sons with him.

55. For to Me the sons of Israel [are] servants. They are My servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt. I [am] the LORD your God.

## Leviticus 26

1. You shall make no idols to yourselves; and you shall not set up for yourselves graven images, or a memorial pillar. And you shall not set up any image of stone in your land in order to bow down to it. For I [am] the LORD your God.

2. You shall keep My sabbaths and revere My sanctuary. I [am] the LORD.

3. If you walk in My statutes and keep My commandments and do them,

4. then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.

5. And your threshing shall reach to the vintage, and the vintage shall reach to the sowing time. And you shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.

6. And I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down and none shall make [you] afraid. And I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.

7. And you shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.

8. And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight. And your enemies shall fall by the sword in front of you.

9. For I will have respect to you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish My covenant with you.

10. And you shall eat of the old provision, and clear away the old because of the new.

11. And I will set My tabernacle among you. And My soul shall not abhor you.

12. And I will walk among you and will be your God, and you shall be My people.

13. I [am] the LORD your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, from being their bondmen. And I have broken the bonds of your yoke, and made you go upright.

14. But if you will not listen to Me, and will not do all these commandments,

15. and if you shall despise My statutes, or if your soul hates My judgments, so that you will not do all My commandments, so that you break My covenant;

16. I will also do this to you: I will even appoint terror over you, consumption, and burning fever, consuming the eyes and causing sorrow of heart. And you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.

17. And I will set My face against you, and you shall be slain before your enemies. They that hate you shall reign over you. And you shall flee when none pursues you.

18. And if you will not yet listen to Me for all this, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.

19. And I will break the pride of your power, and I will make your heaven like iron and your earth like bronze.

20. And your strength shall be spent in vain. For your land shall not yield its increase, neither shall the trees of the field yield their fruits.

21. And if you walk contrary to Me, and will not listen to Me, I will bring seven times more plagues on you according to your sins.

22. I will also send wild beasts among you, who shall bereave you. And I will destroy your cattle, and make you few. And your highways shall be deserted.

23. And if you will not be reformed by Me by these things, but will still walk contrary to Me,

24. then I will walk contrary to you and will punish you seven [times more] for your sins.

25. And I will bring a sword on you that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant. And when you are gathered inside your cities, I will send the plague among you. And you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.

26. When I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver [you] your bread again by weight. And you shall eat and not be satisfied.

27. And if you will not for all of this listen to Me, but will walk contrary to Me,

28. then I will walk contrary to you also in fury. And I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.

29. And you shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters you shall eat.

30. And I will destroy your high places and cut down your images, and throw your carcasses on the carcasses of your idols, and My soul shall despise you.

31. And I will make your cities waste and cause your sanctuaries to be deserted. And I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.

32. And I will turn the land into wasteland. And your enemies who dwell in it shall be astonished at it.

33. And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you. And your land shall be waste, and your cities waste.

34. Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lies waste, and [you are] in your enemies' land; then shall the land rest and enjoy its sabbaths.

35. As long as it lies waste it shall rest, because it did not rest in your sabbaths when you lived on it.

36. And on those of you that are left I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies. And the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them, and they shall flee as if fleeing from a sword. And they shall fall when none pursues.

37. And they shall fall on one another, as if it were before a sword, when none pursues. And you shall have no power to stand before your enemies.

38. And you shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.

39. And they that are left of you shall putrefy in their wilful sin in your enemies' lands. And also they shall putrefy with them in the perversities of their fathers.

40. If they shall confess their wilfulness and the wilfulness of their fathers, with their sin which they sinned against Me, and that also they have walked contrary to Me--

41. I also have walked contrary to them and have brought them into the land of their enemies. If then their uncircumcised hearts are humbled, and they then pay for their iniquity,

42. then I will remember My covenant with Jacob, and also My covenant with Isaac, and also My covenant with Abraham I will remember. And I will remember the land.

43. The land also shall be forsaken by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, while it lies waste without them. And they shall accept the punishment of their iniquities; because, even because they despised My judgments, and because their soul hated My statutes.

44. And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I hate them, to destroy them utterly and to break My covenant with them. For I [am] the LORD their God.

45. But for their sakes, I will remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, so that I might be their God. I [am] the LORD.

46. These [are] the statutes and judgments and laws, which the Lord made between Him and the sons of Israel in Mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.

## Leviticus 27

1. And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

2. Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When a man shall make a special vow, the persons [shall be] for the LORD by your evaluation.

3. And your judgment shall be of the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even your judgment shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.

4. And if it [is] a female, then your judgment shall be thirty shekels.

5. And if from five years old to twenty years old, then your judgment shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.

6. And if from a month old to five years old, then your judgment shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female your judgment [shall be] three shekels of silver.

7. And if from sixty years old and above, if it is a male then your judgment shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.

8. But if he is poorer than your judgment, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him. The priest shall value him according to the ability of him who vowed.

9. And if [it is] an animal of which they bring an offering to the LORD, all that one gives of such to the LORD shall be holy.

10. He shall not alter it nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good. And if he shall at all change animal for animal, then it and the exchange of it shall be holy.

11. And if [it is] any unclean animal, of which they do not offer a sacrifice to the LORD, then he shall present the animal before the priest.

12. And the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad. As you the priest value it, so shall it be.

13. But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth [part] of it to what you judged.

14. And when a man shall sanctify his house [to be] holy to the LORD, then the priest shall judge it, whether it is good or bad. As the priest shall judge it, so shall it stand.

15. And if he who sanctified it desires to redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth [part] of the silver of your judgment, and it shall be his.

16. And if a man shall sanctify to the LORD [some part] of a field that he owns, then your judgment shall be according to its seed; a homer of barley seed at fifty shekels of silver.

17. If he sanctifies his field from the year of jubilee, according to your judgment it shall stand.

18. But if he sanctifies his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the silver according to the years that remain, even until the year of jubilee, and it shall be taken from your estimation.

19. And if he who sanctified the field desires in any way to redeem it, then he shall add the fifth [part] of the money of your estimation to it, and it shall be made sure to him.

20. And if he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.

21. But the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, shall be holy to the LORD, as a field devoted. The possession of it shall be the priest's.

22. And if [a man] sanctifies to the LORD a field which he has bought, which [is] not of the fields he owns,

23. then the priest shall count to him the worth of your estimation, until the year of jubilee. And he shall give your estimation in that day, a holy thing to the LORD.

24. In the year of the jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, to him who owns [it in] the land.

25. And all your judgments shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary, twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.

26. However, the first-born of an animal, which should be the LORD's first-born, no man shall sanctify it, whether an ox, or sheep, it is the LORD's.

27. And if [it is] of an unclean animal, then he shall redeem it according to your estimation, and shall add a fifth [part] of it to it. Or if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your estimation.

28. However, no devoted thing that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he has, either of man or animal, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed. Every devoted thing [is] most holy to the LORD.

29. Nothing devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed, [but] shall surely be put to death.

30. And all the tithe of the land, of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, [is] the LORD's. [It is] holy to the LORD.

31. And if a man will at all redeem anything of his tithes, he shall add to it the fifth [part] of it.

32. And all the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, all that passes under the rod, a tenth shall be holy to the LORD

33. He shall not search whether it is good or bad, neither shall he change it. And if he changes it at all, then both it and the change of it shall be holy. It shall not be redeemed.

34. These [are] the commandments which the LORD commanded Moses for the sons of Israel in Mount Sinai.
