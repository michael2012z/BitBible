# Haggai

## Haggai 1

1. In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, the Word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high Priest, saying,

2. So says the LORD of hosts, saying: This people says, The time has not come, the time that Jehovah's house should be built.

3. Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,

4. [Is it] time for you yourselves to dwell in your finished houses, and shall this House lie waste?

5. And now so says the LORD of hosts: Set your heart on your ways;

6. you have sown much and bring in little; [you] eat, but you do not have enough; you drink, but you are not filled with drink; you dress, but no one is warm; and he who hires out himself hires himself for a bag full of holes.

7. So says the LORD of hosts: Set your heart on your ways.

8. Go up the mountain and bring wood, and build this House; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, says the LORD.

9. You looked for much, and behold, little! And when you brought [it] home, then I blew on it. Why, says the LORD of hosts? Because of My House that is waste, and you, [each] man runs to his own house.

10. Therefore the heavens above you have held back the dew, and the earth is held back [from] her produce.

11. And I called for a drought in the land, and on the mountains, and on the grain, and on the new wine, and on the oil, and on that which the ground brings forth, and on men, and on cattle, and on all the labor of your hands.

12. Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him. And the people feared before the LORD.

13. Then Haggai, the LORD's messenger, spoke the message of the LORD to the people, saying, I [am] with you, says the LORD.

14. And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. And they came and worked on the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,

15. in the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.

## Haggai 2

1. In the seventh [month], in the twenty-first of the month, the Word of the LORD came by the prophet Haggai, saying,

2. Now speak to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,

3. Who [is] left among you who saw this house in her first glory? And how do you see it now? When compared to it, [is it] not as nothing in your eyes?

4. Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, says the LORD. And be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; and be strong all people of the land, says the LORD, and work; for I [am] with you, says the LORD of hosts

5. [with the] Word who cut a covenant with you when you came out of Egypt, and My Spirit remains among you. Do not fear.

6. For so says the LORD of hosts: Yet once, it [is] a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land.

7. And I will shake all the nations; and the desire of all nations shall come; and I will fill this house with glory, says the LORD of hosts.

8. The silver [is] Mine, and the gold [is] Mine, says the LORD of hosts.

9. The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former, says the LORD of hosts. And in this place I will give peace, says the LORD of hosts.

10. In the twenty-fourth of the ninth [month], in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet, saying,

11. So says the LORD of hosts: Now ask the priests the law, saying,

12. If one carries holy flesh in the [skirt] of his garment, and touches his [skirt] to bread, or boiled food, or wine, or oil, or any food, will it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No.

13. Then Haggai said, If [one] unclean of body touches these, is it unclean? And the priests answered and said, It is unclean.

14. And Haggai answered and said, So [is] this people, and so [is] this nation before Me, says the LORD. And so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there [is] unclean.

15. And now, I ask you, set your heart on it; from this day and onward, before the placing of a stone on a stone in the temple of the LORD;

16. from then onward, [one] came to a heap of twenty [measures], and there were [but] ten; one came to the wine vat to draw off fifty from the winepress, and there were [but] twenty.

17. I struck you with blight and with mildew, and with hail, in all the labors of your hands; yet you did not [turn] to Me, says the LORD.

18. Now set your heart from this day and forward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth [month], from the day that the LORD's temple was founded. Set your heart:

19. [Is] the seed still in the barn? Yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, have not brought forth. From this day I will bless [you].

20. And a second time the Word of the LORD came to Haggai in the twenty-fourth of the month, saying,

21. Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth.

22. And I will overthrow the throne of the kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. And I will overthrow the chariots and their riders. And the horses and their riders shall come down, each one by the sword of his brother.

23. In that day, says the LORD of hosts, I will take you, O Zerubbabel, My servant, the son of Shealtiel, says the LORD, and will make you like a signet; for I have chosen you, says the LORD of hosts.
