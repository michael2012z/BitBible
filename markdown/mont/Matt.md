# Matthew

## Matthew 1

1. The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.

2. Abraham was the father of Isaac; Isaac was the father of Jacob;  Jacob, of Judah and his brethren;

3. Judah (by Tamar), of Perez and Zerah; Perez, of Hezron; Hezron, of Ram;

4. Ram, of Amminadab; Amminadab, of Nahshon; Nahshon, of Salmon;

5. Salmon (by Rahab), of Boaz; Boaz (by Ruth), of Obed; Obed, of Jesse;

6. And Jesse, of David the king. David (by Uriahs widow), was the father of Solomon;

7. Solomon, of Rehoboam; Rehoboam, of Abijah; Abijah, of Asa;

8. Asa, of Jehoshaphat; Jehoshaphat, of Joram; Joram, of Uzziah;

9. Uzziah, of Jotham; Jotham, of Ahaz; Ahaz, of Hezekiah;

10. Hezekiah, of Manasseh; Manasseh, of Amon; Amon, of Josiah;

11. Josiah, of Jechoniah and his brethren, at the time of the carrying away to Babylon.

12. And after the carrying away into Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel; Shealtiel, of Zerubbabel;

13. Zerubbabel, of Abiud; Abiud, of Eliakim; Eliakim, of Azor;

14. Azor, of Sadoc; Sadoc, of Achim; Achim, of Eliud;

15. Eliud, of Eleazar; Eleazar, of Matthan; Matthan, of Jacob;

16. And Jacob, of Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus,  who is called Christ.

17. So the whole number of generations from Abraham to David is fourteen; from David to the exile to Babylon is fourteen; and from the exile to Babylon to Christ is fourteen.

18. The birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. After his mother,  Mary, had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.

19. But Joseph her husband, because he was just a man and unwilling to disgrace her, was minded to put her away secretly.

20. And while he was having this in mind, behold! an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying.

21. "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife home,  for what is begotten in her is by the Holy Spirit; and she will bear a son, and you are to call him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."

22. All this happened that the word of the Lord spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled.

23. Behold! the virgin shall be with child, and shall bear a son; and they shall call his name Immanuel, a word which means "God with us."

24. Now when Joseph awoke from his sleep he did as the angel of the Lord had directed him, and took his wife home,

25. but did not live with her until after the birth of her son, whom he called Jesus.

## Matthew 2

1. After the birth of Jesus, which took place at Bethlehem in Judea,  during the reign of King Herod, lo! certain Magi arrived in Jerusalem, saying.

2. "Where is the new-born King of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the East, and are come to worship him."

3. When King Herod heard this he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.

4. So when he had gathered together all the chief priests and rabbis of the people, he began to inquire of them where the Christ was to be born.

5. And they told him. "At Bethlehem in Judea, as it is written in the prophet.

6. "And thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah, Thou are not least among the princes of Judah, For out of thee shall come a ruler Who shall shepherd my people, Israel."

7. Thereupon Herod sent secretly for the Magi, and found out from them the time when the star appeared.

8. Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and make careful inquiry about the child, and as soon as you have found him bring me word,  that I, too, may go and worship him."

9. The Magi listened to the king, and went on their way, and lo! the star which they had seen in the east led them until it came and stood over the place where the young child was.

10. And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with great gladness.

11. When they had entered the house, they saw the child with Mary, his mother, and opening their treasure-chests they gave him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.

12. But because they were forbidden by God in a dream to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by another route.

13. When they were gone an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying; "Rise! Take the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt, and there remain until I bring you word; for Herod intends to make a search for the child, in order to put him to death."

14. So Joseph arose, took the child and his mother, by night, and departed to Egypt.

15. There he remained until the death of Herod, in order that the word of the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, which says, Out of Egypt I called my son.

16. As soon as Herod saw that he had been mocked by the Magi, he was furious. He sent and put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and all the neighborhood who were two years old or under, in accordance with the date which he had ascertained from the Magi.

17. Then were fulfilled the words spoken through Jeremiah, the prophet,  saying,

18. A voice was heard in Ramah, Weeping and lamentation- Rachel weeping for her children, Inconsolable, because they were no more!

19. But after Herods death an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,

20. saying, "Rise! Take the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the life of the child are dead."

21. So he rose and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.

22. But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there; and being warned of God in a dream, he withdrew into Galilee and settled in a town called Nazareth,

23. in fulfillment of the word spoken through the Prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.

## Matthew 3

1. In those days came John the Baptist preaching in the desert of Judea;

2. "Repent," said he, "for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."

3. This Johnit was of whom it was said through Isaiah, the prophet, The voice of one who cries aloud in the desert, "Prepare a way for the Lord, Make the paths straight for him."

4. This Johnwore a garment of camels hair, and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.

5. Then Jerusalem began to go out to him, and all Judea, and the whole neighborhood of the Jordan,

6. and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.

7. But when Johnsaw that many of the Pharisees and Sadducees were coming for baptism, he said. "O brood of vipers! Who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

8. Then bring forth fruit worthy of repentance.

9. And do not presume to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father-I tell you that out of these very stones God is able to raise up descendants for Abraham.

10. And already the axe is lying at the roots of the trees. Any tree,  therefore, that does not bear good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.

11. I indeed am baptizing you in water, unto repentance; but One is coming after me, mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire.

12. His winnowing-fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse the threshing-floor. He will store his wheat in the granary, but will burn up the chaff in unquenchable fire."

13. At that very time Jesus was on his way from Galilee to the Jordan,  to John, to be baptized by him.

14. But he tried to prevent him. "It is I," he said, "who need to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?"

15. But Jesus answered, "Permit it now, for so it is fitting for us to fulfill every religious duty."

16. Then he consented. And after Jesus was baptized, as soon as he rose out of the water, lo! the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon him,

17. while a voice from heaven said, "This is my son, the beloved, In whom I delight."

## Matthew 4

1. Then Jesus was led up into the desert by the Spirit, to be tempted by the devil.

2. And after he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he became hungry,

3. So the tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, bid these stones to become bread."

4. Jesus answered him, "It is written, Not by bread alone shall man live, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God."

5. Then the devil took him up into the Holy City and stood him on the parapet of the temple,

6. and said to him. "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down;  for it is written, "He will give his angels charge over thee; Upon their hands they will bear thee up, Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone."

7. "It is written again," answered Jesus, "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."

8. Then the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain, and showed all the kingdoms of the earth and the glory of them,

9. and said to him, "All these will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me."

10. "Begone, Satan!" answered Jesus, "for it is written, "Thou must worship the Lord thy God, and Him only must thou serve."

11. Then the devil left him, and behold! angels came and began ministering to him.

12. Now when Jesus heard that Johnhad been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee.

13. He left Nazareth, and settled in Capernaum-by-the-Lake, near the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali,

14. in order that these words spoken through Isaiah the prophet, might be fulfilled.

15. Land of Zebulun, land of Naphtali; The road by the Lake; the country beyond Jordan; Galilee of the Gentiles!

16. The people who were dwelling in darkness Have seen a great light;  And on those who were dwelling in the land of the shadows of death Light has dawned.

17. From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent for the kingdom of heaven is near."

18. And as he was walking by the see of Galilee, he saw two brothers-  Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother-casting their net into the sea, for they were fishermen.

19. "Come, follow me," said Jesus, "And I will make you fishers of men."

20. And they dropped their nets at once, and followed him.

21. As he went farther on he saw two other brothers, Jamesthe son of Zebedee, and Johnhis brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father,  mending their nets, and he called them.

22. They immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.

23. Then Jesus went about through Galilee, teaching in the synagogues,  and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and infirmity among the people.

24. And his fame spread throughout all Syria. They brought all the sick to him, those who were suffering from various diseases and troubles-  demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics-and he healed them.

25. Great crowds followed him from Galilee, from the ten towns, from Jerusalem, and Judea, and from beyond Jordan.

## Matthew 5

1. When he saw the crowds, he went up the mountain, and when he had seated himself, his disciples came to him,

2. and opening his lips he began to teach them, saying.

3. "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs.

4. "Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.

5. "Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth."

6. "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for the righteousness, for they shall be completely satisfied.

7. "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.

8. "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.

9. "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.

10. "Blessed are those who have been persecuted in the cause of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

11. "Blessed are you when they shall revile you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my names sake.

12. "Rejoice and exult in it, because your reward was great in the heavens; for so did they persecute the prophets before you.

13. "You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt lose its savor, in what way shall it be salted? It is henceforth good for nothing but to be thrown out and trodden under foot of men.

14. "You are the light of the world. A city built on a hilltop cannot be hid;

15. "nor do men light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the lamp-stand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.

16. "So let your light shine before men that they may see good you do,  and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.

17. "Do not suppose that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I am come not to destroy, but to fulfil.

18. "In solemn truth I tell you that until heaven and earth pass away,  not an iota, not a comma, will pass from the Law until all has taken place.

19. "So whoever breaks one of these least commandments, and teaches others to break them, will be least in the kingdom of heaven. But he who keeps them and teaches them, he will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

20. "For I assure you that unless your righteousness exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not find entrance into the kingdom of heaven.

21. "You have heard that it was said to the ancients, "Thou shall not commit murder, and "he who commits murder shall be liable to condemnation by the court;

22. but I say to you that he who becomes angry with his brother shall be liable to condemnation by the court; and he who says to his brother Raca, shall be liable to condemnation by the Sanhedrin, while he who curses his brother shall be liable to the Gehenna of Fire.

23. "If therefore when you are offering your gift upon the altar, and there remember that your brother has a grievance against you,

24. "leave there your gift before the altar, and go and make friends with your brother, first of all; then come and offer your gift.

25. "Come to terms with your opponent quickly, while you are yet with him on the way to the court, to prevent your opponent from handing you over to the judge, and the judge to the jailer, and so you be thrown into prison.

26. "I tell you truly that you would certainly not get out from there until you had paid back the last cent.

27. "You have heard that it was said, "Thou shalt not commit adultery.

28. But I say to you that whoever looks with lust at a woman has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

29. And if your eye, your right eye, entices you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to lose one of your bodily organs, than to have your whole body go down into the pit.

30. And if your right hand entices you into sin, cut it off and cast it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of your bodily organs,  than to have your whole body go down into the pit.

31. "It was also said, "Whoever divorces his wife must give her a bill of separation.

32. But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of unchastity, makes her an adulteress, and whoever marries her when so divorced, commits adultery.

33. "Again you have heard that it was said to the men of old, "You must not forswear yourselves, but must perform your vows to the Lord.

34. "But I say to you, swear not at all; neither by the sky, for it is Gods throne;

35. "nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King.

36. "Nor must you swear by your head, since you cannot make one hair white or black.

37. "But let your word be simply Yes or No;anything beyond this comes from the Evil One.

38. "You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

39. "But I tell you not to retaliate the injury; but whoever strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to him also;

40. "and if any one wants to go to law with you and takes away your coat, let him take your cloak also.

41. "Whoever impresses you to go one mile, go two miles with him.

42. "Give to him who asks, and from him who wants to borrow from you, do not turn away.

43. "You have heard that it was said, "You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy."

44. "But I say to you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.

45. "So you will become sons of your heavenly Father; for he makes his sun to rise upon sinners as well as saints, and sends rain upon the unjust and the just.

46. "For if you love only those who love you, what reward have you?

47. "Even the tax-gatherers do that, do they not? And if you show courtesy to your brother only, what are you doing more than others?  Even the Gentiles do that, do they not?

48. "You then must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect."

## Matthew 6

1. "Be careful not to do your good deeds in the sight of men, in order to be observed by them. If you do, you have no reward with your heavenly Father.

2. "And whatever you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and streets, in order that men may praise them. In solemn truth I tell you they already have their reward in full.

3. "But when you give alms, do not let your right hand know what your left is doing,

4. "so that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.

5. "And whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the corners of the avenues, in order that men may see them. In solemn truth I tell you that they have their reward in full.

6. "But you, when you pray, go into your own room and shut your door;  pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.

7. "While praying do not say the same words over and over again, as the Gentiles do, for they suppose that by their much speaking they will gain attention.

8. "Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.

9. "So pray in this way. "Our Father who art in heaven, May thy name be hallowed,

10. thy kingdom come, and thy will be done, On earth, as in heaven.

11. Give us today our bread for the day before us;

12. And forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors;

13. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the Evil One;  For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory. Amen.

14. "For if you forgive men their offenses against you, your heavenly Father will forgive you also;

15. "but if you do not forgive men your offenses, neither will your heavenly Father forgive you your offenses.

16. "When you fast, do not look downcast like the hypocrites; for they disfigure their faces so that it may be apparent to men that they are fasting. In solemn truth I tell you, they already have received their reward.

17. "But when one of you fasts, let him anoint his head and wash his face,

18. "so that he may not appear to men to be fasting, but to his Father who is in secret; and his Father who sees in secret will reward him.

19. "Store up for yourselves no treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal;

20. "but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consume, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.

21. "For wherever your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

22. "The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore if your eye is sound,  your whole body will be well lighted;

23. "but if your eye is unsound, your whole body will be darkened. If then the very light within you is darkness, how dense is that darkness!

24. "No slave can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will pay heed to the one and despise the other.  You cannot be the slaves both of God and of gold.

25. "For this reason I say to you, do not be anxious about your life,  inquiring what you shall eat or what you shall drink, nor yet for your body, inquiring what you shall wear. Is not your life more than its food, and your body than its clothing?

26. "Behold! the birds in the sky! They neither sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them; and are not you worth more than they?

27. "Which one of you by being anxious is able to add even one cubit to his stature?

28. "Why be anxious then about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They toil not, neither do they spin.

29. "But I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory was robed like one of these.

30. "If God then so clothes the grass of the field, which blooms today,  and tomorrow is cast into the oven, will he not much more clothe you,  you of little faith?

31. "Then do not be anxious,saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or What shall we wear?"

32. "For all these are things that the Gentiles are eagerly seeking; for your heavenly Father knows that you have need of them all.

33. "But continue to seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.

34. "Do not then be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own anxieties. Enough for each day are its own troubles."

## Matthew 7

1. "Judge not, that you may be judged, yourselves;

2. "for with what judgment you judge, you will be judged, and in what measure you measure, others will measure to you.

3. "And why do you look at the mote in your brothers eye, and fail to notice the beam which is in your own eye?

4. "Or how will you say to your brother, Permit me to remove the mote from your eye, when, behold, the beam is in your own eye?

5. "Hypocrite! First cast out the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly how to cast the mote out of your brothers eye.

6. "Do not give what is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine; lest in turn they trample them under their feet, and then turn and attack you.

7. "Ask, and it will be given you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.

8. "For every one who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks the door is opened.

9. "What man of you is there who, when his son asks a loaf, will give him a stone?

10. "or if his son asks for a fish, will offer him a snake?

11. "If you then, evil as you are, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good gifts to those who ask him?

12. "Therefore everything that you would have men do to you, do you also the same to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.

13. "Enter by the narrow gate; for broad is the gate and wide the road that leads to destruction, and many are they who go in by it;

14. "but the gate is narrow and the road is steep, which leads to life,  and they are few who find it.

15. "Beware of the false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing,  but within they are ravening wolves.

16. "By their fruits you will know them. Are grapes gathered of thorns,  or figs of thistles?

17. "No, every good tree bears good fruit, but a worthless tree bears bad fruit.

18. "A good tree cannot bear bad fruit; neither can a worthless tree bear good fruit.

19. "Every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.

20. "Hence it is by their fruit you will know them.

21. "Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.

22. "Many in that day will say to me, "Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name, and in your name cast out demons, and in your name done many mighty works?

23. "Then I will tell them plainly, "I never knew you; depart from me,  you workers of iniquity.

24. "Every one who hears my words and does them I will liken to a wise man who built his house upon the rock.

25. "And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew,  and beat upon the house, but it fell not, for it was founded upon the rock.

26. "And every one who hears these words of mine and does them not, I will liken to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand.

27. "And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew,  and beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it."

28. Now when Jesus had finished his discourse, the crowds were astounded at his teaching, for he was teaching them as one having authority,  and not as their scribes taught them.

## Matthew 8

1. As he went down from the mountain, great crowds followed him.

2. And behold! a leper came and knelt before him, saying, "Lord if you choose, you can make me clean."

3. Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him "I do choose," he said,  "become clean," and immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy.

4. Jesus said to him, "See that you tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded, as an evidence to them."

5. When he entered Capernaum, an army captain came, and entered him,

6. saying, "Lord, my slave at home is lying ill with paralysis, in terrible agony."

7. "I will come and heal him," said Jesus.

8. "Lord, "said the captain in reply, "I am not worthy to have you under my roof, but speak the word only, and my slave will be cured,

9. "For I myself also am a man under authority, and I have soldiers under me. To one man I say Go, and he goes; to another,Come,  and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does it."

10. As Jesus listened to this reply he was astonished, and said to those who followed him. "In solemn truth I tell you that I have found faith like this in any Israelite.

11. "I tell you that many will come from the east and from the west, and sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.

12. "but the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness; there will be the wailing and the gnashing of teeth."

13. Then Jesus said to the captain. "Go! As you have believed, so be it unto you." And his slave was healed in that very hour.

14. When Jesus came into Peters house, he found his wifes mother prostrated with fever.

15. He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose and waited upon him.

16. At evening-time they brought to him many demoniacs. He cast out the demons with a word, and healed all who were ill,

17. that the word spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled,  He took upon himself our weaknesses, and bore the burden of our diseases.

18. When Jesus saw the great crowds about him, he had given directions to cross to the other side,

19. when a Scribe came up and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go!"

20. "Foxes have their holes," answered Jesus, "and wild birds their roosting-places, but the Son of man has not where to lay his head."

21. Another of his disciples said to him, "Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father,"

22. "Follow me," Jesus said to him, "and leave the dead to bury their own dead."

23. Then he went in board a fishing-boat, his disciples accompanying him;

24. and behold, a sudden storm arose on the sea, so that the boat began to be buried by the waves.

25. But he was asleep. And they came and woke him, saying. "Lord save us! We are drowning!"

26. "Why are you afraid?" he said, "you men of little faith!" Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there came a great calm.

27. But the men were amazed, saying, "What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?"

28. When he arrived on the other side, in the country of the Gadarenes,  he was met by two demoniacs who were coming out of the tombs. They were so violently fierce that no one dared pass along that road.

29. "You Son of God," they shouted, "what have you to do with us? Are you come to torment us before the time?"

30. Now there was, at some distance from them, a herd of many swine feeding;

31. and the demons began entreating him. "If you are driving us out,"  they said, "send us into the herd of swine."

32. He answered, "Go!" So they came out of the men, and went into the swine, and behold! the entire herd rushed headlong down from the cliff into the sea, and perished in the water.

33. The swineherds fled. They went away into the city and told all about it, and what had befallen the demoniacs.

34. At once all the citizens came out to meet Jesus; and when they had seen him, they begged him to move away from their country.

## Matthew 9

1. So he went on board, crossed the sea, and came to his own city.

2. And here they brought to him a paralytic lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic, "Courage, son, your sins are forgiven."

3. And behold! certain scribes said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming."

4. And because Jesus knew well their thought, he said.

5. "Why do you think evil in your hearts? For which is easier, to say Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise and walk?

6. "But that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins"- he then says to the paralytic, "Rise, take up your bed, and go to your home."

7. And he rose and went to his home.

8. But all the crowd were awestruck, and glorified God, who had given such power to men.

9. As Jesus was passing thence, he saw a man called Mathew sitting at the tax-office, and said to him, "Follow me."

10. And he rose and followed him. And while he was at table in Matthews house, there came many tax-gatherers and sinners, and they dined with Jesus and his disciples.

11. When the Pharisees saw it, they kept saying to his disciples, "Why does your Teacher eat with the tax-gatherers and sinners?"

12. "It is not those who are well," said Jesus, when he heard this, "but the sick, who need a doctor.

13. "But go and learn what this means, "It is mercy I desire, and not sacrifice; for I am come not to call just men, but sinners."

14. At that time the disciples of Johncame and asked him, "Why are we and the Pharisees always fasting, while your disciples are not?"

15. "Can the friends fast at a wedding-feast," said Jesus, "so long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom has been taken from them, and then they will fast.

16. "No one ever sews a piece of undressed cloth on an old cloak. If they did, the patch put on to fill it up would tear away from the cloak, and the rent be made worse.

17. "Nor do they put new wine into old wine-skins; if they did, the wine-  skins would split, the wine would run out, and the skins be ruined.  Instead, they put new wine into fresh wine-skins and both are preserved."

18. As he was saying these words to them, a ruler came up and knelt before him, saying. "My daughter has just died; but come, put your hand upon her, and she will live."

19. And Jesus rose and followed him, and so did his disciples.

20. But a woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind him, and touched the tassel of his cloak.

21. For she said to herself, "If only I can touch his cloak, I shall be cured."

22. But Jesus turned and saw her and said, "Be of good courage,  daughter, your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed from that hour.

23. Now when Jesus had come into the house of the ruler, and had seen the flute-players and the wailing crowd, he said,

24. "Leave the room, for the little girl is not dead, she is sleeping."  And they began laughing at him.

25. When, however, the crowd had been driven out, he went in and took her hand, and the little girl woke up.

26. And the report of this spread throughout that whole region.

27. And as he went on from thence two blind men followed Jesus, crying,  "Have pity on us, Son of David!"

28. And when he had gone indoors, they came to him. "Do you believe that I can do this?" asked Jesus. "Yes, Lord," they answered.

29. Then he touched their eyes, saying "According to your faith be it unto you," and their eyes were opened.

30. Jesus charged them sternly, saying, "See to it that you let no one know."

31. But they went and published his fame in that whole region.

32. And as they were departing a dumb demoniac was brought to him,

33. and when he had driven out the demon, the dumb spoke. The crowds were amazed, saying, "Never was such a thing seen in Israel!"

34. But the Pharisees kept saying, "It is in the power of the Prince of the demons that he is casting out demons."

35. And Jesus continued to go throughout all the cities and towns,  teaching in the synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and infirmity.

36. And when he saw the crowds he had compassion on them because they were distressed and fainting, like sheep without a shepherd.

37. And he said to his disciples. "The harvest is great, but the laborers are few;

38. "therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest to thrust forth laborers into his harvest field."

## Matthew 10

1. And when he had called his twelve disciples to him, he gave them power over evil spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every kind of disease and infirmity.

2. These are the names of the apostles (missionaries). First, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother; Jamesthe son of Zebedee,  and John, his brother;

3. Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew, the tax-gatherer;  James, the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname is Thaddeus;

4. Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot who betrayed him.

5. These men, the Twelve, Jesus sent forth, after giving them the following instructions. "Do not go among the Gentiles, or enter any Samaritan town,

6. "but rather be on your way to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

7. "As you go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.

8. "Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons.  Freely you have received, freely give.

9. "Take no gold or silver or coppers in your purses;

10. "not even a bag for the journey, or a change of clothes, or sandals,  or even a stick; for the worker is worth his rations.

11. "Into whatever city or town you enter, inquire for some worthy person there, and stay with him until you leave.

12. "When you enter the house, salute it;

13. "and if the house is worthy let your blessing sit upon it; but if it be unworthy, let your blessing return to you.

14. "And whoever will not receive you or listen to your words, as you go out from that house or that city, shake off the very dust from your feet.

15. "I tell you solemnly it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of Judgment than for that town.

16. "Behold, it is I who am sending you forth like sheep among wolves.  Be then as serpents and as guileless as doves.

17. "But beware of men! For they will give you up to the Sanhedrin, and flog you in their synagogues.

18. "And you will be taken before governors and kings for my sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.

19. "But whenever they apprehend you, do not be anxious about how you shall speak or what you shall say; for it will be given you in that very hour what to say.

20. "For it will not be you who is speaking, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.

21. "And brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child;  and children will rise up against their parents and put them to death.

22. "You will be hated by all men because of my name; and he who endures to the end shall be saved.

23. "But when they persecute you in one city, flee to the next. In solemn truth I tell you that you shall not have completed the cities of Israel, before the Son of man comes.

24. "A pupil is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his masters.

25. "It is enough for the pupil to fare like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they called the master of the house Beelzebub,  how much more, the members of his household.

26. "So do not fear them; for there is nothing concealed which shall not be revealed, nor anything secret which shall not become known.

27. "What I am telling you is in the darkness, do you speak in the light; and what is whispered in your ear, proclaim upon the housetops.

28. "Do not be afraid of those who kill the body, but cannot kill the soul; but fear rather him who can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.

29. "Are not two sparrows sold for a half-penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your father.

30. "The very hairs on your head are all numbered.

31. "Cease to be afraid! You are of greater value than many sparrows.

32. "Every one, then, who will confess me before men, I also will confess before my Father who is in heaven.

33. "But whoever disowns me before men, I also will disown before my Father who is in heaven.

34. "Do not suppose that I am come to bring peace on the earth; I am come not to bring peace, but a sword.

35. "For I came to set "a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;

36. "and a mans own household will be his enemies.

37. "He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;

38. "and he who does not take his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me.

39. "He who has saved his life shall lose it; and he who has lost his life for my sake shall find it.

40. "Whoever receives you is receiving me, and he who receives me is receiving Him who sent me.

41. "Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet, shall receive a prophets reward; and whoever receives a righteous man, shall receive a righteous mans reward.

42. "And whoever gives to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, because he is a disciple, I tell you in solemn truth, he shall not lose his reward.

## Matthew 11

1. After finishing his instructions to his twelve disciples, Jesus left that place, in order to teach and to preach in the neighboring cities.

2. But when Johnheard, in the prison, what the Christ was doing, he sent by some of his disciples to ask him,

3. "Are you the Coming One, or are we to look for someone else?"

4. "Go and tell John," was Jesus answer, "what you hear and see;

5. "the lame are walking, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf are hearing, the dead are being raised up, and the gospel is being preached to the poor.

6. "And blessed is the man who finds no cause of stumbling in me."

7. As these men started to go away, Jesus began to speak to the throngs, about John.

8. "What did you go out into the desert to behold?" he asked; "A reed shaken by the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, those who wear soft raiment dwell in kings  palaces!

9. "But why did you go? To see a prophet? I tell you, yes, and more than a prophet;

10. "for this is he of whom it is written. "Behold, I send my messenger before my face, And he will prepare thy road for thee.

11. "In solemn truth I tell you that there has not arisen among those born of women a greater than Johnthe Baptist; yet one of the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.

12. "From the days of Johnthe Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by storm.

13. "For the prophets and the Law prophesied until John;

14. "and, if you are willing to receive it, he is the Elijah who was to come.

15. "Let all who have ears, listen!

16. "To what shall I compare this generation? It is like little children sitting in the market-place, who call to the other children,

17. "saying. We have piped to you and you have not danced; We have wailed, but you have not beaten your breasts.

18. "For Johncame neither eating nor drinking, and they said, He has a demon;

19. and the Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Lo, a glutton and a wine-drinker, a friend of tax-gatherers and sinners!  Nevertheless, Wisdom is justified by her deeds."

20. Then he began to upbraid the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they had not repented.

21. "Woe unto you, Chorazin! Woe unto you, Bethsaida! Because if the mighty works which have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented, long ago, in sackcloth and ashes.

22. "Moreover, I tell you it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the Day of Judgment, than for you.

23. "And you too, Capernaum! Will you be exalted even to heaven? You shall go down to the Place of Death! For if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which have been done in you, it would have remained until this day.

24. "I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the Day of Judgment, than for you."

25. At that time Jesus answered and said. "I praise thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hidden these things from the wise and wary, and hast revealed them to the children.

26. "Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.

27. "Everything has been handed over to me by my Father; neither does any one know the Son, except the Father, nor any one know the Father except the Son, and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.

28. "Come unto me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.

29. "Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.

30. "For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."

## Matthew 12

1. At that time Jesus walked through the wheatfields one Sabbath Day;  and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck some ears of wheat and to eat them.

2. But the Pharisees, when they perceived it, said to him. "Look! Your disciples are doing what it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!"

3. "Have you not read," answered Jesus, "what David did when he was hungry, and his men, too?

4. "How he went into the House of God, and there they ate the loaves of the Presence, which neither he nor his men were permitted to eat, but the priests only?

5. "Have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the Temple break the Sabbath and are guiltless?

6. "But I tell you that One is here who is greater than the temple.

7. "And if you knew what this means, "It is mercy I desire, not sacrifice,

8. "you would not have condemned the guiltless. For the Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath."

9. As he passed along he went into their synagogue, and there he saw a man with a withered hand.

10. And in order to get a charge against him they asked him, "Is it permitted to heal on the Sabbath?" (So that they might have something to accuse him.)

11. "Is there a man of you," he replied, "who has but a single sheep,  who will not lay hold of it and lift it out, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath Day?

12. "And how much more is a man worth than a sheep? Therefore it is right to do good on the Sabbath."

13. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand."

14. The man stretched it out, and it had become sound like the other.  But when the Pharisees came out, they consulted together how they might destroy him.

15. So when Jesus knew it, he withdrew from that place, and numbers of people followed him.

16. He cured them all; but he strictly forbade them to blaze abroad his doings,

17. that the word spoken through Isaiah, the prophet, might be fulfilled.

18. Behold my servant whom I have chosen, My beloved, in whom my soul delights; I will breathe my spirit upon him, and he shall announce justice to the Gentiles

19. He will not strive nor cry aloud, Nor shall anyone hear is voice in the streets

20. The bruised reed will not break; The dimly burning wick will not quench; Till he has led justice on to victory.

21. And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.

22. Then they brought to him a blind and deaf demoniac; and he healed him, so that the dumb both spoke and saw.

23. And all the crowds were amazed, and he began to say, "Can this be the Son of David?"

24. When the Pharisees heard it they said, "It is only by the aid of Beelzebub, the Prince of the demons, that this fellow is driving out demons."

25. Because Jesus knew what was in their minds, he said to them. "Any kingdom divided against itself will become desolate; and any city or household divided against himself will not stand.

26. "So if Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?

27. "And if I am casting out demons in the power of Beelzebub, in whose power do your sons cast them out? So they themselves shall be your judges.

28. "But if it is in the power of the Spirit of God is already upon you.

29. "Or how can any one enter the strong mans house and carry off his goods without first binding the strong man? Then he can rob his house.

30. "He who is not with me is against me; and he who is not gathering with me, scatters.

31. "Therefore I tell you that every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven men; but the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven.

32. "And if any man say a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in this age or in that which is to come.

33. "Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for by its fruit the tree is known.

34. "You generation of vipers! How can you speak good, when you are evil? For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of. "When the time of fruit drew near, he sent his slaves to the vine-dressers seized to get his fruit.

35. "A good man out of his good treasure brings forth good; and from his evil treasure a bad man brings out evil.

36. "I tell you that for every careless word that men speak they shall give account on the day of judgment.

37. "For by your words you will each be justified, and by your words be condemned."

38. Then some of the Scribes and Pharisees accosted him. "Teacher," they said, "we want to see some sign from you."

39. In reply Jesus told them. "An evil and faithless generation seeks a sign, and no sign will be given them except the sign of the prophet Jonah.

40. "For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the sea-  monsters belly, so the Son of man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

41. "The men of Nineveh will stand up in the Judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented under the preaching of Jonah, and lo! a greater than Jonah is here!

42. "The Queen of the South will rise in the judgment with this generation, and condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon; and lo! a greater than Solomon is here!

43. "Whenever an unclean spirit leaves a man, it wanders through waterless places, seeking rest but finding none.

44. "Then it says, "I will go back to my house which I left;and on arrival finds it empty, swept, and garnished.

45. "Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits worse than itself; and they enter in and dwell there. And the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it be with this wicked generation."

46. While he was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers were standing outside, desiring to speak to him.

47. So some one told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, and wanting to speak to you."

48. But he answered the man who told him, "Who is my mother and who are my brothers?"

49. And stretching his hand toward his disciples, he said,

50. "Behold my mother and my brothers! For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven, is my brother and sister and mother."

## Matthew 13

1. On that same day, after Jesus had left the house, he took his seat on the seashore;

2. and such a great crowd gathered about him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the crowd stood on the beach.

3. Then he told them many truths in parables. "Behold," he said, "the sower went forth to sow;

4. and as he sowed, some seed fell by the roadside, and the birds came and ate it.

5. Some fell on rocky ground where there was not much earth. Now because it had no depth of soil, it sprang up at once;

6. but when the sun rose it was scorched, and withered away because it had no root.

7. Some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up and choked it.

8. But some fell on good soil, and bore a crop, some a hundredfold,  some sixty, some thirty.

9. He who has ears, let him hear!"

10. Now when his disciples came up to him, they said,

11. "Why do you speak to them in parables?" Jesus answered. "To you it has been granted to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; but to them it has not been granted.

12. "For whoever holds, to him shall more be given, and he shall have abundance; but whoever does not hold, from him shall be taken away even what he holds.

13. "This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.

14. And in them is being fulfilled that prophecy of Isaiah which says.  "Hearing you will hear and not understand; Seeing you will see and not perceive;

15. For the heart of his people is made fat, Their ears are dull of hearing; Their eyes, too, have they closed, Lest some day their eyes should perceive, And their ears should hear, And their heart should understand and turn, And I should heal them.

16. "But happy are your eyes, because they see, and your ears because they hear.

17. "In solemn truth I tell you that many prophets and holy men have seen it not, and to hear what you are hearing, and have not heard it.

18. "Listen then, to the parable of the sower.

19. "Whenever any one hears the message of the kingdom, and does not understand it, the Evil One comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart.

20. "This is the seed sown by the wayside. And the word, and at once receives it with joy.

21. "But he has no root in himself; he continues for a time, but when trouble arises, or persecutions, on account of the word, at once he stumbles and falls.

22. "And the seed sown among thorns is he who hears the word, but the anxieties of the age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word,  and it becomes unfruitful.

23. "But the seed sown in good soil is he who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit, and makes now an hundredfold,  now sixty, now thirty."

24. He told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like a man who sowed good seed in his field;

25. "but while men were asleep his enemy came and sowed tares among his wheat and went away.

26. "And when the blade shot up and formed the wheat-kernel, then the tares also appeared.

27. "The slaves of the owner went to him and said. "Was it not good seed, sir, that you sowed in your field? From whence then, do you get tares?

28. "It is an enemy who has done this, he answered. "The slaves said to him, Do you want us to go and collect them?

29. "No, he answered, for fear lest while you are collecting the tares, you at the same time pull up the wheat.

30. "Let both grow together until harvest, and at harvest-time I will tell the reapers to first gather the tares and tie them in bundles for burning, but to bring all the wheat into my store-house."

31. He set forth to them another parable, saying. "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard-seed which a man took and planted in his field.

32. "This is indeed the smallest of seeds, but when it is grown it is greater than any herb, and becomes a tree, so that the winged things of the sky come and roost in its branches."

33. He told them another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour,  until the whole was leavened."

34. Jesus told all this to the crowd in parables; indeed he never spoke to them except in parables,

35. in fulfilment of the word spoken by the prophet, I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things kept secret since the foundation of the world."

36. After he had sent the people away and gone into the house, his disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable about the weeds in the field."

37. "The sower of the seed," he answered, "is the Son of man;

38. "the field is the world; the good seed is the sons of the kingdom;  the weeds, the sons of the Evil One.

39. "The enemy who sows the weeds is the Devil. The harvest is the end of the age. The reapers are the angels.

40. "Just as the weeds are collected together and burnt with fire, so will it be at the end of the age.

41. "The son of man will send forth his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all hindrances, and whoever practises iniquity,

42. "and will throw them into the fiery furnace. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.

43. "And then shall the just shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let him who has ears to hear, listen!

44. "The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure buried in the ground,  which a man finds but buries again, and then in his joy goes and sells all that he has and buys that land.

45. "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of beautiful pearls.

46. "When he finds one of great price, he goes and sells everything he has and buys it.

47. "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and gathered fish of every kind.

48. "When it was full they hauled it upon the beach, and sat down and sorted the good fish into baskets, but threw the worthless fish away.

49. "So will it be at the end of the age. The angels will go forth and separate the wicked from the righteous, and fling them into the furnace of fire.

50. "There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.

51. "Have you understood all this?" he asked. "We have," they answered him.

52. "Then," said he, "every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his storehouse new things and old."

53. After Jesus had finished these parables, he withdrew from that place,

54. and came into his own country, where he continued teaching the people in their synagogues, until they were amazed. "Where did he get such wisdom?" they said, "and such wondrous powers?

55. "Is not this the carpenters son? Is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers Jamesand Joseph and Simon and Judas?

56. "Are not his sisters all living among us? Where, then, did he get all these powers?"

57. This kept them from believing in him. Wherefore Jesus said, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and among his own family."

58. And he did no mighty works there, because of their lack of faith.

## Matthew 14

1. Just then Herod, the Tetrarch, heard of Jesus fame, and said to his courtiers.

2. "This man is Johnthe Baptist; he is risen from the dead. That is why miraculous powers are working through him."

3. For Herod had apprehended John, shackled him, and thrust him into prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philips wife,

4. because Johnkept telling him, "It is not right for you to have her."

5. And although he wished to kill John, he feared the people, for they considered Johna prophet.

6. But when Herods birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company,

7. and so pleased Herod that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked for.

8. So, prompted by her mother, the girl said, "Give me at once, upon a dish, the head of Johnthe Baptist."

9. The king was displeased because of this, but because of his oaths and his guests he ordered it to be given her.

10. He sent and beheaded Johnin prison;

11. the head was brought on a dish, and given to the young girl, who took it to her mother.

12. Then Johns disciples went and removed his body, and came and told Jesus.

13. When Jesus heard it he went away privately by boat to a lonely spot;  but the crowds heard about it, and followed him on foot from the cities.

14. So when he landed he saw a great multitude, and felt compassion for them, and healed their sick.

15. As twilight fell, his disciples came to him and said. "This is a lonely spot, and the day is far spent; send the crowds away, so that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food."

16. "They need not go away," said Jesus, "do you, yourselves, give them something to eat."

17. "We have nothing here," they replied, "except five loaves and two fishes."

18. "Bring them here to me," said Jesus.

19. Then he told the people to sit down on the grass, and after taking the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then he broke the loaves and handed them to the disciples, and the disciples handed them to the crowds.

20. And they all ate and were fully satisfied, and they took up of the fragments that remained, twelve basketfuls.

21. Those who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.

22. Then he made his disciples get aboard the boat and precede him to the other side, while he sent away the crowds.

23. After he had sent the crowds away, he went up into the mountain alone, to pray. When night came he was there alone.

24. But the boat was already a long way from shore, buffeted by the waves, for the wind was contrary.

25. And in the fourth watch of the night he came toward them, walking upon the sea,

26. but when the disciples saw him walking upon the sea, they were terrified. "It is a phantom," they said, and cried out for fear.

27. But at once Jesus spoke to them, "Courage," he said, "it is I. Fear not."

28. Peter answered, "Master, if it is you, bid me come to you upon the water."

29. "Come," said Jesus. Then Peter got down from the boat and walked on the water to go to Jesus.

30. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and as he began to sink, he cried out, "Master, save me!"

31. At once Jesus stretched out his hand and caught hold of him, saying to him. "O little faith! What made you doubt?"

32. Then as they climbed into the boat the wind grew weary,

33. and the men in the boat fell upon their knees before him, saying,  "You are, indeed, the Son of God."

34. Then they crossed over and came to land at Gennesaret;

35. and when the men of that country recognized him, they sent into all the country round about, and brought to him all the sick,

36. and kept begging him to let them touch the tassel of his cloak - and all who touched were completely cured.

## Matthew 15

1. Then some Scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying,

2. "Why do your disciples keep transgressing the tradition of the elders by not washing their hands before eating?"

3. "And why do you also keep transgressing the command of God by your tradition?" he asked.

4. "For God said, Honor your father and mother, and, Let him who reviles father or mother be put to death;

5. but you say that whoever tells his father or mother, Whatever of mine might have been of service to you is dedicated to God,

6. is in no way bound to honor his father. Thus do you make void the word of God by your tradition!

7. Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy concerning you, saying.

8. This is a people that honors me with their lips, But their heart is far from me.

9. In vain do they worship me, While they teach doctrines that are the commands of men."

10. Then Jesus called the people to him and said.

11. "Listen, and pay attention. It is not what goes into a mans mouth that defiles him, but what comes out of it, that defiles the man."

12. Then his disciples came to him and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees were scandalized when they heard that saying?" He replied.

13. "Any plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.

14. "Let them alone. They are blind men leading the blind; and if one blind man leads another, both of them will fall into a ditch."

15. Then Peter said to Jesus, "Explain the parable to us."

16. He answered. "Are even you still without understanding?

17. "Do you not know how all that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is afterward evacuated;

18. while what comes out of the mouth comes from the heart - and that is what defiles a man.

19. For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murder, adultery,  unchastity, theft, perjury, slander.

20. These are the things that defile a man; to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man."

21. Jesus then left that place, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon.

22. Behold, there came to him a Canaanite woman of those parts. She wailed loudly, saying. "Pity me, Lord, thou Son of David! My daughter is possessed of an evil spirit."

23. But he answered her not a word. Then the disciples came up and kept beseeching him. "Send her away," they said, "because she wails after us."

24. In reply he said, "I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."

25. But the woman came and knelt to him and said, "Lord, do help me."

26. He answered, "It is not seemly to take the childrens bread and throw it to the little dogs."

27. "True, Lord," she said, "but even the little dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table."

28. Then Jesus answered her. "O woman, great is your faith. It shall be for you even as you desire." And from that hour her daughter was healed.

29. On leaving that place Jesus went along the shore of the Sea of Galilee; and after climbing a hill, took his seat there.

30. Great crowds came to him, bringing the crippled, the blind, the maimed, the dumb, and many others. They laid them at his feet and he healed them;

31. so that the crowd wondered when they saw the dumb speaking, the cripples walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.

32. But Jesus called his disciples to him and said. "My heart yearns over the crowd, for they have been with me now three days, and they have nothing to eat. I am not willing to send them away hungry, for fear they faint on the road."

33. "In a lonely place like this," asked the disciple. "where can we get bread enough to satisfy such a crowd?"

34. "How many loaves have you?" answered Jesus. They replied, "Seven,  and a few small fish.

35. So when he had summoned the crowd, and seated them upon the ground,

36. he took the seven loaves and the fish, and gave thanks, then he broke them and gave them to his disciples, and the disciples to the crowd.

37. And all ate and were satisfied, and of the fragments that remained they gathered seven large basketfuls.

38. And those who ate numbered four thousand, besides the women and children.

39. When he had sent the crowds away, he got into the boat and came into the region of Magadan.

## Matthew 16

1. Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came to him, and in order to test him, asked him to show them a sign from heaven.

2. In answer he said. "In the evening you say, It will be fine weather, for the sky is red as fire;

3. and at dawn you say, It will storm today, for the sky is red and lowering. You know how to discern the look of the sky, but the signs of the times you cannot read.

4. A wicked and faithless generation is seeking a sign, but no sign shall be given it but the sign of Jonah." So he left them and went away.

5. When his disciples reached the other side of the lake, they had forgotten to bring bread.

6. Presently Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees."

7. And they began discussing it among themselves, saying, "It is because we did not bring any bread."

8. When Jesus knew it he said. "Weaklings in faith! Why are you arguing among yourselves, because you have no bread?

9. "Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many large basketfuls you took up?

10. "Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many large basketfuls you took up?

11. "How is it that you do not perceive that I did not speak to you concerning bread? But beware off the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees!"

12. Then they realized that he had not told them to beware of the leaven, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

13. When Jesus came into the neighborhood of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of man is?"

14. They replied, "Some say Johnthe Baptist;others, however, say that He is Elijah;others, Jeremiah, or One of the Prophets."

15. "And who do you say that I am?" he asked them.

16. So Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."

17. "Blessed are you, Simon, Son of Jonah," said Jesus; "for flesh and blood have not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven!

18. "Moreover I say to you that you are Petros (a rock), and on this petra (rock) I will build my church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against her.

19. "I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose upon earth shall be loosed in the heavens."

20. Then he enjoined his disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.

21. After this Jesus the Christ began to show his disciples how he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things at the hands of the elders and chief priests and Scribes, and be put to death, and on the third day be raised again.

22. Then Peter took him aside and began to reprove him, saying. "God forbid, Master! That shall never befall you."

23. But he turned and said to Peter. "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling-block to me, because you are not intent on what pleases God, but what pleases men."

24. Then Jesus said to his disciples. "If any man wishes to come after me, let him renounce self, take up his cross, and follow me.

25. For he who wants to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.

26. What will it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?  or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

27. For the Son of man is about to come in the glory of his Father, and his angels with him, and then will he reward each one in accordance with his actions.

28. Solemnly I tell you, some of those who are standing here shall not taste death, till they have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom.

## Matthew 17

1. Six days later Jesus took with him Peter and Jamesand his brother John, and led them up a high mountain, by themselves apart.

2. Here he was transfigured before them; his face shone like the sun,  and his garments became as white as the light.

3. And behold! Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.

4. Then Peter said to Jesus. "Master, it is good that we are here! If you are willing I will make here three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."

5. While he was yet speaking, behold! a luminous cloud overshadowed them; and a voice out of the cloud, saying. "This is my Son, my Beloved, in whom is my delight. Listen to him."

6. When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were terrified.

7. But Jesus came to them and touched them, saying, "Rise, have no fear!"

8. And when they raised their eyes they saw no one save Jesus only.

9. While they were going down from the mountain, Jesus laid a command on them. "Speak to no man about the vision," he said, "until after the Son of man has been raised from the dead."

10. And his disciples asked him, saying, "Why then do the Scribes say that Elijah must first come?"

11. And he answered. "Elijah is coming, and will restore all things.

12. "Nay, I say to you that Elijah has come already, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they chose. Even so the Son of man also is about to suffer at their hands."

13. Then the disciples divined that he had been speaking to them about John, the Baptist.

14. As they reached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, and fell on his knees before him, saying.

15. "Master, take pity on my son, for he is an epileptic and sore distressed. Often he falls into the fire and often into the water.

16. "And I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him."

17. In reply Jesus said. "O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I endure you? Bring him here to me!"

18. Then Jesus rebuked the evil spirit, and it came out of him; and the boy was cured from that very hour.

19. Thereupon Jesus disciples came to him and asked him privately, "Why were we not able to cast it out?"

20. "Because of your little faith," he answered. "In solemn truth I tell you that if you have faith the size of a mustard-seed, you can say to this mountain, Move from this place to that! and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.

21. "But this kind is driven out by prayer alone."

22. As they continued going from place to place in Galilee, Jesus said to them. "The Son of man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men;

23. "and they will kill him, but on the third day he will rise again."  And they were greatly grieved.

24. As they came into Capernaum the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and asked, "Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?"

25. "Indeed he does," answered Peter. But on Peters entering the house,  Jesus forestalled him, saying. "How does it seem to you, Simon? From whom do earthly kings collect customs or taxes-from their own people,  or from aliens?"

26. And when he replied, "From aliens," Jesus said. "Then their people go free.

27. "Nevertheless, that we may not give offense, go to the seaside,  throw in your hook; take the first fish that rises, and when you have opened its mouth, you will find a shekel in it. Take it and give it to them for us both."

## Matthew 18

1. At that hour his disciples came to Jesus and asked him, "Who is really greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"

2. When he had called a little child to him, Jesus set him among them,  and answered.

3. "In solemn truth I tell you that unless you turn and become like little children, you will not even enter the kingdom of heaven.

4. "Whoever therefore will humble himself like this little child, is greatest in the kingdom of heaven;

5. "and whoever receives one such child for my sake, receives me.

6. "But whoever shall cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung about his neck, and he were drowned in the depths of the sea.

7. "Woe unto the world because of such stumbling-blocks! They will surely come, but woe unto each man by whom they come!

8. "If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled, than to keep both hands or both feet and be cast into the everlasting burning.

9. "If your eye keeps causing you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with only one eye,  than to keep both eyes and be cast into the Gehenna of fire.

10. "See to it that you never despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father in heaven.

11. "For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.

12. "How does it seem to you, when a man has a hundred sheep and loses one of them? Will he not leave the ninety and nine on the hills, to go and search for the one that has strayed?

13. "And if he succeeds in finding it, I tell you solemnly that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety and nine that never strayed away.

14. "Just so it is not the will of my Father in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.

15. "If your brother sins against you, go and show him, between yourself and him alone. If he listens, you have won your brother.

16. "But if he will not listen to you, take one or two others along, so that by the testimony of two or three witnesses every word may be established. If he will not listen to them, tell the church;

17. "but if he will not heed the church, let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax-gatherer.

18. "I tell you all in solemn truth that whatever you forbid upon earth will be forbidden in heaven, and whatever you permit on earth will be permitted in heaven.

19. "And again I tell you that if two of you on earth symphonize your praying concerning anything for which you have asked, it shall be done for you by my Father in heaven.

20. "For wherever there are two or three gathered together in my name,  there am I among them."

21. Just then Peter came to him, and asked him, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?"

22. "I do not tell you till seven times,"answered Jesus, "but till seventy times seven.

23. "Thus the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves.

24. "But when he began to settle, one of them was brought before him who owed him fifteen million dollars.

25. "And since he was unable to pay, his master ordered him to be sold,  and his wife and children and all that he had, toward the payment of the debt.

26. "Thereupon his slave threw himself on his knees before him, crying,  "Have patience with me, and I will pay you all!

27. "So then the master pitied his slave, and let him go, and forgave him his debt.

28. "But on his way out, that slave met a fellow slave who owed him fifty dollars. Seizing him by the throat, and nearly choking him, he exclaimed, "Pay me what you owe me!

29. "Then his fellow slave fell at his feet, and besought him, saying,  "Be patient with me, and I will pay you.

30. "But he would not; on the contrary he went and threw him into prison until he should pay the debt.

31. "When therefore his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were very angry; and they went and explained to their master all that had happened.

32. "Immediately his master summoned him and said. "You wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you implored me.

33. "Ought not you also to have had pity on your fellow slave, just as I had pity on you?

34. "Then in hot anger his master handed him over to the torturers,  until he should pay him all his debt.

35. "So will my heavenly Father do to you also, unless from your heart each one of you forgive his brother."

## Matthew 19

1. It came about after Jesus had finished these teachings, that he removed from Galilee, and went to that part of Judea which lay across the Jordan.

2. A great multitude followed him, and he healed them there.

3. Presently some of the Pharisees came up to him, and made test of him by asking, "Is it right for a man to divorce his wife for every cause?"

4. "Have you not read." he answered, "that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said,

5. "For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall be one flesh?

6. "Thus they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate."

7. They answered, "Why then did Moses command the husband to give her a written bill of divorce, and so to put her away?"

8. "Moses," said Jesus, "permitted you to divorce your wives on account of the hardness of your hearts, but from the beginning it was not so.

9. "And I tell you that any man who divorces his wife for any cause except her unfaithfulness, and marries another woman, commits adultery."

10. "If that is the position of a man in relation to his wife," answered the disciples, "it is better not to marry."

11. He answered them. "Not all are accepting this teaching, but only those to whom it has been granted.

12. "For there are eunuchs who have been such from birth; others who have been made such by men; and others who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of God. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it."

13. Then young children were brought to him, that he might lay his hands on them and pray. His disciples interfered, but Jesus said to them.

14. "Let the little children come to me, and forbid them not; for it is to the childlike that the kingdom of heaven belongs."

15. So he laid his hands upon them, and departed from that place.

16. But look! a certain man came up to him and asked, "Teacher, what good thing shall I do to inherit eternal life?"

17. "Why do you ask me about what is good?" asked Jesus. "There is but One who is good. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments."

18. "Which commandments?" asked the man. Jesus replied. "Thou shalt not kill; Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; Thou shalt not bear false witness;

19. "Honor thy father and thy mother; and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."

20. The young man answered. "I have carefully kept them all. What yet do I lack?"

21. "If you want to be perfect," said Jesus, "go, sell your property,  give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come,  follow me."

22. But when the young man heard this teaching, he went away sorrowful,  for he was one who had much property.

23. So Jesus said to his disciples. "In solemn truth I tell you that a rich man will find it difficult to enter the kingdom of heaven.

24. "I tell you again, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven."

25. When they heard this the disciples were utterly astounded. "Who then can be saved?" they exclaimed. Jesus looked at them.

26. "With men this is impossible," he said, "but with God all things are possible."

27. Whereupon Peter said to Jesus. "Look, Master, we have forsaken everything and followed you. Now what shall be our reward?"

28. "In solemn truth I tell you," Jesus answered, "that in the New Creation, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory,  you also who have followed me shall sit on twelve thrones, to govern the twelve tribes of Israel.

29. "And every one who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for my sake, shall many times as much, and fall heir to eternal life.

30. "But many who are first shall be last, and many who are last shall be first.

## Matthew 20

1. "For the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who went out at dawn to hire workmen for his vineyard.

2. "And when he had agreed with the workmen for two shillings a day, he sent them into his vineyard.

3. "About nine oclock he went out and noticed some other workmen standing idle in the market-place;

4. "and he said to them, "Do you also go into the vineyard, and whatever is just I will pay you.

5. "So they went. Again at noon, and about three oclock, he went out and did the same thing.

6. "When he went out about five oclock, he found others standing around, and said to them, "Why have you been standing here idle, all the day long?

7. "Because no one has hired us, they replied. "He said to them, Do you also go into the vineyard.

8. "And when evening came, the Lord of the vineyard said to his steward, "Call the workmen and pay them their wages, beginning with the last hired and ending with the first.

9. "When those came who had begun at five oclock, they received two shillings apiece;

10. "and when the first came they supposed that they would get more, but they also received each two shillings.

11. "And as they took it they began to grumble against the master of the house.

12. "Those last men, they said, have toiled only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the burning heat of the day.

13. "In reply he said to one of them. My friend, I am doing no wrong.  Did you not agree with me for two shillings?

14. "Take your wage and begone! I chose to give to this last man the same as to you.

15. "Have I not the right to do what I choose with my own property? Or is your eye evil because I am generous?

16. "So the last shall be first, and the first, last."

17. When Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem, he took the Twelve aside by themselves, and as they went he said to them.

18. "Look! We are on the way up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death,

19. "and hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified; and on the third day he will rise from the grave."

20. Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons,  kneeling down and begging a favor of him.

21. "What is it you wish?" he said. She answered, "Command that these my two sons may sit upon your right hand and your left in your kingdom."

22. "None of you indeed shall drink," he answered, "but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."

24. When the ten heard of this, they were indignant at the two brothers;

25. but Jesus called them to him and said. "You know how the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them.

26. "Not so shall it be among you. But whoever among you wishes to become great, shall be your minister,

27. "and whoever wishes to be first among you, shall be your slave;

28. "just as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life as a ransom for many."

29. Now as they were leaving Jericho a great crowd followed him.

30. And two blind men, sitting by the side of the road, heard that it was Jesus who was passing by, and cried out, "Have pity on us,  Master, Son of David!"

31. But the crowd checked them, to make them keep still. They cried out all the louder, saying, "Master, have pity on us, Son of David!"

32. Then Jesus stopped and called to them, "What do you want me to do for you?"

33. "Master," they answered, "let our eyes be opened."

34. Then Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and they saw at once, and followed him.

## Matthew 21

1. And when they approached Jerusalem, and had reached Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them.

2. "Go on into the village facing you, and at once you will find an ass tied, and her colt with her. Loose them and bring them to me.

3. "And if any one says anything to you, tell him, The Master needs them, and he will send them without delay."

4. This happened in fulfilment of the word spoken though the prophet.

5. Say to the daughter of Zion, "Behold thy King cometh to thee, Gentle and sitting upon an ass, And upon a colt, the fool of a beast of burden."

6. So the disciples went and did as Jesus told them;

7. they led back the ass and her colt, and placed their cloaks on them.

8. Then Jesus seated himself upon them, and most of the crowd kept spreading their cloaks on the road, and others began cutting branches off the trees, and spreading them in the road.

9. And the crowds who preceded and those who followed after him shouted again and again, "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed be he who is coming in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"

10. And as he came into Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred. "Who is this?" they said.

11. And the crowds answered, "This is the Prophet Jesus, from Nazareth,  in Galilee."

12. Then Jesus entered into the Temple courts, and cast out all who were buying and selling there, and overturned the tables of the money-  changers, and the seats of those who sold pigeons.

13. "It is written," he said, "My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a den of thieves."

14. Then the blind and the lame came to him in the Temple courts, and he healed them.

15. But when the chief priests and the Scribes saw the wonderful works he did, and the boys who were shouting in the Temple Courts and saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David!"

16. they asked him, "Do you hear what they are saying?" "Surely," said Jesus, "and have you never read, Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?"

17. So he left them and went outside the city, to Bethany, and spent the night there.

18. At dawn, when he was on his way back into the city, he was hungry;

19. and when he saw a solitary fig tree beside the road, he went to it,  but found nothing on it but leaves. And he said to it, "Let no man gather fruit from you forever." And at once the fig tree withered away.

20. When his disciples saw this, they were astonished. "How instantaneously," they said, "the fig tree withered!"

21. In reply Jesus said to them, "In solemn truth I tell you that if you have faith and never doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, Up, cast yourself into the sea! it shall be done;

22. "and everything that you ask for in your prayers you shall have, if you believe."

23. When he had entered the Temple courts, and was teaching, the high priests and elders of the people came to him and asked him, "By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?"

24. Jesus answered. "I also will put a question to you, which, if you tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.

25. Johns baptism, whence was it, from heaven or from man?" So they began debating about it among themselves.

26. "If we say, From heaven, he will ask us, Why then did you not believe him? But if we say, From men, we are afraid of the crowd,  for they all regard Johnas a prophet."

27. So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." He said to them, "Nor am I going to tell you in what authority I do these deeds.

28. "But give me your judgment. There was once a man who had two sons.  He went to the first and said to him, "Son, go work today in my vineyard!

29. "I will go, sir, he answered; yet he did not go.

30. "Then he went to the second, and said the same thing to him. "I will not, he answered; but afterward he changed his mind and went.

31. "Which of these two did the will of his father?" "The last," they replied. "I tell you truly," said Jesus, "that the tax-gatherers and harlots are going into the kingdom of heaven before you!

32. "For Johncame to you in the road of righteousness, and you did not give credence to him; but the tax-gatherers and the harlots gave credence to him. But you, although you saw this, did not even then change your minds and give credence to him.

33. "Listen to another parable. "A man who was a householder planted a vineyard, fenced it about, dug a wine vat in it, built a tower, then rented it to vine-dressers and went abroad.

35. "And the vine-dressers seized his slaves, flogged one, killed another, and stoned a third.

36. "Again he sent other slaves, a larger number than at first, and they treated them in the same way.

37. "And last he sent his son to them; Surely they will respect my son, he said.

38. "But when the vine-dressers saw his son, they said to themselves.  "This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and take his inheritance.

39. "So they took him and cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him.

40. "When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-dressers?"

41. "He will utterly destroy those wretches," they answered, "and will entrust his vineyard to other vine-dressers, who will pay back the fruits to him in their season."

42. "Have you never read in the Scriptures," Jesus answered, "how The stone that the builders rejected Has been made the corner-stone; This is the Lords doing, It is wonderful in our eyes?

43. "I tell you that for this reason the kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation that does produce the fruit of it.

44. "He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; but he upon whom it falls will be scattered as dust."

45. As they listened to his parables, the chief priests and the Pharisees recognized that he was speaking about them;

46. but although they longed to apprehend him, they were afraid of the crowds, because they held him to be a prophet.

## Matthew 22

1. Once more Jesus answered them in parables.

2. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "may be compared to a king who made a wedding-feast for his son.

3. "He sent out his slaves to summon the invited guests to the feast,  but they did not want to come.

4. "Again he sent out other slaves. Tell the invited guests, he said,  that my luncheon is now ready; my oxen and fat cattle are killed;  everything is ready; come to the wedding-feast.

5. "They, however, paid no attention, but went off, one to his own farm, another to his business;

6. "while the rest seized his slaves and maltreated and murdered them.

7. "Then the kings wrath was roused, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.

8. "Then he said to his slaves, "The wedding-feast indeed is ready,  but the invited guests were not worthy.

9. "So go out into the partings of the highways, and summon everybody you find there to the wedding-feast.

10. "So those slaves went out into the roads, and gathered together all whom they found, good or bad, and the banquet-hall was filled with the guests.

11. "Then the king came in to inspect his guests, and he discovered there a man who had not put on a wedding-garment. He said to him,

12. "Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding-garment? "The man was speechless.

13. "Bind him hand and foot, said the king to his officers, and cast him into the outer darkness; there will be the wailing and the gnashing of teeth.

14. "For there are many called, but few are chosen."

15. Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might ensnare him during conversation.

16. So they sent their disciples to him, with the Herodians. "Teacher,"  they said, "we know that you are honest, and that you are teaching the way of God in sincerity; and are not afraid of any one, for you do not court mens favor.

17. "Give us your advice, then. Is it allowable to pay taxes to Caesar,  or not?"

18. And Jesus, because he knew their malice, said.

19. "Hypocrites! Why are you tempting me? Show me the tribute money." So they brought him a shilling.

20. "Whose likeness and inscription is this?" he asked.

21. "Caesars," they answered. Then he said to them, "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesars, and unto God the things that are Gods."

22. When they heard this they were astonished, and left him and went away.

23. That very day there came to him some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection. and they questioned him.

24. "Master," they said, "Moses taught that if a man dies without issue,  his brother is to marry the widow, and raise up a family for his brother.

25. "Now there were of our number seven brothers; and the first married and died. As he had no children, he left his wife to his brother;

26. "In the same way the second also died, and the third, unto the seventh.

27. "Last of all the woman died.

28. "In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be? They all had her."

29. In answer Jesus said. "You err because you do not know the Scriptures, nor the power of God.

30. "For in the resurrection men do not marry, nor are women given in marriage, but they are like angels in heaven.

31. "But concerning the resurrection of the dead, did you never read what was spoken to you by God,

32. "I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."

33. And when the crowds heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.

34. As soon as the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered themselves together,

35. and one of them, a lawyer, tested him by asking a question.

36. "Master, which is the great commandment in the law?"

37. Jesus answered, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.

38. "This is the great and first commandment.

39. "The second, which is like it, is this, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.

40. "On those two commandments hang the whole law and the prophets."

41. Now while the Pharisees were together, Jesus put this question to them.

42. "What is your opinion concerning the Christ? Whose Son is he?"  "Davids," they answered.

43. "How then, "he said, "does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,

44. "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand Until I put thine enemies beneath thy feet?

45. "If David calls him Lord, how can he be his Son?"

46. No one could answer him a word, nor did any one dare from that day to ask him another question.

## Matthew 23

1. Then said Jesus to the crowds and to his disciples.

2. "The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses seat;

3. "therefore do and observe whatever they bid you; but do not do as they do, for they preach, but do not practise.

4. "For they bind heavy burdens and lay them on mens shoulders, but they themselves will not lift a finger to move them.

5. "For they do all their good deeds to be gazed on of men. They widen their phylacteries,

6. "and lengthen the tassels, and are fond of the best places at banquets, and the front seats in the synagogues.

7. "They enjoy salutations in the market-places, and to have men call them Rabbi.

8. "But you are not to be called Rabbi;for one is your Teacher, and you are all brothers;

9. "and call no one Father on earth, for One is your Father in heaven.

10. "And call no one Leader, because One is your leader, even the Christ.

11. "Whoever is great among you shall be your minister;

12. "whoever exalts himself shall be humbled, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted.

13. "But woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in mens faces; for you do not enter, yourselves,  nor do you permit those who are about to come in, to enter.

14. (Is wanting in the oldest manuscripts.)

15. "Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you scour sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is gained, you make him twofold more a son of hell than you are, yourselves.

16. "Woe unto you, blind guides, who say, If any one swears by the Sanctuary, it is nothing, but if any one swears by the gold of the Sanctuary, the oath is binding.

17. "You fools and blind; for which is greater, the gold, or the Sanctuary which hallows the gold?

18. "You say, too, that whoever swears by the offering that is upon it,  his oath is binding.

19. "You blind! Which is greater, the offering or the altar which hallows the offering?

20. "He then, who swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it;

21. "and he who swears by the Sanctuary swears by it and by Him who dwells therein;

22. "and he who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits thereon.

23. "Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and anise and cummin, and neglect the weightier matters of the Law -  justice and mercy and good faith; these latter you ought to have done, and not to have left the former undone.

24. "You blind guides! who strain out the gnat and swallow the camel!

25. "Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but within they are filled with extortion and excess.

26. "You blind Pharisees, first clean the inside of the cup and of the plate, so that the outside of it may be clean also.

27. "Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You are like white-  washed sepulchers. They look beautiful without, but within they are filled with dead mens bones and all rottenness.

28. "Just so you also outwardly appear to men, just, but within you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.

29. "Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You rebuild the tombs of the prophets, and adorn the monuments of the righteous, and say,

30. "If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been their comrades in the murder of the prophets.

31. "So you bear witness against yourselves, that you are the descendants of those who slew the prophets!

32. "Fill up then the measure of your fathers!

33. "You serpents! You vipers brood! How shall you escape the judgment of hell?

34. "For this cause, behold! I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify; some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and pursue from city to city;

35. "that upon your heads may come every drop of innocent blood spilt upon the earth, from the blood of Abel, the just, to the blood of Zechariah the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the Sanctuary and the altar.

36. "In solemn truth I tell you that all these things will come upon this generation.

37. "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, murdering the prophets, and stoning those who have been sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together, as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you would not!

38. "Behold, your house is left to you desolate!

39. "For I tell you that never shall you see me again until you say,  "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." "nor did they know until the deluge came and swept them away; so will be the coming of the Son of man.

## Matthew 24

1. Then Jesus left the Temple courts and was walking away, when his disciples came to point out to him the Temple buildings.

2. "You see all these buildings?" he answered them; "I tell you solemnly that there shall not be left here one stone upon another,  that shall not be torn down."

3. When he had seated himself on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?"

4. "Take care," Jesus answered, "that no one mislead you;

5. "for many will come in my name saying, I am the Christ, and will mislead many.

6. "And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see to it that you are not afraid. Such things must happen, but the end is not yet.

7. "Such things must happen, nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.

8. "All these things are the beginning of birth-pangs.

9. "Then they will deliver you up to suffer affliction, and will put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my names sake.

10. "And then many will stumble and fall, and will betray one another,  and hate one another.

11. "Many false prophets will rise up and mislead many;

12. "and because of the increase of iniquity the love of the majority will grow cold;

13. "but he who endures to the end will be saved.

14. "And this gospel of the kingdom shall be proclaimed throughout the whole inhabited earth, for a testimony to the Gentiles, and then will come the end.

15. "So when you see the Abomination of Desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place let the reader take note of this,

16. "then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains;

17. "let him who is upon the housetop not go down to get the things in his house,

18. "and the man in the field not turn back to get his cloak.

19. "Alas for thee women who are with child, and for the nursing mothers in those days!

20. "But pray that your flight may not be in the winter; nor on a Sabbath;

21. "for then shall be a time of great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never shall be again.

22. "And if these days had not been shortened, no flesh would have been saved; but for the elects sake these days will be cut short.

23. "If at that time any one should say to you, See, here is the Christ! or There he is! believe him not.

24. "For false christs and false prophets will arise, and will work great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if it were possible, the very elect.

25. "See, I have forewarned you! So if they say to you,

26. "See, He is in the desert, do not go out there. "See, He is in the inner room, do not believe it.

27. "For just as the lightning flashes from the east, and is seen even to the west; so will be the coming of the Son of man.

28. "Wherever the corpse lies, there will the vultures flock together.

29. "But immediately after the tribulation of those days, "The sun will be darkened, The moon will not shed her light, The stars will fall from the sky, And the powers of the heavens will be shaken.

30. "Then the signs of the Son of man will appear in the sky; and then all the tribes of the earth will lament, when they see the Son of man coming upon the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory.

31. "And he will send forth his angels with a great sound of a trumpet,  and they will gather his elect together from the four winds, from utmost heaven to utmost earth.

32. "Learn from the fig tree, her parable; when her branches are become soft, and put forth leaves, you know that summer is near;

33. "so you also, when you see these signs, know that He is near, at the very doors.

34. "I tell you in solemn truth, that the present generation shall not pass away till all these things happen.

35. "Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.

36. "But no one knows about that day and hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.

37. "And as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of man.

38. "For just as in the days before the deluge they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the very day when Noah entered the ark,

40. "At that time there will be two men in the field; one will be taken,  and one will be left.

41. "Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and the other left.

42. "Keep guard then, for you do not know the day on which your Master is coming.

43. "But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming, he would have been on his guard, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.

44. "Therefore you also must be ready, for in an hour when you do not expect him, the Son of man is coming.

45. "Who, then, is the faithful and prudent slave, to whom his master has entrusted his household, to give them their food in due season?

46. "Blessed is that slave whom his Master, when he comes, shall find so doing.

47. "In solemn truth I tell you that he will set him over all his property.

48. "But if, because he is a bad slave, he should say to himself, My Master is a long time in coming,

49. "and if he begins to beat his fellow slaves, and to eat or drink with the drunkards,

50. "on a day when he is not expecting him, and at an hour which he does not know, the Master of that servant will arrive

51. "and will scourge him severely, and allot him a place among hypocrites, where will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."

## Matthew 25

1. "Then will the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten maidens who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom and the bride.

2. "And five of them were foolish, and five were wise.

3. "The foolish took their lamps, but took no oil with them;

4. "but the wise took oil in their flasks with their lamps.

5. "Now because the bridegroom tarried, they all fell to nodding and went on sleeping.

6. "But at midnight there arose a cry, "Behold, the bridegroom! Go out to meet him!

7. "Then all those maidens rose and trimmed their lamps;

8. "and the foolish said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.

9. "Not so, answered the wise, for there may not be enough for you and for us. Go to the shops, rather, and buy some for yourselves.

10. "And while they were going away to buy, the bridegroom came; and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding-feast. And the door was shut.

11. "Afterwards the other maidens came and cried, "Lord, Lord, open unto us!

12. "In solemn truth I tell you, he replied, I know you not.

13. "Be watchful then, for you know neither the day nor the hour.

14. "For it is like a man going into another country, who summoned his slaves, and committed his property to their care.

15. "To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another, one -  to each according to his individual ability - and then set out on his travels.

16. "At once the man who had received the five talents went out and traded with them, and made five talents more.

17. "In the same way the one who got two talents made another two.

18. "But he who had received the one talent went off, and dug a hole in the ground, and hid his masters money.

19. "After a long time the master of those slaves came, and demanded a reckoning with them.

20. "The man who had received the five talents came, bringing five more,  and said. "Master, five talents you entrusted to me; see, I have gained five more.

21. "Well done, good and faithful slave, replied his master; You have been faithful over many things. Enter into your masters joy.

22. "The second, who had received the two talents, came up and said.  "Master, it was two talents that you entrusted to me; see, I have gained two more.

23. "Well done, good and faithful slave, his master replied, You have been faithful over many things; enter into your masters joy.

24. "Then the man who had received the one talent came up and said.  "Master, I knew you were a hard man, reaping where you had not sown,  and gathering where you had not scattered;

25. "so I was afraid; I went away and buried your talent in the earth.  There, you have what belongs to you!

26. "You wicked and lazy slave, said his master. You say you knew that I reap where I have not sowed, and gather where I have not scattered?

27. "Then you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back my property with interest.

28. "So take away the talent from him, and give it to the man who has ten talents.

29. "(For to every one who has, it shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but from him who has not shall be taken away even what he has.)

30. "But cast out the worthless slave into the outer darkness; there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.

31. "But when the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then will he take his seat on the throne of his glory;

32. "and all the nations will be gathered in his presence. And he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats;

33. "and he will place the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left.

34. "Then he, the King will say to those on his right hand. "Come, my Fathers blessed ones, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.

35. "For I was hungry, and you gave me food; I was thirsty, and you gave me drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in;

36. "I was naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you visited me; I was in prison, and you came to see me.

37. "Then shall the righteous answer him, saying. Master, when did we see you hungry and feed you; or thirsty and give you drink?

38. "When did we see you a stranger and take you in; or naked and clothe you?

39. "When did we see you sick or in prison, and come to see you?

40. "In solemn truth I tell you, the King will answer them, that inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these, my brothers, you have done it unto me.

41. "Then he will say to those also at his left hand. Depart from me,  accursed ones, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels;

42. "for I was hungry, and you gave me no food; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;

43. "I was a stranger, and you took me not in; naked, and you clothed me not; sick, or in prison, and you visited me not.

44. "Then will they also answer, Master, when did we ever see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison,  and did not minister to you?

45. "But he will reply, In solemn truth I tell you that inasmuch as you did not do it unto one of these least, you did not do it unto me.

46. "And these will go away into eternal punishment; but the righteous into eternal life."

## Matthew 26

1. Now it happened that after Jesus had finished all these discourses,  he said to his disciples,

2. "You know that the Passover is coming in two days, and the Son of man will be delivered up to be crucified."

3. Then the chief priests and the elders of the people met together in the court of the palace of the high priest who was called Caiaphas,

4. and they plotted together to get Jesus into their power by a trick,  and to put him to death;

5. but said they, "Not during the feast, for fear of causing a riot among the people."

6. While Jesus was staying in Bethany, in the house of Simon the Leper,

7. a woman came up to him who had an alabaster vase of very costly perfume, and poured it over his head, as he reclined at table.

8. when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, and exclaimed.

9. "Why is this waste? This perfume could have been sold for a good sum, and the money given to the poor."

10. But when Jesus understood it he said to them. "Why are you annoying the woman? This is a beautiful deed she has done for me;

11. "for the poor you have with you always, but me you will not always have.

12. "In pouring this perfume on my body, she was preparing me for my burial.

13. "In solemn truth I tell you that wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, what she has done shall be told about,  as her memorial."

14. It was then that one of the Twelve, he who was called Judas Iscariot,

15. went to the chief priests and said, "What are you ready to give me for betraying him to you?" So they weighed him thirty pieces of silver;

16. and from that time he kept looking for a chance to betray him.

17. On the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and said, "Where do you want us to make preparation for you eat the Passover?"

18. "Go into the city," he answered, "to a certain man, and tell him.  "The Teacher says. "My time is near. I am going to keep the Passover at your house, with my disciples.""

19. The disciples did as Jesus told them, and made ready the Passover.

20. When evening came he reclined at table with the Twelve;

21. and as they were eating, he said to them, "In solemn truth I tell you that one of you is going to betray me!"

22. In deep distress they began to ask him, each in turn, "It is not I,  is it, Master?"

23. In reply he said. "One who has dipped his hand with me in the dish will betray me.

24. "The Son of man is indeed to go as it is written concerning him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were good for that man if he had never been born."

25. In answer, Judas, who betrayed him, said, "Surely it is not I,  Rabbi?" He said to him, "Is it not?"

26. And as they were eating, Jesus took bread and, when he had blessed it, he broke it and gave to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat, this is my body."

27. And when he had taken the cup and given thanks, he gave it to them,  saying.

28. "Drink from it, all of you; for this is my blood of the Covenant,  which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.

29. "But I say to you, I will never again drink of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father."

30. So after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

31. Then Jesus said to them. "This very night even you will all stumble and fall away from me; for it is written, "I will smite the shepherd,  and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.

32. But after I am raised up I will go before you into Galilee."

33. "If they all stumble and fall away from you," answered Peter, "I will never do so!"

34. Jesus said to him, "In solemn truth I tell you that on this very night, before cockcrow, you will deny me three times!"

35. But Peter said to him, "Even if I must die with you, I will never deny you." And so said all the disciples.

36. Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, "Sit down here, while I go and pray yonder."

37. And he took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him, and began to be in anguish and sore distress,

38. and he said to them. "My soul is an anguish, even unto death! Stay here, and keep watch with me."

39. Then he went forward a short distance, and fell on his face and prayed. "O, my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me;  nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wit."

40. Then he came to his disciples, and found them asleep, and said to Peter. "So you were none of you strong enough to watch with me even one hour!

41. "Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."

42. Then he went away again a second time and prayed, saying, "O, my Father, if this cup cannot pass except I drink it, Thy will be done."

43. He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.

44. So he left them and went away again, and prayed the third time in the same words as before.

45. Then he came to the disciples and said. "Sleep on now, and take your rest. Look! the hour is at hand; the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of wicked men.

46. "Rouse yourselves! Let us go. My betrayer is close at hand!"

47. Barely had he spoken these words when Judas, one of the Twelve,  appeared, accompanied by a great crowd of men with swords and staves,  from the chief priests and elders of the people.

48. Now his betrayer had given them a sign, saying. "Whoever I kiss is the man; arrest him."

49. So he came straight up to Jesus and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him eagerly.

50. "Friend, do that for which you came," said Jesus. Then they came forward and laid hands on Jesus, and arrested him.

51. And, behold, one of these who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and smote the slave of the high priest, and cut off his ear.

52. Then Jesus said to him. "Put back your sword into its place! for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.

53. "Do you not suppose that I am able to appeal to my Father to furnish me at this very moment with twelve legions of angels?

54. "But if I did, how could the Scriptures be fulfilled that say that thus it must happen?"

55. Then Jesus said to the crowds. "Are you come out as against a robber, with swords and staves to arrest me? Day after day, I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not apprehend me.

56. "But all this has happened in order that the Scriptures might be fulfilled."

57. Then all his disciples forsook him and fled; but those who had apprehended Jesus led him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.

58. Now Peter was following him, afar off, as far as the courtyard of the high priest; and when he got in, he was sitting with the officers, to see the end.

59. And the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were trying to get false evidence against Jesus, in order that they might have him executed;

60. but they found none, although many false witnesses came forward.

61. However, at last two came forward who said, "This fellow declared,  I can destroy the Temple of God and build it in three days."

62. Rising to his feet the high priest asked Jesus. "Do you make no answer? What is it that these are testifying against you?"

63. But Jesus kept silence. Again the high priest addressed him, "I adjure you by the Living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God!"

64. "I am He," Jesus answered; "yet I tell you that from this time on you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming upon the clouds of heaven."

65. Then the high priest tore his garments, saying. "He has spoken blasphemy! What further need have we of witnesses? For behold, now you have heard his blasphemy!

66. "What is your verdict?" "He ought to die," they answered.

67. Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and some struck him with the palms of their hands, and cried.

68. "Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it who struck you?"

69. Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and one of the maidservants came up to him and said, "You also were with Jesus, the Galilean!"

70. But he denied it before them all; "I do not know what you mean," he said.

71. Soon afterward he went out into the porch, and another maid saw him,  and said to those who were there, "This fellow certainly was with Jesus, the Nazarene!"

72. And again he denied it with an oath, saying, "I never knew the man."

73. A little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "You also are certainly one of them, for your speech betrays you."

74. Then he began to curse and swear, saying, "I never knew the man."  Immediately the cock crew!

75. Then Peter recalled the word that Jesus had spoken, "Before the cock crow, you shall three times deny me" - and he went out and broke out into bitter weeping.

## Matthew 27

1. And when the morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, how they might put him to death.

2. After they had bound him, they led him away, and handed him over to Pilate, the Roman Governor.

3. Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that he was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.

4. "I have sinned," he said, "in betraying innocent blood!" "What is that to us?" they answered; "you must see to that."

5. And flinging down the silver into the Sanctuary, he rushed out, and went and hanged himself.

6. The chief priests took the money, and said, "It would be wrong to put it into the temple-treasury, because it is the price of blood."

7. So after the consultation they bought the Potters Field with it,  for a burial-place for strangers.

8. That is the reason why, to this day, the field is called "The Field of Blood."

9. Then was fulfilled the word spoken by the prophet Jeremiah. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who had been priced, whom certain of the Children of Israel had priced;

10. and gave them for the Potters Field, as the Lord had appointed me.

11. Now Jesus stood before the Governor, and the Governor questioned him. "Are you the King of the Jews?" he asked.

12. "it is as you say," answered Jesus; but while he was being accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.

13. Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear what they are testifying against you?"

14. But he made no answer, not even to one charge; insomuch that the Governor was greatly astonished.

15. Now it was the Governors custom, during the Passover, to release to the people any one prisoner whom they selected.

16. At that time they had a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.

17. So when they had assembled, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"

18. He knew well that it was because of enmity that they had brought Jesus before him.

19. And while he was seated upon the judgment-seat, his wife had sent to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered many things today, in a dream, because of him."

20. But the chief priests and the elders urged the crowds to ask for Barabbas, and to destroy Jesus.

21. So when Pilate said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release unto you?" they said, "Barabbas."

22. And Pilate asked, "What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ?" What one voice they shouted, "Let him be crucified!"

23. But Pilate said, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they kept shouting the more fiercely, "Let him be crucified!"

24. So when Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but that on the contrary a riot was threatening, he took water and washed his hands in the presence of the crowd, saying. "I am innocent of the blood of this man; you must answer for it."

25. All the people answered, "His blood be upon us and upon our children."

26. Then he released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he scourged, and delivered to be crucified.

27. Then the soldiers of the Governor took Jesus into the Praetorium,  and gathered all the battalion together.

28. They stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe.

29. And they twisted a thorny crown for him, and put it on his head, and placed a reed in his right hand. Then they knelt before him, in mockery, crying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"

30. And they spit upon him, and took the reed and struck him on the head, again and again.

31. At last, when they had finished their mocking, they took the robe off, and put his own garments on him, and led him away to crucify him.

32. And as they went out they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, whom they compelled to go with them to carry his cross.

33. And when they came to a place called Golgotha (the word means "Place of a Skull"),

34. they gave Jesus wine to drink, mingled with gall. But after tasting it he refused to drink it.

35. After crucifying him, they parted his garments among them by casting lots.

36. Then they sat and watched him there.

37. They also placed above his head his accusation written, This is Jesus The King of the Jews

38. At that time two robbers, also, were crucified with him; one on his right hand, the other on his left.

39. Those who passed by reviled him, wagging their heads saying.

40. "You who were going to destroy the Temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"

41. In like manner the chief priests, too, with the Scribes and elders,  kept taunting him.

42. "He saved other," they said, "himself he cannot save. He, the King of Israel! Let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him!

43. He put his trust in God. let Him deliver him now, if He cares for him. For he said, I am the Son of God!"

44. In the same way the robbers also who were being crucified with him,  dept reviling him.

45. Now from noon darkness fell upon the whole land, until three oclock in the afternoon.

46. But at three oclock Jesus cried out in loud voice, "Eli, Eli, Lama Sabachthani?" (That is to say, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?")

47. When they heard this, some of the bystanders said "He is calling for Elijah!"

48. At once, one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filling it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.

49. But the rest said. "Let be! Let us see whether Elijah is coming to save him!"

50. And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.

51. And lo, the veil of the sanctuary was torn in two, from the top to the bottom;

52. the earth quaked; the rocks split; the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.

53. And coming forth out of the tombs, after his resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many.

54. When the Roman captain and the soldiers who were with him, guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and all that happened, they were greatly terrified and said, "Certainly this man must have been Gods Son."

55. And there were present several women who were looking on from a distance; they had followed Jesus from a Galilee, ministering to him.

56. among them being Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jamesand Joses,  and the mother of Zebedees sons.

57. When it was eventide, there came a rich man of Arimathea, named Josephus, who was himself a disciple of Jesus.

58. This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.

59. Pilate then commanded that it be given over to him.

60. So Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock; and after rolling a great stone against the opening of the tomb, he went away.

61. And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.

62. The day after - that is, the day following the Preparation - the chief priests and Pharisees went in a body to Pilate and said.

63. "We recollect, Sir, that when he was living this imposter said, I will rise again after three days.

64. Now therefore give order to have the sepulcher securely guarded until the third day, for fear his disciples may come and steal him away, and then tell the people, He is risen from the dead;and so the last error will be worse than the first."

65. "You can have a guard," said Pilate. "Go your way, make it as secure as you can."

66. So they went and made the sepulcher secure, by sealing the stone in the presence of the guard.

## Matthew 28

1. At the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came down to see the sepulcher, when lo!

2. There had been a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord had come down from heaven, and gone and rolled away the stone, and was sitting upon it.

3. His appearance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow.

4. The guards trembled for fear of him, and became like dead men.

5. But to the women the angel said. "You need have no fear, for I know that you are seeking Jesus, the Crucified One.

6. He is not here; for he is risen, even as he said. Come, see the place where the Master was lying!

7. And go quickly and tell his disciples. He is risen from the dead;  he goes before you into Galilee; you will see him there. Remember, I have told you."

8. On this they ran quickly from the sepulcher, in fear and great joy,  to tell the news to his disciples.

9. And behold! Jesus himself met them, saying, "All hail!" And they went up to him and clasped his feet and worshiped him.

10. Then Jesus said to them. "Fear not! Go tell my brothers to depart into Galilee, and they will see men there."

11. Now while they were on their way, some of the guard went into the city and told the high priest all that had happened.

12. And when they had met with the elders and conferred together, they heavily bribed the soldiers and told them to say,

13. "His disciples came by night and stole him away, while we were asleep."

14. "If this should reach the Governors ears," they said, "we will satisfy him and screen you from punishment."

15. So the soldiers took the money, and did as they were told; and this story has been noised abroad among the Jews, and continues to this day.

16. But the eleven disciples went away to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.

17. And when they saw him they worshiped him; but some doubted.

18. And Jesus came forward to them and spoke to them, saying. "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.

19. Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;

20. teaching them to observe every command which I have given you. and lo! I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world."
