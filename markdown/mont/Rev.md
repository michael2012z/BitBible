# Revelation

## Revelation 1

1. \ul1 THE UNVEILING APOCALYPSE OF JESUS CHRIST\ul0  which God gave him to show to his slaves the things which must soon come to pass; and he sent and made it known by his angel to his slave John.

2. He bore witness of the Word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, even of all the things that he saw.

3. Blessed is he who reads, and they who hear the words of the prophecy, and keep what is written in it. \ul1 FOR THE CRISIS IS AT HAND\ul0 .

4. From John to the seven churches that are in Asia the Roman Province. Grace to you, and peace from Him that is and was and is to be, and from the Seven Spirits that are before his throne,

5. and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and has loosed us from our sins in his own blood;

6. and has made us to be a kingdom of priests unto his God and Father;  to him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever, Amen.

7. Behold, he is about to come among the clouds; and every eye will see him, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over him. So shall it be, Amen.

8. "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.

9. I, John, who am your brother and who share with you in the woes and kingdom and stedfastness of Jesus, found myself in the island called Patmos, for the sake of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.

10. I was in the Spirit on the Lords day, and I heard a loud voice behind me, like a trumpet,

11. saying, "Write in a book what you see, and send it to the seven churches; to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and Sardis and Philadelphia and Laodicea."

12. And I turned to see the Voice which was speaking to me, and as I turned I saw seven golden candlesticks;

13. and in the midst of the candlesticks One like to a son of man,  clothed with a robe down to the feet, and with a golden girdle round his breast.

14. His head and his hair were as white as wool, as white as snow; his eyes were like a flame of fire,

15. and his feet like burnished brass, as if molten in a furnace; and his voice like the voice of many waters.

16. In his right hand he held seven stars; and out of mouth went a sharp, two-edged sword, and his face was as the sun shining in his strength.

17. When I saw him, I fell at his feet as one dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying. "Fear not; I am the first and the last,  and the Living One.

18. I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore; and hold the keys of death and of Hades.

19. So write the things which you saw, and the things which are, and the things that will come to pass hereafter.

20. The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks, is this. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven candlesticks are the seven churches."

## Revelation 2

1. To the angel of the Church in Ephesus, write. These are the words of Him who holds the seven stars in his right hand, and who walks among the seven golden candlesticks.

2. I know your works and your toil and stedfastness, and that you cannot endure evil men, and that you tested those who called themselves apostles, though they are not, and how you found them false.

3. You are holding fast, and have borne up for my namess sake, and have not grown weary.

4. But I have this against you, that you have left your first love.

5. Remember whence you have fallen, and turn again, and do your first works. Otherwise I am coming to you and will remove your candlestick out of its place, unless you repent.

6. But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I hate.

7. He who has an ear, let him listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To him that overcomes, to him will I give to eat from the tree of life which is in the garden of God.

8. And unto the angel of the Church in Smyrna, write. These are the words of the First and the Last, he who died and has returned to life.

9. I know your persecution and your poverty - but you are rich! I know the reviling of those who say that they themselves are Jews, when they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.

10. Fear not what you are about to suffer! Behold, the devil is indeed going to put some of you in prison, that you may be tested, and you will have persecution for ten days. Be faithful even unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.

11. Let him who has ears, listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. He that overcomes shall not be hurt of the second death.

12. And to the angel of the Church in Pergamum, write These are the words of Him who holds the sharp two-edged sword.

13. I know where you dwell, where the throne of Satan is; and yet you are holding fast my name, and you have not denied my faith, even in the days of Antipas, my witness, my faithful one, who was slain among you, where Satan has his dwelling.

14. But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling-  block before the sons of Israel, to eat food offered to idols, and to practise immorality.

15. So you have also some who hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans.

16. Repent; if you do not I will very soon come to you, and will make war upon them with the sword of my mouth.

17. He who has ears, let him listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To him that overcomes I will give of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written,  which no man knows, but he that receives it.

18. And to the angel of the Church in Thyatira, write. These are the words of the Son of God, who has his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet like burnished brass.

19. I know your works and your love and faith and service and endurance;  I know that your last works are more than the first.

20. But I have this against you, that you are tolerating that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she is teaching and leading my slaves astray, leading them to practise immorality, and to eat food which has been sacrificed to idols.

21. I have given her time for repentance; but she is determined not to turn from her immorality.

22. Behold, I will lay her on a sick bed, and bring great distress upon those who have committed adultery with her, unless they turn away from her works.

23. And moreover, her children will I kill with pestilence. And all the churches shall know that I am he who searches the hearts and souls of men. I will give to each of you according to his works.

24. But to the rest of you in Thyatira, those who do not hold his teaching, and who do not know the "deep things" of Satan (as they call them),

25. I say that I am imposing upon you no fresh burden; only hold fast what you have till I come.

26. To him that overcomes and perseveres in my works to the end, will I give authority over the nations.

27. And he shall shepherd them with a rod of iron, shattering them like earthen vessels (as I myself have received from my Father),

28. and I will give him the Morning Star."

29. Let him who has an ear, listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.

## Revelation 3

1. To the angel of the Church at Sardis, write. These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your works, that you have the name of being alive, but are really dead.

2. Be continually on the watch, and establish the things that remain,  which were ready to die. For I have not found your works perfected before my God.

3. Call to mind, then, what you have received and heard, and hold to it, and repent. Unless you are on the watch, I will come as a thief,  and you will never know at what hour I am coming upon you.

4. Yet you have a few names in Sardis that have not defiled their garment; and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.

5. He who overcomes shall thus be clad in white raiment; and I will in no wise blot out his name from the book of life, and I will own his name before my Father, and before his angels.

6. Let him who has an ear, listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.

7. Write also to the angel of the Church in Philadelphia. These things says He who is holy, he who is true, he who has the key of David, he who opens, and no one shall shut; and who shuts, and no one opens.

8. I know your works. Lo, I have set before you an open door, which none can shut; for though you have only a little strength, you have kept my word, and have not denied my name.

9. Behold, I am making those of the synagogue of Satan, those who say they are Jews, but are not, but are lying; behold, I will make them to come and bow in reverence before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.

10. Because you have kept the word of my patience, I also will keep you from that hour of trial which is about to come upon the whole inhabited earth, to test those who dwell on the earth.

11. I am coming quickly. Hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown.

12. He that overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God;  and he shall go out from it nevermore. And I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down from my God out of heaven, and my own new name.

13. He that has an ear, let him listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.

14. To the angel of the Church in Laodicea, write. These things says the Amen, the witness, faithful and true, the beginning of the creation of God.

15. I know your works, that you are neither hot nor cold.

16. Would that you were either cold or hot. So because you are lukewarm,  and neither hot nor cold, I am about to spew you out of my mouth.

17. For you keep saying, "I am rich, and have become wealthy, and have need of nothing," and do not know that you are the wretched one, and pitiable and beggared and blind and naked.

18. I advise you to buy of me gold refined by fire, that you may become rich; and white raiment to clothe yourself, so that the shame of your nakedness may not be made manifest; and eye-salve to anoint your eyes, in order that you may see.

19. All whom I love I reprove and discipline; therefore be full of zeal and repent.

20. Behold, I am standing at the door and knocking! If any one listens to my voice, and opens the door, I will come to him, and sup with him, and he with me.

21. To him who overcomes, I will grant to sit down with me on my throne,  as I myself have overcome and have taken my seat with my Father on his throne.

22. Let any one who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.

## Revelation 4

1. After this, in my vision, I saw a door opened in heaven! And the first voice that I heard speaking with me was like a trumpet, saying,  "Come up hither, and I will show you the things that must come to pass hereafter."

2. Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, there stood a throne in heaven, and upon the throne One sat;

3. and he who sat was in appearance like a jasper stone and a sardius;  and there was a rainbow round about the throne, like an emerald to look upon.

4. And round about the throne were four and twenty Elders seated, who were clothed in white raiment, with golden crowns upon their heads.

5. From the throne issued lightning and voices and thunders. Seven blazing lamps were burning before the throne; these are the seven Spirits of God.

6. And in front of the throne as it seemed, a glassy sea like crystal;  and in the midst of the throne and encircling it are four Living Creatures, full of eyes before and behind.

7. The first creature was like a lion, and the second like a calf, and the third creature had a face like a mans, and the fourth creature was like an eagle flying.

8. And the four Living Creatures, each one with six wings, are full of eyes round about and within; day and night they are chanting ceaselessly. "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty. Who was, and who is, and who is to come."

9. And whenever the Living Creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever,

10. the four and twenty Elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne, and worship Him who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying.

11. "Worthy art thou, our Lord and our God, To receive the glory and the honor and the power; For thou didst create all things, And because of thy will they came into being And were created."

## Revelation 5

1. Then I saw lying upon the right hand of Him who sat upon the throne,  a book written within and on the back, close sealed with seven seals.

2. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose its seals."

3. And no one in the heavens or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look into it.

4. so I began to weep bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look into it.

5. But one of the Elders said to me. "Do not weep! Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, and so can open the book with its seven seals."

6. Then I beheld a Lamb standing as if slain in the midst of the throne and of the four Living Creatures, and in the midst of the Elders. He had seven horns and seven eyes (which are the seven Spirits of God,  sent forth into all the earth).

7. And he went, and now he has taken the book out of the right hand of Him who was seated on the throne.

8. When he took the book, the four Living Creatures and the four and twenty Elders fell down before the Lamb. And each had a harp and a golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.

9. And they sang a new song, saying, "Worthy art thou to take the book And to open its seals; For thou wast slain and didst ransom for God Men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation;

10. Thou hast made them kings and priests unto our God, And they shall reign on earth."

11. Then I looked and heard a voice of many angels encircling the throne and a voice of the Living Creatures and of the Elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,

12. singing aloud, "Worthy is the Lamb who has been slain, To receive power and riches and wisdom And might and honor and glory and blessing."

13. And I heard every created thing that is in heaven, or on earth, or beneath the earth, or on the sea, and all things that are in them,  saying, "To him who sits on the throne, And to the Lamb, Be the blessing and the honor, And the glory and the power, Forever and ever!"

14. And the four Living Creatures kept saying, "Amen!" And the Elders fell down and worshiped.

## Revelation 6

1. And I saw, when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four Living Creatures say, with a voice like thunder,  "Come!"

2. And I saw, and lo, a white horse, and he who sat on him had a bow;  and there was given him a crown; and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.

3. And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second Living Creature say, "Come!"

4. And another horse come forth, a red horse. To him who sat on it, it was allowed to take peace from the earth, and to cause men to kill one another; and a great sword was given to him.

5. And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third Living Creature say, "Come!" And I saw, and lo, a black horse! He who sat on him had a balance in his hand.

6. And I heard the semblance of a voice in the midst of the four Living Creatures, saying. "A quart of wheat for a shilling, and three quarts of barley for a shilling; but do not harm the oil and the wine."

7. And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth Living Creature calling, "Come!"

8. So I liked, and lo, a pale horse; and he who sat on him was named Death; and Hades was following after him. To them was given authority over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with the sword, and with famine, and with death, and with the wild beasts of the earth.

9. And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they bore.

10. And with a loud voice they cried, saying, "O Master, holy and true,  How long dost thou not judge And avenge our blood On those who dwell on the earth?"

11. And there was given to each one of them a white robe; and they were told that they should rest for yet a little time, until the number should be completed by their fellow slaves and their brethren who were about to be put to death as they had been.

12. And I looked when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black, like sackcloth, and the full moon became like blood;

13. and the stars of the sky fell to earth, as a fig tree shaken by a gale drops its unripe figs.

14. And the sky parted asunder like a rolled-up scroll; and every mountain and island was moved out of its place;

15. and the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the generals, the rich and the mighty, both slaves and freemen, every one of them hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains.

16. And they began to say to the mountains and to the rocks. "Fall upon us and hide us From the face of him who is seated upon the throne,  And from the wrath of the Lamb;

17. For the Great Day of their wrath has come, And who is able to stand?"

## Revelation 7

1. After this I saw four angels, standing at the four corners of the earth, restraining the four winds from blowing on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.

2. And I saw another angel ascend from the sunrising, having a seal of the living God; and he cried with a great voice to the four angels to whom it was given to injure the earth and the sea,

3. saying, "Do no harm to the earth, or the sea, or the trees, Until we have sealed the slaves of our God on their foreheads."

4. And I heard the number of those who were sealed, a hundred and forty and four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel.

5. Of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand were sealed; Of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand;

6. Of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Naphtali,  twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand;

7. Of the tribe of Symeon, twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Levi,  twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand;

8. Of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Joseph,  twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand;

9. After this I looked, and behold a great multitude, whom no man could number, out of every nation and tribe and people and tongue, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands;

10. and they cried with a loud voice, saying "Salvation to our God, who sits on the throne, And to the Lamb!"

11. And all the angels stood encircling the throne, and the Elders and the Living Creatures; and they fell on their faces before the throne,  worshiping God,

12. and crying, "Even so! The blessing and the glory and the wisdom And the thanksgiving and the honor and the power and the might Be to our God forever and ever. Amen."

13. And one of the Elders spoke to me, saying. "Who are these, clad in white robes? Whence come they?"

14. And I said to him, "You know, my Lord." And he said to me, "These are those who have come out of the great persecution, and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

15. For this they are now before the throne of God, and are serving him day and night in his temple. "And He who sits on the throne Will spread his tabernacle over them.

16. They hunger no more, Neither thirst any more; Neither will the sun strike upon them, Nor any scorching heat;

17. For the Lamb in the midst of the throne Will shepherd them, And will lead them to fountains of living water; And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."

## Revelation 8

1. And when he opened the seventh seal, there followed a silence in heaven, about the space of half an hour.

2. And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given them.

3. And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and a great quantity of incense was given him to mingle with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar, which was before the throne.

4. And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose up from the hand of the angel into the presence of God.

5. Then the angel took the censer, and he filled it with fire from the altar, and poured it upon the earth; and there followed thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake.

6. And the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to blow their trumpets.

7. And the first angel blew his trumpet, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and it fell upon the earth; and the third part of the earth was burned up, and the third part of the trees, and all the green grass.

8. And the second angel blew his trumpet, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the sea; and a third part of the sea became blood;

9. and a third part of the living creatures in the sea died, and the third part of the ships were destroyed.

10. And the third angel blew his trumpet, and there fell from heaven a great star, blazing like a torch. It fell upon a third of the rivers and upon the springs. (The name of the star is called Wormwood.)

11. A third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.

12. And the fourth angel blew his trumpet, and the third part of the sun was blasted, and a third part of the moon, and a third part of the stars; so that the third part of them should be darkened, and for a third part of the day there was no light, and at night it was the same.

13. And I looked and I heard a solitary eagle flying in mid-heaven, and crying with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe for all who live on the earth, Because of the rest of the trumpet-blasts That the three angels are about to blow!"

## Revelation 9

1. Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star fallen from heaven upon the earth; and to him was given the key to the bottomless pit.

2. And he opened the bottomless pit, and out of the pit there went up a smoke like the smoke of a great furnace. And the sun and the air grew dark, because of the smoke out of the pit.

3. And out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth; they were given power like that of scorpions on the earth..

4. They were told not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any plant,  nor any tree, but only those who have not the seal of God on their foreheads.

5. Yet they were not permitted to kill them, but only to torture them for five months. Their torture was like the torture of a scorpion,  when it stings a man.

6. In those days men will seek death, and will not find it; they will long to die, but death ever flees from them.

7. The appearance of the locusts was like horses equipped for battle.  On their heads there was something like crowns of gold, and their faces were like mens faces,

8. and they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like lions teeth,

9. and they had breastplates something like breastplates of iron; and the noise of their wings was like the noise of chariots, of many horses rushing into battle.

10. And they have tails like scorpions, and stings, and their power to torture men five months was in their tails.

11. They have a king over them, the angel of the bottomless pit. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon; in Greek he is called Apollyon.

12. "The first woe has passed; and still there are two woes to follow."

13. Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet; and I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God,

14. one saying to the sixth angel that had the trumpet, "Loose the four angels which are bound at the great river Euphrates."

15. Then the four angels that were held in readiness for that hour and day and month and year, were let loose, to destroy a third of mankind.

16. The number of the hosts of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand. I heard their number;

17. and thus I saw the horses in the vision and their riders. They had breastplates of fire, "red as fire, dark blue as jacinth, and yellow as sulphur." The heads of the horses were like lions heads, and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.

18. By these three plagues a third of mankind were killed; by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which issued from their mouths.

19. For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails.  For their tails are like serpents with heads, and with them they work woe.

20. And the rest of mankind who were not killed with these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands. They would not give up the worship of demons and of idols made of gold and silver, and brass,  and stone, and wood, which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk.

21. And they did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries,  nor of their immorality, nor of their thefts.

## Revelation 10

1. And I saw another mighty angel coming down out of heaven, clad with a cloud; and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.

2. In his hand he had a little book, open; and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the land.

3. With a great voice he shouted as a lion roars; and when he shouted,  the seven thunders uttered their voices.

4. When the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write;  but I heard a voice from the sky, saying, "Seal up the words which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not."

5. And the angel whom I had seen standing upon the sea and upon the land lifted up his right hand to heaven,

6. and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created the heaven and all that is in it, and the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it,

7. "Delay there shall be no more, but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to blow his trumpet, then shall there be finished the mystery of God, according to the Good News which he told unto his slaves, the prophets."

8. And the voice which I had heard from heaven, I heard again, speaking to me, and saying, "Go, take the little book that is open in the hand of the angel who stands upon the sea and upon the land."

9. And I went to the angel and told him to give me the little book. And he said to me. "Take it, and eat it up; it will make your belly bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey."

10. I took the little book out of the hand of the angel, and ate it up,  and it was in my mouth sweet like honey; but when I had eaten it, my belly was made bitter.

11. Then I was told, "You must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings."

## Revelation 11

1. And there was given me a reed like to a rod, and a voice said to me.  "Go and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those who are worshiping therein.

2. But the court which is outside the temple, omit, and do not measure that, for it has been given up to the Gentiles, and they shall tread under foot the Holy City for forty and two months.

3. And I will give power to my two witnesses, and clothed in sackcloth they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days.

4. "These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.

5. When any one wishes to hurt them, fire comes from their mouth and devours their enemies; and if any man wishes to hurt them, in this manner he must be killed.

6. These have power to shut heaven so that it does not rain in the days of their prophecy; and have power over waters to turn them to blood,  and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.

7. "And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that is coming up out of the bottomless pit will make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them.

8. And their dead bodies lie in the streets of the great city whose mystical name is Sodom and Egypt - where also their Lord was crucified.

9. For three days and a half men of all peoples, and tribes, and languages, and nations, look upon their dead bodies, and refuse to let their dead bodies be laid in a tomb.

10. "And those who dwell on the earth are rejoicing over them, and making merry; and they will send gifts to one another; because these two prophets were a torment to those who dwell on the earth.

11. And after three days and a half the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet, and great fear fell upon them.

12. And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, "Come up hither," and they went up to heaven on a cloud, while their enemies watched them.

13. And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and there were killed in the earthquake seven thousand persons; and the rest were frightened and gave glory to the God of heaven.

14. "The second woe is passed; and there is a third woe soon to follow."

15. And the seventh angel blew his trumpet; and there followed great voices in heaven, and they said, "THE KINGDOMS OF THIS WORLD ARE BECOME THE KINGDOM OF OUR LORD AND OF HIS CHRIST, AND HE WILL REIGN FOREVER AND EVER."

16. Then the four and twenty Elders who are seated before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshiped God,

17. saying. "We give thee thanks, O Lord God, The Almighty, who art and who wast; For thou hast taken thy great power, And begun to reign.

18. The nations raged, and thy wrath came, And the time for the dead to be judged; The time for rewarding thy slaves, the prophets And the saints, and those who reverence thy name, Both small and great; And the time to destroy those who are destroying the earth."

19. Then the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen inside his sanctuary; and there followed lightnings and voices and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail.

## Revelation 12

1. And a great sign was seen in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun,  and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a diadem of twelve stars.

2. She was with child; and she cried out, travailing in birth, in anguish to be delivered.

3. And another sign was seen in heaven; and lo, a great red dragon,  with seven heads and ten horns, and upon his head seven diadems.

4. His tail drew a third part of the stars of the sky, and dashed them down to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman about to be delivered, so that he might devour her child when she was delivered.

5. And she gave birth to a son, a man child, who is to shepherd all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up unto God and unto his throne.

6. And the woman fled into the desert, where she has a place prepared by God, in which she is to be nourished for a thousand two hundred and threescore days.

7. And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels went forth to war with the dragon; and the dragon also fought, and his angels;

8. but they failed, nor was their place found any more in heaven.

9. Now the great dragon was thrown down - that old Serpent, he who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.

10. And I heard a great voice in heaven, which said. "Now it is come!  the salvation and the power, The kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ! For the accuser of our brethren is thrown down, Who accused them before our God, day and night.

11. And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb, And by the word of their testimony; And they loved not their life, even unto death.

12. Therefore rejoice, O heavens, And you who dwell therein! Woe to the earth and the sea! For the devil has gone down to you in great fury,  Because he knows that he has but little time."

13. When the dragon saw that he was hurled down to the earth, he pursued the woman who gave birth to the man child.

14. But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle, so that she might fly into the desert to her place where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.

15. And the serpent poured water from his mouth after the woman, water like a river, so that he might cause her to be carried off by the stream.

16. But the earth came to the rescue of the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragon had poured forth from his mouth.

17. And the dragon was enraged at the woman, and went away to make war upon the rest of her children who keep the commandments of God, and hold fast the testimony of Jesus. And he stood upon the sand of the sea.

## Revelation 13

1. Then I saw rising up out of the sea a beast who had ten horns and seven heads. On his horns he had ten diadems, and on his heads blasphemous titles.

2. The beast I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were bears feet,  and his mouth a lions mouth. The dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.

3. And I saw that one of his heads seemed to have been mortally wounded, but its deadly wound had been healed. The whole earth was following the beast, wondering.

4. Men worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast;  and they worshiped the beast, saying. "Who is like the beast? Who can fight with him?"

5. And he was permitted to utter loud boasts and blasphemies; and there was given to him authority to continue forty-two months.

6. So he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle (those who live in his tabernacle in heaven).

7. The beast was allowed to wage war upon the saints, and to conquer them; and there was given him authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation;

8. and each one whose name has not been written in the Lambs book of life, the Lamb who has been slain from the foundation of the world.  All who dwell on the earth shall worship him.

9. Let him who has ears to hear, listen.

10. Whoever is destined to go into captivity, goes into captivity.  Whoever shall kill with the sword, shall surely be killed by the sword. (Here is the endurance and faith of the saints.)

11. And I saw another beast ascending from the land; and he had two horns like a lamb, but he spoke like a dragon;

12. and he exerts the full authority of the first beast before him, and he makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast whose death-stroke was healed.

13. And he performs great miracles, so that he even causes fire to come down to the earth from the sky, before mens eyes.

14. And he deceives those who dwell on the earth, because of the miracles, which he is permitted to perform in the sight of the beast.  He tells those who live on the earth to make an image to the beast who had the sword-stroke, yet lived.

15. And he was permitted to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast should speak; and so that any one who would not worship the image of the beast should be put to death.

16. And he makes all men, low and high, rich and poor, freemen and slaves, to have a brand put upon their right hands or upon their brows,

17. so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the brand of the beast,  or the number of his name.

18. Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man; and his number is 666.

## Revelation 14

1. And I looked, and lo, there was the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with were a hundred and forty and four thousand who had his name and his Fathers name written on their foreheads.

2. And I heard a voice from heaven like the voice of many waters, and the voice of a great thunder; and I heard the voice of harpers harping on their harps.

3. They were singing a new song before the throne, and before the four Living Creatures and the Elders; and none can learn that song, except the one hundred and forty and four thousand, who had been redeemed from the earth.

4. These are they who were not defiled with women; for they are celibates. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They have been redeemed from among men to be the first-fruits unto God and the Lamb.

5. No lie was ever found on their lips; they are spotless.

6. Then I saw another angel who was flying in mid-heaven. He had an eternal evangel, to evangelize all the dwellers on the earth, of every nation and tribe and tongue and people.

7. And he cried with a loud voice. "Fear God and give him glory,  Because the hour of his judgment is come. And worship Him who made the heavens and the earth And the sea and springs of waters."

8. Then a second angel followed, crying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great, Who has made all the nations drink the wine Of the frenzy of her fornication."

9. And another angel, a third, followed them, crying with a mighty voice. "Whoever worships the beast and his image, And receives a brand on his forehead or on his hand,

10. He also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, Poured out unmixed in the cup of his anger; And he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone In the presence of the holy angels, And in the presence of the Lamb,

11. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; And they have no rest day or night, Who worship the beast and his image, And all who receive the brand of his name."

12. Here is the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

13. And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, "Write, Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord from henceforth! Yea, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, For their deeds do follow them."

14. And I looked, and lo, a white cloud; and on the cloud I saw One sitting like to a son of man, with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand.

15. And another angel came out of the temple, shouting with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud. "Thrust in your sickle, and reap; for the time to reap is come. The harvest of the earth is overripe."

16. And he who sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.

17. And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, and he,  too, had a sharp sickle.

18. And another angel came from the altar, the angel who has power over fire, and he called with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, saying, "Thrust in your sharp sickle, And gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, For its grapes are fully ripe."

19. So the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the clusters of the vine of the earth, and threw them into the winepress,  the great winepress of the wrath of God.

20. And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood gushed out of the winepress, even to the bridles of the horses, as far as two hundred miles.

## Revelation 15

1. And I beheld another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels with the seven last plagues; because with them the wrath of God is finished.

2. And I saw the semblance of a glassy sea, mingled with fire; and standing by this glassy sea, with harps of God, were those who came off conquerors from the beast and from his image and from the cipher of his name.

3. They were singing the song of Moses, the slave of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying. "Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God,  the Almighty! Righteous and true are thy ways, Thou King of kings!

4. Who shall not fear, O Lord, And glorify thy name? For thou only art holy. For all the nations shall come and worship before thee; For thy righteous acts have been made evident."

5. After that I looked, and the sanctuary of the tabernacle of testimony was opened in heaven;

6. and there came out of the sanctuary the seven angels with the seven plagues. They were clothed in white linen, pure and bright, and girt about the breasts with golden girdles.

7. And one of the four Living Creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls, full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.

8. The sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory and majesty of God; and no one could enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.

## Revelation 16

1. Then I heard a loud voice which came out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, "Go, empty the seven bowls of the wrath of God upon the earth."

2. The first angel went and poured out his bowl upon the earth. And it was turned to loathsome and painful sores upon all who bore the brand of the beast, and who worshiped his image.

3. And the second angel poured out his bowl upon the sea; and it became blood, like the blood of a corpse, and every living creature died -  everything in the sea.

4. And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of waters; and they were turned into blood.

5. And I heard the angel of the waters saying. "Righteous art thou,  thou who art and wast, The Holy One, Because thou didst inflict this judgment.

6. For men poured out the blood of thy saints and prophets, And thou hast given them blood to drink. And this they deserved."

7. And I heard the altar saying, "Yea, O Lord, the Almighty, True and righteous are thy judgments."

8. And the fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun, and the sun was permitted to scorch men with fire.

9. And men were scorched with the terrible heat; and they blasphemed the name of the God who had the power over these plagues; yet they repented not, to give him glory.

10. And the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom became darkened, and men gnawed their tongues for pain,

11. and they blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and their sores; yet of their deeds they did not repent.

12. And the sixth poured his bowl upon the great river, the River Euphrates, and its water was dried up so as to make ready the way for the kings that come from the sunrising.

13. And I saw three unclean spirits, like frogs, coming out of the dragons mouth, and the beasts mouth, and the false prophets mouth.

14. For these are the spirits of demons performing miracles, who go forth to the kings of the habitable earth, to gather them together for the battle of the great Day of God, the Almighty.

15. Lo, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the who is on the watch and guarding his clothing, so that he may not walk naked, and they gaze on his shame.

16. And the spirits gathered the kings together at the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon.

17. And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air, and a great voice came forth out of the temple from the throne, saying, "It is finished!"

18. And lightnings and voices and thunders and a great earthquake such as had not happened since man began to be upon the earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty;

19. and the great city was shattered into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, and great Babylon came to mind before the face of God, to give her the cup of the wine of the passion of his anger.

20. And every island fled away, and the mountains sank from sight.

21. And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, for the plague of it is very great.

## Revelation 17

1. And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, and spoke to me, saying, "Come hither and I will show you the sentence passed upon the great harlot who sits on many waters,

2. with whom the kings of the earth have committed adultery, while all who live on the earth have been made drunken by the wine of her immorality."

3. And he bore me away in the Spirit into the desert, and I saw a woman who sat upon a scarlet beast covered with blasphemous names. It had seven heads and ten horns.

4. The woman was enwrapped in purple and scarlet and was encrusted with gold and precious stones and pearls. In her hand she held a golden cup filled with abominations, even the impurities of her immorality.

5. Upon her forehead a name was written, a mystery, "BABYLON THE GREAT,  THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS, AND ABOMINABLE THINGS OF THE EARTH."

6. And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus, and I wondered with a great wonder.

7. And the angel said to me. "Why did you wonder? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast with the seven heads and ten horns, that carried her.

8. The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the bottomless pit, and to go into perdition. And those who dwell on the earth shall wonder, those whose names have never, from the foundation of the world, been written in the Lambs Book of Life,  when they gaze on the beast; how he was and is not, and is to come.

9. Here is the mind that has wisdom. the seven heads are seven hills on which the woman is seated;

10. and they are seven kings; the five have fallen, one is, the other is not yet come (and when he does come, he must remain a short time).

11. And the beast who was, but is not, is himself also an eighth,  although he is one of the seven kings, and is on his way to perdition.

12. "The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received their kingdoms; but they have received authority as kings for one hour, together with the beast.

13. These kings have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast.

14. These will make war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for he is the Lord of lords, and King of kings. And they who are with him are called and faithful and chosen."

15. And he also said to me. "The waters which you saw, on which the harlot takes her seat, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.

16. And the ten horns which you saw, they and the beast will hate the harlot and make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh and burn her up with fire.

17. For God has put it into their hearts to execute his purpose, in executing their common purpose, and by giving over their kingdoms to the beast, until the words of God shall be accomplished.

18. The woman whom you saw is the great city which holds sway over the kings of the earth."

## Revelation 18

1. After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven, who had great authority; and the earth was illumined by his glory.

2. He shouted with a mighty cry, saying. "She is fallen! She is fallen,  Babylon the great! Now she is a dwelling-place of demons, A stronghold of every foul spirit, A stronghold of every foul and hateful bird.

3. For all nations, having drunk the wine of the frenzy of her fornication, are fallen; And the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, And the merchants of the earth have grown rich by the power of her wantonness."

4. And behold I heard another voice from heaven saying. "Come out of her, that you have no fellowship with her sins, And that you receive not her plagues.

5. For her sins have been heaped to heaven, And God has remembered her iniquities.

6. Render to her what she rendered; Yes, pay double what her deeds deserve. In the cup she mixed, mix double for her.

7. By so much as she glorified herself and waxed wanton, By so much give her of torture and tears, For she says in her heart, I sit here a queen, I am no widow. I shall in no wise see mourning.

8. Therefore in one day shall these plagues come upon her, Death and mourning and famine, And she shall be burnt with fire; For mighty is the Lord God, her judge.

9. And the kings of the earth who committed fornication And lived wantonly with her, Will weep and wail over her, When they behold the smoke of her burning,

10. Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Woe, woe,  the great city Babylon, the strong city! In one hour is your judgment come!

11. "And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, For no one buys their merchandise any more -

12. Merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones, Of pearls, and fine linen, and purple and silk and scarlet; All citron wood, and vessels of ivory, And vessels of rare wood and brass and iron and marble;

13. Cinnamon and balsam and spices and myrrh and frankincense; Wine and oil and fine flour and wheat; Cattle and sheep, and horses and chariots, And slaves, and the souls of men.

14. And the fruits which your soul lusted for are gone from you, And all things that were dainty and sumptuous are perished from you, And men shall find them nevermore.

15. "The traders in those things, who were enriched by her, shall stand afar off for fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,

16. saying. "Woe, woe, the great city! She who was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, And adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls!

17. In one hour so great riches is made desolate!" And every shipmaster and every one who sails to any port, And sailors, and all seafaring folk,

18. Stood at a distance, and as they saw the smoke from the burning city, cried, "What city can compare with the great city?

19. And they threw dust on their heads, and cried out, Weeping and mourning, saying, "Woe, woe, the great city, In which all who have ships on the sea Grew rich through her luxury! For in one hour she is made desolate!"

20. Rejoice over her, O Heaven! Rejoice, ye saints, apostles, prophets!  For God has now avenged you.

21. Then a mighty angel lifted a boulder like a great millstone, and hurled it into the sea, saying, "So shall Babylon, the great city, be overthrown with a mighty fall, And shall be found no more at all.

22. No more shall the voice of harpers and minstrels, flute-players and trumpeters Be heard in you. No more shall any craftsman of any craft Be found at all in you. No more shall the sound of a millstone be heard at all in you.

23. No light of a lamp shall ever shine in you again; And in you shall the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride be heard no more. For your merchants were the princes of the earth; And with your sorcery were all the nations deceived;

24. And in you was found the blood of prophets and of saints, And of all who have been slain upon the earth."

## Revelation 19

1. After this I heard the semblance of the mighty voice of a great multitude in heaven, crying. "Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power Unto the Lord our God!

2. For true and righteous are his judgments; For he has judged the great harlot Who was corrupting the earth with her fornication. On her he has avenged the blood of his slaves."

3. And a second time they said. "Allelulia! For the smoke of her torment goes up forever and ever!"

4. Then the four and twenty Elders and the four beasts fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, "Amen, Hallelujah!"

5. And a voice came forth from the throne, saying, "Praise our God, all you his slaves, All you who fear him, small and great!"

6. And I heard a sound like the voice of a great multitude, and like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of mighty thunderings,  saying. "Alleluia, for the Lord God omnipotent reigns!

7. Let us rejoice and triumph and give him the glory; For the marriage of the Lamb is come, And his bride has made herself ready,

8. And it has been granted to her to array herself in fine linen,  bright and pure; For the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints."

9. And he said to me, Write, "Blessed are those who have been bidden to the marriage supper of the Lamb." And he said to me, "These are true words of God."

10. And I fell down at his feet to worship him, and he said to me. "See that you do it not. I am a fellow slave of yours and of your brothers who hold the testimony of Jesus; for the testimony of Jesus is the vital breath of prophecy."

11. And I saw heaven opened, and lo! a white horse; and he who sat upon him was named "Faithful and True"; and in righteousness does he judge and make war.

12. His eyes are a flame of fire, and upon his head are many diadems;  and he has a name written, which none knows but himself.

13. He is clothed in a vesture dipped in blood; and his name is called,  THE WORD OF GOD

14. And the armies of heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and pure.

15. And there issues from his lips a sharp sword with which to smite the nations. He shall shepherd them with a rod of iron. And he treads the winepress of the passion of the anger of Almighty God.

16. And on his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS

17. And I saw an angel standing in the sun, who shouted in a loud voice to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven, "Come, gather yourselves together to the great supper of God,

18. to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of generals, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, bond and free,  small and great."

19. And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war on him who sat on the horse and on his army.

20. And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who performed miracles in his presence to deceive those who had received the brand of the beast, and those who worshiped his image. The two were thrown alive into the lake of fire, blazing with brimstone.

21. And the rest were slain with the sword of him who sat on the horse,  that sword which issued from his lips. And all the birds gorged themselves with their flesh.

## Revelation 20

1. And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, with the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.

2. He gripped the dragon, that old serpent, who is the devil and Satan,  and bound him for a thousand years,

3. and flung him into the bottomless pit, and shut and sealed it over him, so that he should seduce the nations no more, until the thousand years were completed. After that it is necessary to loose him for a little while.

4. And I saw thrones, and those who sat on them, and they were permitted to judge; and I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the Word of God, those who did not worship the beast nor his image, and who did not receive his brand upon their brow, or hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.

5. The rest of the dead did not live until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.

6. Blessed and holy is he who has a part in the first resurrection; on such the second death has no power, but they will be Gods priests,  and Christs; and will reign with him for a thousand years.

7. And when the thousand years have been completed, Satan will be loosed out of his prison,

8. and will go forth to seduce the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to marshal them for war - their number is like the sands of the sea.

9. And they went up over the broad earth, and surrounded the encampment of the saints, and the beloved city. Then fire fell from the sky and consumed them;

10. and the devil who had been deceiving them was hurled into the lake of fire and brimstone, where lie also the beast and the false prophet. And they will be tortured day and night, forever and ever.

11. And I saw a great white throne, and One who sat thereon; from his presence fled earth and sky, and no place was found for them.

12. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne; and books were opened, and another book - the Book of Life - was opened;  and the dead were judged according to their deeds, by what was written in the books.

13. The sea gave up the dead who were in it. Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them.

14. And all were judged according to their deeds. And Death and Hades were hurled into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.

15. And if any one was found who was not written in the Book of Life, he was hurled into the lake of fire.

## Revelation 21

1. Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and the sea is no more.

2. And I saw the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, made ready like a bride adorned for her husband.

3. And I heard a loud voice out of the throne, crying. "Behold, Gods tent is with men, And he will tent with them, And they will be his peoples. And God himself will be with them,

4. And he will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more, Nor will there be mourning, Nor crying, nor pain any more.  Because the first things have passed away."

5. And He who sat on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new." And He said to me, "Write this, for these words are trustworthy and genuine."

6. He also said. "It has now come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, The Beginning and the End. To him who thirsts I will freely give Of the spring of the Water of life.

7. He who overcomes will inherit these, And I will be his God, And he shall be my son.

8. But as for the cowards, the faithless, the abominable, And for the murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, Idolaters, and all liars, Their part will be in the lake that blazes with fire and brimstone. "This is the second death."

9. And there came to me one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the last plagues, and he spoke to me, saying. "Come hither! I will show you the bride, the Lambs wife."

10. And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain, huge and high;  and he showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God.

11. It had the glory of God. Its light was like some precious stone,  like jasper, clear as crystal;

12. with a wall great and high, and twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written thereon, the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.

13. On the east were three gates; and on the north, three gates; and on the south, three gates; and on the west, three gates.

14. And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

15. And he who spoke had a golden reed, as a measure, to measure the city and its gates and walls.

16. And the city lies foursquare; the length of it is as great as the breadth. Then he measured the city with the reed, fifteen hundred miles; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.

17. And he measured its wall, two hundred and sixteen feet, mans measure, which is an angels.

18. And its wall is made of jasper; but the city is of pure gold, like pure glass.

19. The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all kings of precious stones. The first foundation-stone was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,

20. the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.

21. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each gate of one pearl. And the broad street of the city was of pure gold, transparent like glass.

22. And I saw no temple in the city; For the temple is the Lord God, the Almighty, And the Lamb.

23. And the city has no need of the sun, Nor of the moon, to shine upon it; For the glory of God has lightened it, And its lamp is the Lamb.

24. And the nations will walk by its light. And into it the kings of the earth will bring their glory;

25. And its gates will not be shut by day, (For there is no night there);

26. And they will bring the glory and honor Of the nations into it.

27. There will not enter it anything profane, Nor any who work abominations and a lie; But only those who are written In the Lambs Book of Life.

## Revelation 22

1. And he showed me the river of the Water of Life, clear as crystal,  Flowing out from the throne of God, and of the Lamb,

2. In the middle of the broad street of the City. On each side of the river was a Tree of Life, Bearing twelve kinds of fruit, Each month yielding its own fruit. And the leaves of the tree Were for the healing of the nations.

3. And there will be no more curse But in it will be the throne of God and of the Lamb.

4. And his slaves will serve and worship him. They will see his face.  His name will need no lamplight nor sunlight, Because the Lord God will give them light; And they will reign forever and ever.

5. missing fehlt/missing

6. Then he said to me. "These words may be trusted, and are true. the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his slaves what must soon take place.

7. "And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book."

8. And I, John, am he who heard and saw these things. And after I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me.

9. But he said to me. "See thou do it not. I am only a fellow slave with you and your brothers, the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this Book. "WORSHIP GOD!"

10. And he said to me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book; for the crisis is near.

11. He who is wicked, let him be wicked still; He who is filthy, let him be filthy still; He who is righteous, lit him practise righteousness still; And he who is holy, let him be made holy still.

12. Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, To give to each man what his actions merit.

13. I am the Alpha and the Omega, The First and the Last, The Beginning and the End.

14. "Blessed are they who wash their robes, so that they may have right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in by the gates into the City.

15. Without are the dogs, the sorcerers, the immoral, the murderers, the idolaters, and all who live and make a lie.

16. "I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning Star.

17. "And the Spirit and the Bride say Come! And let him who hears, say Come! And let him who thirsts, come; And whoever wills, let him take the Water of Life freely."

18. I testify to every man who hears the words of the prophecy of this book. If any man shall add to them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this book;

19. and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the Tree of Life, and in the Holy City, about which this book is written.

20. He who testifies this says, "Yea, I am coming quickly." Amen! Come,  Lord Jesus!

21. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with the saints!
