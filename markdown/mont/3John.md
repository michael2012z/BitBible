# 3 John

## 3 John 1

1. The Elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.

2. I pray that you may prosper, beloved, in every way, and be in good health, even as your soul is prospering.

3. For I was glad when brothers came and bore testimony to your truth,  as indeed you are passing your life in truth.

4. I have no greater joy than this, to hear that my children are passing their lives in the truth.

5. You are acting faithfully, beloved, in whatever you are doing for the brothers and the strangers.

6. They have borne testimony to your love before the church. You will do well to speed them on their way worthily of God;

7. since for the sake of the Name they have started out, taking nothing from the Gentiles.

8. Hence we ought to support such, so that we may become fellow workers for the truth.

9. I have written somewhat to the church; but Diotrephes, who love to take the lead among them, does not receive me.

10. Do them when I come I will recall to mind the deeds which he is doing, prating against me with wicked words. Not satisfied with that,  he refuses to receive the brothers, forbids those that would receive them, and excommunicates them from the church.

11. Do not imitate what is evil, beloved, but that which is good. He who does good is of God; he who does evil has never gazed on God.

12. All men bear testimony to Demetrius, and so does the truth itself. I also bear testimony to him; and you know that my testimony is true.

13. I have a great deal to write to you, but I do not want to write you with pen and ink.

14. I am hoping soon to see you, and then we shall talk face to face.  Peace be to you! The friends send their salutation. Salute the friends by name.
