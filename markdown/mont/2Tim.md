# 2 Timothy

## 2 Timothy 1

1. Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God, sent forth to proclaim the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus.

2. To Timothy, my beloved child; Grace mercy, and peace to you from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

3. I give thanks to God whom I worship with a pure conscience as my fathers did, when I remember you unceasingly in my prayers.

4. Night and day when I recall your tears I am longing to see you, that my happiness may be complete.

5. I have been reminded of that sincere faith which is in your heart;  which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice,  and, I am fully persuaded, dwells in you also.

6. For this reason let me remind you to keep ever blazing that gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.

7. For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but a spirit of power and of love and of self-control.

8. Do not then be ashamed to bear witness for our Lord, nor for me, his prisoner. Nay, join with me in suffering for the gospel by the power of God.

9. He has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not dealing with us according to our works,but according to his purpose and grace which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time.

10. This has now been made manifest through the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who has put an end to death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.

11. Of the gospel I was appointed a herald, apostle, and teacher; and that is the reason I am now undergoing these sufferings.

12. But I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have fully believed, and I am thoroughly persuaded that he is able to keep what I have given him until the Day.

13. Hold fast the pattern of sound teaching you have heard from me in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

14. Guard the glorious trust which has been committed to you by the aid of the Holy Spirit who makes his home in us.

15. You already know that all the Christians in Roman Asia forsook me,  among them Phygellus and Hermogenes.

16. The Lord show mercy to the house hold of Onesiphorus; for many a time he refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain.

17. But when he came to Rome he sought for me until he found me.

18. The Lord grant him to find mercy form the Lord in that Day! And you know better than I how many services he rendered in Ephesus.

## 2 Timothy 2

1. Do you then, my son, strengthen you heart in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.

2. The teachings which you have heard from me, attested by many witnesses, deliver into the keeping of faithful men, who in their turn will be able to teach others also.

3. Take your share in suffering as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

4. A soldier in active service avoids entangling himself in the every-  day affairs of life, so that he may please his commander.

5. And again, an athlete is not crowned unless he obeys the rules of the game.

6. The farmer who has done the work should be the first to get a share of the crop.

7. Reflect on what I am telling you. The Lord will give you understanding in everything.

8. Always remember that Jesus Christ, a descendant of David, has been raised from the dead according to the gospel I proclaim.

9. For preaching it I am suffering, and am even put in chains as a malefacter.

10. But Gods message is no prisoner. That is why I endure everything for the sake of the chosen, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

11. Faithful is the saying. "If we have died with him, we shall also live with him.

12. If we endure suffering, we shall also reign with him. If we disown him, he too will disown us.

13. If we prove faithless. he abides faithful, for he cannot be false to himself."

14. Always call these truths to mens mind; adjuring them in the presence of God to avoid controversy. It is a useless thing, and subverts those who listen to it.

15. Strive earnestly to present yourself unto God, tested and proved worthy by trial, a workman unashamed, ever cutting a straight path for the message of the truth.

16. but avoid profane babble; for people will go farther and farther in impiety,

17. and their teaching will spread like a gangrene.

18. Among such are Hymenaeus and Philetus, who have gone astray concerning the truth by declaring that the resurrection is already past; and they are undermining the faith of some.

19. Nevertheless Gods firm foundation stands unshaken, bearing this inscription, THE LORD KNOWS THOSE WHO ARE HIS, and this also, LET EVERY ONE WHO NAMES THE NAME OF THE LORD RENOUNCE WICKEDNESS.

20. Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver,  but also of wood and clay, some for noble, some for ignoble uses.

21. If then a man keeps himself clear of these latter, he will be a vessel for honor, consecrated, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.

22. Flee from the passions of youth, but run after righteousness, faith,  love, and peace, in company with those who out of a pure heart call upon the Lord.

23. Ever shun foolish and puerile discussions, for you know that they lead to quarrels.

24. The Lords slave must not quarrel, but must be kind to all men; a skilful teacher, patient of wrong.

25. He must be gentle when instructing opponents; for possibly God may give them a change of mind for the recognition of the truth,

26. and they may come to their senses again, and escape the snare of the devil, as they are restored to life by God to do his will.

## 2 Timothy 3

1. But of this be sure. In the last days grievous times will come.

2. For men will be selfish, mercenary, boastful, haughty, blasphemous,  disobedient to parents, ungrateful, irreligious,

3. without natural affection, merciless, slanderous, dissolute, and brutal.

4. They will hate goodness, they will be treacherous, reckless, blinded with pride, lovers of pleasure, rather than lovers of God.

5. For although they keep up the outward form of religion, they deny its power.

6. Turn away from all such. Some of them creep into private houses and lead captive silly women who, laden with sins,

7. and led captive by ever-changing impulses, are always learning but never able to arrive at knowledge of truth.

8. As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so also do these men withstand the truth; being corrupt in mind and worthless in all that concerns the faith.

9. But they will not get on; for their folly will be made as openly manifest to all as was that of Jannes and Jambres.

10. But you, Timothy, have followed my teaching, my conduct, my aims, my faith, patience, love, endurance,

11. as well as the persecutions and sufferings which befell me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. You know all the persecutions I endured, and how the Lord delivered me out of them all!

12. Yes, and all who purpose to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.

13. But wicked men and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving others, and being themselves deceived.

14. But do you hold fast what you have learned and have held to be true.  You know those from whom you have learned it,

15. and how from a child you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.

16. Every Scripture, seeing that it is God-breathed, is also profitable for teaching, for refutation, for correction, and for training in righteousness,

17. so that the man of God may himself be complete, and completely equipped for every good work.

## 2 Timothy 4

1. I adjure you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus who is about to judge the living and the dead - by his appearing and his kingdom,  I adjure you - ;11 Luke only is with me. Pick up Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me in my ministry.

2. proclaim the message, be urgent in season and out of season;  convince, rebuke, encourage, with never-failing patience and teaching.

3. For a time will come when they will not listen to wholesome teaching, but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will heap up for themselves teachers upon teachers to satisfy their own fancies.

4. They will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to myths.

5. But as for you, be always self-controlled, face hardships, do the work of a missionary, discharge all the duties of your ministry.

6. I for my part am a libation already being poured in sacrifice; and the time of my unmooring is at hand.

7. I have fought in the glorious contest; I have run the race; I have kept the faith.

8. Henceforth there is laid up for me the garland of righteousness which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that Day,  and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.

9. Do your best to come to me speedily,

10. for Demas has deserted me for love of this present world, and is gone to Thessalonica; Crescens is gone to Galatia; Titus to Dalmatia.

12. Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.

13. When you come, bring the cloak I left in Troas with Carpus; also my books, but especially my parchments.

14. Alexander, the coppersmith, manifested bitter hostility toward me.  The Lord will requite him according to his works.

15. Be also on your guard against him, for he has violently opposed my arguments.

16. At the time of my first defense no one stood by me; on the contrary they all deserted me - may it not be laid to their charge!

17. Nevertheless the Lord Jesus stood by me, and strengthened my heart,  that through me full proclamation of the gospel might be made, and the Gentiles might hear it; and I was rescued from the lions jaws.

18. And the Lord will rescue me from every evil assault, and will preserve me for his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever! Amen!

19. Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.

20. Erastus remained at Corinth; Trophimus I left behind me ill at Miletus.

21. Do try to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brotherhood.

22. The Lord Jesus be with your spirit. Grace be with you all.
