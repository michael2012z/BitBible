# Titus

## Titus 1

1. To Titus, my true son in a common faith, from Paul, a slave of God,  and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of Gods elect, and to the knowledge of the truth which goes with piety;

2. I write in hope of life eternal which God who never lies, promised before times eternal,

3. but manifested in his own time; that word of his in proclaiming which I have been entrusted by command of God our Saviour.

4. Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.

5. I left you in Crete for this reason, that you might set right the things left unfinished, and appoint presbyters in every city as I had instructed you;

6. men who are blameless, the husband of one wife, with believing children who are not accused of riot or insubordination.

7. For indeed a presiding officer, as Gods steward, ought to be blameless, not self-willed or quick-tempered, not a drunkard or violent, or greedy of filthy lucre;

8. but he must be hospitable, a lover of the good, sober-minded, just,  holy, self-controlled.

9. He must hold to the faithful word according to the teaching, so that he may be able both to encourage by sound teaching, and to confute our opponents.

10. For there are many individuals who are unruly, empty talkers and deceivers, particularly those of the circumcision, whose mouths must be stopped;

11. for they upset whole households and, for filthy lucres sake, teach what they ought not to teach.

12. By one of their own number, by a prophet of their own, it has been said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons."

13. This testimony is true. So rebuke them sharply,

14. so as to make them sound in the faith, not giving heed to Jewish myths and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.

15. All things are pure to the pure; but to the contaminated and the faithless nothing is pure, nay, their very minds and consciences are tainted.

16. They profess to know God, but by their deeds they disown him; in that they are detestable, disobedient, and reprobate for good work of any sort.

## Titus 2

1. But do you, on your part, speak what becomes sound teaching;

2. that the older men be self-controlled, serious and sober-minded,  sound in faith, in love, in patience;

3. that older women likewise be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers or slaves to much wine, but teachers of what is right.

4. They should train the younger women to love their husbands and children,

5. to be sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind and submissive to their husbands, in order that Gods message be not maligned.

6. The younger men exhort to be sober-minded; in every respect showing yourself an example of good works.

7. In your teaching be serious and sincere.

8. Let the instruction that you give be sound and above reproach, so that our opponents may be ashamed because they find no evil things to say about us.

9. Exhort slaves to be obedient to their own masters, and to be well-  pleasing to them in every respect;

10. not to contradict nor pilfer, but to exhibit praiseworthy trustworthiness in every thing, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.

11. "For Gods grace has shined forth bringing salvation to all men

12. And schooling us to renounce impiety and evil passions, And to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present age;

13. While we look for the blessed hope and epiphany of the glory of our great God and Saviour, Jesus Christ.

14. He gave himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity, and to purify unto himself a people zealous of good works."

15. Thus speak, exhort, reprove with all authority. Let no one despise you.

## Titus 3

1. Remind them to be submissive to their rulers and authorities; let them be obedient, ready for every good work;

2. they must speak evil of none, they must not be quarrelsome, but gentle, showing perfect meekness toward all.

3. For we were ourselves once foolish, disobedient, deceived, slaving for various lusts and pleasures, passing our lives in malice and envy. We were hateful, and we hated one another.

4. But when the kindness of God our Saviour, And his love toward men shined forth,

5. He saved us, not because of any deeds that we had done in righteousness, But because of his own pity for us. He saved us by that washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit

6. which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;

7. In order that being justified by his grace, We might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

8. This saying is trustworthy. On this I want you to firmly insist;  that those who have faith in God must be careful to maintain honest occupations. Such counsels are good and profitable for men.

9. But avoid foolish questionings and genealogies and dissensions and wranglings about the law; for these are unprofitable and empty.

10. After a first and second admonition, refuse a man who is causing divisions;

11. you may be sure that such a man is perverted and sinning, and is self-condemned.

12. As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, join me in Nicopolis as quickly as you can, for I have arranged to winter there.

13. Speed Zenas the lawyer, and Apollos, on their journey diligently.

14. Let them want nothing, and "let our people learn to devote themselves to honest work to supply the necessities of their teachers," so that they be not unfruitful.

15. All who are with us salute you. Salute those who love me in faith.  Grace be with you all.
