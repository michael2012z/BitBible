## John 1

1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was face to face with God, and the Word was God.

2. He was face to face with God in the Beginning.

3. All things came into being through him, and apart from him nothing that exists came into being.

4. In him was life, and the life was the light of men.

5. And the light is shining in the darkness, and the darkness has not overwhelmed it

6. A man came into being, sent from God, whose name was John.

7. He came as a witness, that he might bear testimony concerning the Light - so that all men might believe through him.

8. He was not the Light; it was to bear testimony concerning the Light that he came into being.

9. The true Light, which enlightens every man, was then coming into the world.

10. He was in the world, and through him the world came into being, yet the world knew him not.

11. He came to his own creation, and his own folk welcomed him not.

12. But to all who receive him, to them he has given the right to become children of God, even to those who trust in his name;

13. who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

14. And the Word became flesh and tented with us. And we gazed on his glory - glory as of the Fathers only Son - full of grace and truth.

15. John bore witness concerning him, and cried aloud, saying, "This is he of whom I said, He who is coming after me has been put before me,  for he was before me."

16. For out of his fulness we have all received, yes, grace upon grace.

17. For the Law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.

18. No man has ever seen God; God, only begotten, who is in the bosom of the Father - he has interpreted him.

19. Now this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent some priests and Levites to him from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"

20. He acknowledged - he did not deny it - but acknowledged, "I am not the Christ."

21. "What then?" they questioned; "Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not."  "Are you the Prophet?" "No," he replied.

22. Then said they to him. "Who are you? That we may give some answer to those who sent us. What account do you give of yourself?"

23. He said, "I am a voice of one who cries aloud in the desert, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah."

24. Now it was some of the Pharisees who had been sent to him;

25. so they questioned him, saying, "Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"

26. "I indeed am baptizing in water," John said in reply, "but in your midst stands One whom you do not recognize,

27. One who is to come after me, whose sandal-strap I am not worthy to untie."

28. This happened in Bethany, beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.

29. The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said. "Behold, that is Gods Lamb, who takes and bears away the sin of the world.

30. This is he of whom I said, After me comes One who has been put before me, for he was before me.

31. I myself did not recognize him; I only came baptizing in water, in order that he might be openly shown to Israel."

32. John also bore this testimony, saying. "I saw the Spirit like a dove descend from heaven and rest upon him.

33. And I did not recognize him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, The one on whom you see the Spirit descending and resting upon him, is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.

34. This I have seen, and I am become a witness to the fact that he is the Son of God."

35. Next day again, John was standing with two of his disciples.

36. After gazing intently on Jesus as he walked about, he said, "Look!  that is the Lamb of God!"

37. The two disciples heard his exclamation, and they followed Jesus.

38. Then Jesus turned and saw them following him, and said, "What do you want?" They replied, "Rabbi" (which may be translated Teacher), "where are you staying?"

39. He said to them, "Come, and you shall see." So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was then about four oclock in the afternoon.

40. One of the two men who heard what John said and followed Jesus, was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.

41. In the morning he found his brother Simon, and said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (a word which means Christ, the Anointed One).

42. He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked intently at him and said. "You are Simon, son of John; you shall be called Cephas" (or Peter,  which means Rock).

43. Next day Jesus decided to go into Galilee; and he found Philip and said to him, "Follow me."

44. Now Philip belonged to Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter.

45. Then Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found him about whom Moses wrote in the Law, as did the prophets - Jesus of Nazareth,  Josephs son."

46. And Nathanael said to him, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"  Philip said to him, "Come and see."

47. Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, and said, "Behold a true Israelite in whom there is no deceit."

48. "How do you know me?" asked Nathanael. "Before Philip called you,"  replied Jesus, "when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."

49. "Rabbi," answered Nathanael, "you are the Son of God; you are King of Israel."

50. Jesus said in reply. "Do you believe because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree?

51. You shall see greater things than that! Believe me," he added, "you all shall see heaven opened wide, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man."

## John 2

1. Now two days after this there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there;

2. Jesus also was invited to the wedding, and his disciples.

3. And when the wine ran short, Jesus mother said to him, "They have no wine."

4. "Woman," said Jesus, "what have you to do with me? My time is not yet come."

5. His mother said to the attendants, "Whatever he may tell you to do,  do it."

6. Now there were six stone water - jars standing there, according to the Jewish rites of purification, each holding about twenty gallons.

7. Jesus said, "Fill up the jars with water."

8. So they filled them brimful. Then he said, "Draw some out now, and carry it to the master of the feast."

9. So they carried it. And when the master of the feast had tasted of the water which had been made wine, not knowing where it came from,  though the attendants who had drawn it knew, he called the bridegroom and said to him.

10. "Everybody serves first the good wine, and when people have drunk freely, the poor wine; but you have kept the good wine until now."

11. This beginning of signs Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee, and showed forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him there.

12. Afterward he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples, and remained there a few days.

13. Now the Passover of the Jews was near, so Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

14. There he found in the temple those who were selling cattle and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting there.

15. So he plaited a scourge of rushes, and drove all out of the temple -  both the sheep and oxen. He began to pour out the coins of the money-  changers, and to overturn their tables,

16. and said to those who were selling doves. "Take these things away!  Make not my Fathers house a house of trade!

17. His disciples recalled that it is written, The zeal of thine house will devour me.

18. Then the Jews asked Jesus, "What sign are you going to show us,  seeing that you do these things?"

19. "Destroy this temple," answered Jesus, "and in three days I will raise it up."

20. The Jews retorted, "This Temple took forty-six years to build, and will you raise it in three days?"

21. But he was speaking about the temple of his body; and when the disciples recalled what he had said,

22. after he had been raised from the dead, they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.

23. Now when he was in Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover, many believed in his name, when they beheld the signs which he did;

24. but for his part Jesus was not trusting himself to them, because he knew all men,

25. and did not need any ones testimony concerning man, for he himself knew what was in man.

## John 3

1. Now there was one of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler among the Jews.

2. This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him. "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher sent from God; for no man can do these signs which you are continually doing, unless God is with him."

3. "In very truth I tell you," answered Jesus, "that unless a man is born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God."

4. "How can a man be born when he is old?" Nicodemus replied; "Can he enter a second time into his mothers womb, and be born?"

5. "I tell you solemnly," Jesus answered, "that unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.

6. What is born of the flesh is flesh; and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.

7. Marvel not at my telling you, You must all be born again from above.

8. The wind blows where it wills, and you hear its voice, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with every one who has been born of the Spirit."

9. "How can this be?" said Nicodemus in reply.

10. "Are you the Teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?" said Jesus.

11. "Most solemnly I tell you we are speaking of what we know, and it is about that of which we were eyewitnesses that we give testimony. Yet all of you reject our testimony.

12. If I have told you earthly things and yet none of you believe me,  how will you believe if I tell you concerning heavenly things?

13. There is no one gone up to heaven, except the One who came down from heaven - the Son of man himself.

14. And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up,

15. in order that every one who believes in him may have eternal life.

16. "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever trusts in him should not perish, but have eternal life.

17. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world,  but that the world through him might be saved.

18. He who trusts in him is not condemned, but he who does not trust has already been condemned, because he has not put his trust in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

19. And this is the condemnation, that Light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.

20. For every one who practises wrong hates light, and does not come to the light, lest his actions be exposed;

21. but he who does what is true, comes to the light, in order that his actions may be shown to have been wrought in God."

22. After this Jesus and his disciples went into the countryside of Judea, and there he was staying with them and baptizing.

23. John also was baptizing in Aenon, near Salim, because there were many streams there, and people kept coming to receive baptism.

24. (For John had not yet been thrown into prison.)

25. Then some of Johns disciples got into a controversy with a Jew in regard to purification; so they came to John and said to him.

26. "Rabbi, see! The man who was with you on the other side of Jordan,  and to whom you yourself have borne testimony, is now baptizing, and everybody is coming to him."

27. In reply John said. "A man cannot obtain anything unless it has been granted to him from heaven.

28. You yourselves are my witnesses that I said, I am not the Christ,  but have been sent before him.

29. He who has the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegrooms voice. So then this joy of mine has now complete fulfilment.

30. He must increase, but I must decrease.

31. "He that comes from above is above all; but one who is of the earth,  of the earth he is, and of the earth he speaks. He who comes from heaven is above all.

32. He bears testimony to what he has heard and seen, yet no one receives his testimony.

33. Whoever does receive it has set his seal that God is true.

34. For he whom God sent utters the words of God; for God does not give the Spirit sparingly.

35. the Father loves the Son and has committed everything into his hands.

36. Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him."

## John 4

1. Accordingly when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard it said,  "Jesus is making and baptizing more disciples than John,"

2. (though Jesus himself was not accustomed to baptize, but his disciples),

3. he left Judea and returned to Galilee.

4. Now he had to pass through Samaria;

5. so he came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

6. Jacobs Spring was there. So Jesus, tired out with his journey, was sitting thus by the spring.

7. It was about noon, and a woman of Samaria came to draw water.

8. Jesus said to her, "Give me a drink" (for his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.)

9. "How is it," answered the Samaritan woman, "that you who are a Jew ask a drink from me, a woman, and a Samaritan?" (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)

10. "If you had known the free gift of God," Jesus answered, "and who it is that says to you, Give me a drink, you would have asked of him,  and he would have given you living water."

11. "Sir," said the woman, "you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; whence have you that living water?

12. Surely you are not greater than our Father Jacob, who gave us the well, and used to drink from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle, too?"

13. "All who drink of this water," Jesus answered, "will thirst again;

14. but whoever once drinks of the water that I will give him, shall never thirst any more, but the water that I will give him shall become a living spring of water within him, welling up into eternal life."

15. "Sir!" exclaimed the woman, "give me this water, so that I may not be thirsty, nor come all this way to draw water."

16. Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and then come here."

17. "I have no husband," answered the woman. "You are right in saying I have no husband,"Jesus said to her,

18. "for you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband; in this you have spoken truly."

19. "I see, Sir, that you are a prophet," replied the woman.

20. "Our forefathers worshiped in this mountain, yet you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship."

21. "Woman, believe me," said Jesus, "that the hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.

22. You are worshiping something you do not know. we know what we worship, for salvation comes from the Jews.

23. But an hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father is seeking such as his worshipers.

24. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth."

25. "I know," said the woman, "that Messiah is coming, who is called the Christ; when he has come he will tell us everything."

26. Jesus said to her, "I who am now talking to you, am he."

27. Just then his disciples came up, and were astonished that he was talking with a woman; yet not one of them asked him, "What do you want?" or "Why are you talking with her?"

28. Then the woman left her water-jar, and went away into the city and began saying to the people.

29. "Come! see a man who has told me everything that I ever did. He cant be the Christ, can he?"

30. They left the city and set out to go to him.

31. Meanwhile the disciples kept urging him.

32. "Rabbi," they said, "eat something." But he answered, "I have food to eat of which you know nothing."

33. So the disciples began to say to one another, "Can any one have brought him something to eat?"

34. Jesus said to them. "My food is to do the will of Him who sent me,  and to accomplish his work.

35. Do you not say, It wants yet four months, and then comes the harvest?Look, I tell you! Lift up your eyes and behold the fields,  that they are already white for harvest.

36. The reaper is already receiving wages and gathering a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.

37. For in this respect the saying is true, One sows, another reaps.

38. I sent you to reap a crop on which you have not toiled. Others have toiled, and you have reaped the benefit of their toil."

39. Many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him because of the word of the woman when she declared, "He told me everything that I ever did."

40. So when the Samaritans arrived, they began asking him to remain with them; and he stayed there two days.

41. Then many more believed because of what he said, himself; and they told the woman.

42. "We no longer believe because of what you said. for we ourselves have heard him, and we know that this is certainly the Saviour of the world."

43. After these two days Jesus went away from there into Galilee.

44. For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.

45. When he reached Galilee, however, the Galileans welcomed him, for they had seen all that he did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they,  too, had been at the feast.

46. So he came back again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. Now there was one of the kings officers whose son was lying ill at Capernaum.

47. When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him to come down and heal his son who was lying at the point of death.

48. Then Jesus said to him, "Unless you all see signs and wonders, you will not believe."

49. "Sir," said the kings officer, "come down before my little boy dies."

50. Jesus answered. "Go your way. Your son lives." And the man believed the word which Jesus spoke to him, and started to go home.

51. And when he was already on his way down, his slaves met him, saying that his boy was living.

52. So he asked them at what hour he had begun mend. They answered,  "Yesterday, about one oclock, the fever left him."

53. Then the father realized that it had left him at the very hour when Jesus had said to him, "Your son lives," and he himself believed, and his whole household.

54. This is the second sign which Jesus performed, on returning from Judea to Galilee.

## John 5

1. After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

2. Now there is in Jerusalem a pool near the Sheep-gate, called in the Hebrew, Bethesda.

3. It has five colonnades. In these there used to lie a great crowd of sick people - blind, lame, paralyzed.

5. And there was one man there for thirty-eight years in his infirmity.

6. When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been there a long time, he said to him, "Do you want to get well?"

7. "Sir," answered the sick man, "I have no man to put me into the pool whenever the water is troubled; and while I am trying to come, some one else steps down before me."

8. "Rise," said Jesus, "take up your bed and go walking away."

9. Instantly the man became well, and he took up his bed and started to walk. Now it was Sabbath on that day;

10. so the Jews kept saying to the man who had been cured. "It is the Sabbath Day; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed."

11. He replied, "The man who healed me told me to take up my bed and walk."

12. "Who is it," they asked, "that said to you, take up your bed and go walking away?"

13. But he who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had moved away, as there was a crowd in that place.

14. Afterward Jesus found him in the Temple, and said to him. "Look! You have become well. Do not go on sinning, lest a worse thing befall you."

15. The man went to and told the Jews that it was Jesus who made him well;

16. and because of this the Jews began to persecute Jesus, because he had done it on the Sabbath.

17. But he answered them, "My Father has continued working until now,  and I am working too."

18. For this reason the Jews continued to seek the more eagerly to put him to death, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was actually speaking of God as his own Father, thus making himself of Gods equal.

19. So Jesus answered them in these words. "In solemn truth I tell that the Son cannot do anything of himself, except what he sees the Father doing; for whatever he does, that the Son does also.

20. "For the Father loves the Son, and shows him every thing that he himself is doing. And greater deeds than these will he show him, that you may wonder.

21. "For just as the Father raises the dead and makes them alive, even so the Son makes whom he will alive.

22. "The Father indeed does not judge any one, but has given all judgment to the Son,

23. "in order that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father.  He who does not honor Son, does not honor the Father who sent him.

24. "I tell you solemnly that he who listens to my messages and believes Him who sent me, has eternal life. He will not come under condemnation, but has passed out of death into life.

25. "Solemnly I tell you that the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear shall live.

26. "For as the Father has life in himself, so also has he granted to the Son to have life in himself.

27. "And he has given him authority to pronounce judgment, because he is Son of man.

28. "Do not wonder at this, because an hour is coming in which all who are in their graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth again;

29. "those who have done good into a resurrection of life, and those who have practised evil to a resurrection of condemnation.

30. "I can of my own self do nothing. As I listen, I judge, and my own judgment is just, because I am not seeking my own will, but the will of Him who sent me.

31. "If I bear testimony concerning myself, my testimony is not valid.

32. "Another bears testimony to me, and I know that the testimony which he bears concerning me is valid.

33. "You yourselves sent to John, and he has been and is a witness to the truth.

34. "(Though for myself I accept no witness from man; I only mention that you may be saved.)

35. "That man was the Lamp-burning and shining - and you were willing for a time rejoice in his light.

36. "But I have testimony greater than that of John; for the work which the Father has given me to bring to completion - the work which I am doing - bears testimony concerning me, that the Father has sent me.

37. "And the Father who sent me has himself borne testimony concerning me. None of you has heard his at any time or seen him,

38. nor had his word dwelling within you, because you do not believe him whom he sent.

39. "You are searching the Scriptures because you suppose that in tem you have eternal life; and though these are they that bear witness concerning me,

40. "you will not come to me that you may have life.

41. "I am not receiving honor from men, but I know you,

42. "that you have not the love of God in yourselves.

43. "I am come in the name of my Father and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, him you will receive.

44. "How can you believe when you receive glory from, one another, and have no desire for the glory which comes from the only God?

45. "Do not imagine that I shall accuse you to the Father. Moses is your accuser, on whom you build your hopes.

46. "For if you believed Moses you would believe me, for he wrote about me.

47. And if you do not believe his writings, how will you ever believe my words?"

## John 6

1. After this Jesus went away across the Sea of Galilee (that is the lake of Tiberias).

2. A great crowd were following him, because they witnessed the signs which he was continually performing among those who were ill.

3. Then Jesus walked up the hills and sat down there with his disciples. Now the Jewish feast, the Passover, was at hand.

4. Accordingly when he looked up, and perceived a great crowd was coming unto him,

5. he said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?"

6. He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he intended to do.

7. "Thirty-five dollars worth of bread," answered Philip, "is not enough for them, so that each can take a morsel."

8. One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon, said to him.

9. "There is a lad who has five barley loaves and a couple of fish; but what is that among so many?"

10. "Make the men sit down," said Jesus. The ground was covered with thick grass; so the men sat down, in numbers about five thousand. "of righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you will no longer see me;

11. Then Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks he distributed them among those who were seated; in like manner also of the fish, as much as they wished,

12. and when they were satisfied, he said to his disciples, "Gather up the fragments that are left, so that nothing may be wasted."

13. So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves - the broken pieces that were left after they had eaten.

14. So when the people saw the sign which he had performed, they said,  "This is in the truth the Prophet who is to come into the world."

15. When Jesus perceived that they intended to seize him in order to make him a king, he retired again to the hill all by himself.

16. When evening came on, his disciples went down to the sea.

17. There they got in a boat, and started across the sea for Capernaum.  The darkness had already fallen,

18. Jesus had not yet come to them, and the sea began to rise, because a strong wind was blowing.

19. After they had rowed three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking upon the sea, and drawing near to the boat, and they were terrified;

20. but he said to them, "It is I, be not afraid."

21. Then they were willing to take him on board, and immediately the boat reached the shore they were making for.

22. The crowd that remained on the other side of the sea had seen that there was only one small boat there, and that Jesus had not gone aboard with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away by themselves.

23. So, on the following day, when boats came from Tiberias near the place were they had eaten bread, after the Lord had given thanks,  they got into the boats themselves,

24. when they saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, and went to Capernaum to look for Jesus.

25. When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him,  "Rabbi, when did you get here?"

26. Jesus answered. "In solemn truth I tell you that you are looking for me, not because you saw miracles signs, but because you ate of the bread and were filled.

27. "Labor not for food which perishes, but for the food that endures eternal life - that which the Son of man will give you; for on the Father - God - has set his seal."

28. "What are we to do habitually," they asked him, "that we may keep working the words of God?"

29. "This is the work of God," answered Jesus, "that you believe on him whom He has sent you."

30. The they said to him. "What sign, then, are you performing, so that we may see it and believe in you? What work are you doing?

31. "Our fathers ate manna in the wilderness, as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat."

32. "In solemn truth I tell you," said Jesus in reply, "Moses did not give you the bread out of heaven, but my Father does give you the true bread out of heaven;

33. "for the bread of God is what come down from heaven, and gives life to the world."

34. "Ah, Sir," said they, "evermore give us this bread."

35. "I myself am the bread of life," answered Jesus; "he who comes to me shall never hunger, and he that believes on me shall never thirst again.

36. "But as I told you, you have seen me, and yet you do not believe.

37. "Everyone whom the Father gives me will come to me; and him who comes to me I will never reject.

38. "For I am come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.

39. "And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should not lose one of all those whom he has given me, but should raise them up at the last day.

40. "For this is my Fathers will, that every one who beholds the Son and believes on him, shall have eternal life. and I will raise him up at the last day."

41. Then the Jews began to find fault with Jesus, because he said, "I am the bread which comes down out of heaven," and they kept asking.

42. "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph? Do we not know his father and mother? How is it that he now says, I have come down from heaven?"

43. "Do not find fault with me among yourselves,"

44. answered Jesus; "no one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draw him; then I will raise him up on the last day.

45. "It is written in the Prophets, "And they shall all of them be taught of God. Every one who has listened to the father and learns from him, comes to me.

46. "Not that any one has seen the Father, except the one who is from God; he has seen the Father.

47. "I tell you solemnly that he who believes has eternal life.

48. "I am the bread of life.

49. "Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; yet they died.

50. "This is the bread that comes down from heaven, that one may eat thereof and never die.

51. "I myself am the living bread that has come down from heaven. Any one who eats this bread will live forever; and moreover, the bread which I will give is my flesh, given for the life of the world."

52. Then the Jews began to dispute among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"

53. "I tell you solemnly," said Jesus, "that unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.

54. "He who feeds upon my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life,  and I will raise him up on the last day.

55. "For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.

56. "He who feeds upon my flesh abides in me and I in him.

57. "Just as the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father, so also that man who feeds on me shall live by me.

58. "This is the bread which came down from heaven; not such as your fathers ate and died, for he who feeds upon this bread shall live forever."

59. He spoke these words while in the synagogue, while he was teaching in Capernaum.

60. So many of his disciples, when they heard it, said. "This teaching is unbelievable! Who can listen to him?"

61. Jesus, conscious within himself that his disciples were finding fault with him about his teaching, said to them.

62. "Does this displease you? What then if you were to behold the Son of man ascending to where he was before?

63. "The spirit is what gives life; the flesh is of no avail. The words which I have been speaking to you, are spirit and are life.

64. "Yet there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was who should betray him.

65. So he added, "This is why I told you that no on can come to me unless it be given from the Father."

66. Therefore many of his disciples drew back and no longer companied with him.

67. So Jesus appealed to the Twelve. "You also do not wish to leave me,  do you?"

68. Simon Peter answered. "To whom shall we go Master? You have words of eternal life;

69. "and we have learned to believe and we know that you are the holy one of God."

70. In reply Jesus said to them. "Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? And yet even of you one is an enemy."

71. Now Jesus was speaking of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot; for Judas was to betray him, although he was one of the Twelve.

## John 7

1. After these things Jesus continued to travel about in Galilee, for he did not wish to go about in Judea, because the Jews kept trying to kill him.

2. When the time of the Jewish feast of Tabernacles drew near,

3. his brothers said to him. "Leave here and go into Judea, so that your disciples also may behold the works which you are doing.

4. "For no one ever does anything in secret if he himself seeks to be known publicly. If you are performing these signs, show yourself openly to the world."

5. For even his own brothers did not believe in him.

6. "My time is not yet come," said Jesus, "but your time is always at hand.

7. "The world cannot hate you, but me it does hate, because I am bearing testimony against it, that its ways are wicked.

8. Do you go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast,  because my time is not yet fully come."

9. After saying this, he remained in Galilee; but after his brothers had gone up to feast,

10. then he went too - not openly, but as it were a secret.

11. The Jews meanwhile kept looking for him at feast, and saying, "Where is he?" "I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own Name these whom thou hast given me, that they may be one as we are one.

12. and there was much disputing about him among the crowd. Some would say, "He is a good man." Others. "No! he is misleading the people."  "While I was with them I kept them by the power of thy name which thou hast given me. I guarded them, and none of them was lost except the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.

13. No one, however, was speaking openly about him, for fear of the Jews. "But now I am coming to thee, and I am speaking these things while I am in the world, so that they may have my joy in all its fulness in themselves.

14. But when it was already the middle of the feast, Jesus went up to the Temple and began to teach. "I have given them thy word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

15. The Jews were amazed. They said, "How does this fellow know the sacred writings when he has never learned them?" "I am not asking that thou wilt take them out of the world, but that thou wilt protect them from the Evil One.

16. In reply Jesus said to them; "My teaching is not mine, but is his who sent me. "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

17. "If any one wills to do Gods will he shall know concerning my teaching, whether it is from God, or I speak my own authority.  "Dedicate them in thy truth; thy word is truth.

18. "The man who speaks on his own authority is always seeking his own glory. But one who is eager for the glory of Him who sent him, he is true, and therefore is nothing false about him.

19. "Did not Moses give you the Law? Yet none of you is keeping the Law.  Why are you seeking to kill me?"

20. The crowd answered. "You have a demon! Who is trying kill you?"

21. Jesus answered them. "There was one thing I did, and you are all amazed.

22. "Consider, therefore, Moses has given you circumcision - not that Moses originated it, but the fathers - and you are accustomed to circumcise a child even on the Sabbath.

23. "If a child receives circumcision on the Sabbath, in order that the Law of Moses may not be broken, how can you be angry with me because I made a man sound and well on the Sabbath?

24. "Do not judge according to appearance. Judge justly."

25. Then some of the men of Jerusalem were saying. "Is not this the man they are seeking to kill?

26. "And look! he is speaking boldly and they are saying nothing to him.  Can it possibly be that the rulers have really discovered that he is the Christ?

27. "But we know this man and where he is from; but when the Christ comes no one will know where he comes from."

28. So Jesus cried aloud as he was teaching in the Temple, and said.  "You both know me and you know where I am from; and I am not come on my own authority, but he who sent me is trustworthy, and him you do not know.

29. "But I now him, because I am from him and he sent me."

30. Then they kept seeking to arrest him, but no man laid hands on him,  because his hour was not yet come.

31. But many of the crowd believed on him and began to say, "The Christ,  when he comes, will he do more signs than this man has done?"

32. The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him, and the high priest and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.

33. Then Jesus said to them. "Still for a little longer I am with you,  and then I am going my way to him who sent me.

34. "You will search for me and will not find me, and where I am you cannot come."

35. Then the Jews said to one another. "Where does this fellow intend to go, so that we shall not find him? He is not intending to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and to teach the Greeks, is he?

36. "What does he mean saying, You shall seek me and you shall not find me, and Where I am you cannot come?"

37. Now the last day, that the great day of the feast, Jesus stood up and cried in a loud voice.

38. "If any man thirst let him come to me and drink. From the heart of him who believes in me will flow, as the Scripture said, rivers of living water."

39. Now he said this concerning the Spirit whom those who believed in him should receive. For the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.

40. Some of the crowd who had been listening to these discourses began to say, "Without a doubt this man is a Prophet."

41. Other said, "He is the Christ." But others were saying. "Surely the Christ is not to come out of Galilee, is he?

42. "Does not the Scripture say that the Christ is coming of the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, Davids town?"

43. So a division arose in the crowd concerning him. Some of them wished to apprehend him, but no one laid hands on him.

44. Then the officers returned to the chief priest and Pharisees,

45. and they asked them, "Why have you not brought him?"

46. The officers answered, "Never yet did a man speak like this man."

47. "Surely you have not been led astray, have you? answered the Pharisees.

48. "Has any one of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?

49. "As for this mob who do not understand the Law, they are accursed!"

50. Nicodemus, one of their number, he who had formerly visited Jesus,  said to them,

51. "Our law does not condemn the accused, does it, before hearing his defense, and finding out what he is doing?"

52. In answer they said to him. "You are not from Galilee, are you?  Search for yourself, and see that from Galilee arises no prophet."

53. Then they departed each to his own house.

## John 8

1. Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.

2. At dawn, however, he came back to the Temple, where the people came to him in crowds. He had taken his seat and was teaching them,

3. when the Scribes and Pharisees had brought a woman who had been caught in the act of adultery. They made her stand in the middle of the court, and said to him.

4. "Rabbi, this woman has been found in the very act of adultery.

5. "Now Moses, in the Law, has commanded us to stone such creatures.  But you, what do you say?"

6. (This they said to tempt him, so that they could bring a charge against him.)

7. But Jesus stooped down, and began to write on the ground with his finger. When they continued to question him, he raised himself and said to them, "Let the innocent man among you be the first to throw the stone at her."

8. Then he stooped down again, and again began to write on the ground.

9. When they heard that, they went out one by one, beginning with the eldest. And Jesus was left behind alone - and the woman in the middle of the court.

10. Then Jesus raised himself up and said to her. "Woman, where are they? Has no man condemn you,"

11. "No one, Sir," she answered. "Neither do I condemned you," said Jesus. "Go, and never sin again."

12. Once more Jesus addressed them. "I am the light of the world," he said; "He who follows me shall not walk in the darkness, but he shall have the Light of life."

13. Then said the Pharisees to him. "You are bearing testimony to yourself; your testimony is not true."

14. In reply Jesus said to them. "Even if I do bear testimony to concerning myself, my testimony is true, because I know where I have come from and where I am going. But you do not know where I have come from, or where I am going.

15. "For you are judging according to the flesh. I am judging no man.

16. "Though even if I do judge, my judgment is trustworthy, because I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me.

17. "And in your Law it is written that the testimony of two men is true.

18. "I am one who gives testimony concerning myself, and the Father who sent me gives testimony concerning me."

19. "Where is your Father?" they asked him. "You have neither known me nor my Father," answered Jesus. "If you had known me, you would have known my father also."

20. He said these words in the Treasury, while he was teaching in the Temple; yet no one arrested him, because his hour was not yet come.

21. Then again he said them. "I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sins. Where I am going, you cannot come."

22. Then the Jews said. "He will not kill himself, will he? Is that why he says, Where I am going you cannot come?"

23. And he said to them. "You are from below. I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.

24. "That is why I said that you would die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I am He, you will die in your sins."

25. "Who are you?" then they asked him. "What I am telling you from the beginning," Jesus answered.

26. "I have many things to say and to judge concerning you. But he who sent me is true, and I speak to the world only those things which I have heard from him."

27. They did not understand that he meant the Father,

28. so Jesus added. "When you lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am He; and that I do nothing on my own authority, but that I speak just as the Father has taught me,

29. "and he who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, for I do always the things that please him."

30. When he spoke in this way, many of the Jews believed in him.

31. So Jesus spoke to the Jews that believed him, saying. "If you abide in my teaching, you are my true disciples;

32. "and you shall know the truth, and the truth will make you free."

33. "We are descendants of Abraham," they replied, "and have never been in slavery to any man. What do you mean by saying, You shall become free?"

34. "In solemn truth I tell you," Jesus replied, "every one who commits sin is a slave

35. "Now the slave does not remain permanently in the household, but the son does remain.

36. "So then, if the Son shall set you free, you will be free indeed.

37. "I know you are Abrahams descendants; but you are seeking to kill me, Because my teaching has no place in you.

38. "I am declaring what I have seen with the Father, and you are acting as you have learned from your father."

39. "Abraham is our father," they answered. "If you are indeed Abrahams children," said Jesus "do the deeds of Abraham.

40. "But now you are seeking to kill me - a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God. Abraham did not do that.

41. "You are doing the deeds of your father." "We were not born of adultery," they said; "we have one Father, God."

42. Jesus said to them. "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I proceeded forth and am now come from God. I did not come on my own authority, but God himself sent me.

43. "How is it that you do not understand what I say? It is because you cannot listen to my message.

44. "You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do what your father desires. He was a man-slayer from the very beginning; and he has no standing place in the truth, because truth is not in him.  Whenever he utters a lie, he speaks from his nature, for he is a liar and the father of lying.

45. "But as for me, it is because I speak the truth to you that you do not believe me.

46. "Which one of you convicts me of sin? Why then, if I am speaking the truth, do you not believe me?

47. "He who is from God listens to Gods words. For this reason you do not listen, because you are not from God."

48. In reply the Jews said to him, "Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan, and you also have a demon?"

49. "I do not have a demon," said Jesus, "but I am honoring my Father,  and you are dishonoring me.

50. "Yet I am not seeking my own honor. There is One who is seeking it,  and He is judge.

51. "In solemn truth I tell you that if any one obeys my teaching he shall never behold death."

52. "Now we know that you have a demon," exclaimed the Jews. Abraham died, and so did the prophets; and yet you say, If any man obeys my teaching he shall never taste death.

53. "You are not greater than our father Abraham, are you? And he died,  and the prophets died. Who are you making yourself out to be?"

54. "If I glorify myself." said Jesus, "my glory is nothing. It is my Father that glorifies me, and you say, He is our God.

55. "You are not acquainted with him; I know him. Were I to say, I do not know him, I should be like you, a liar. But I do know him, and I obey his teaching.

56. "Your father Abraham rejoiced that he should see my day; and he saw it and was glad."

57. "You are not yet fifty years old," said the Jews to him, "and you have seen Abraham?"

58. "In solemn truth I tell you," answered Jesus, "that before Abraham came into existence, I am."

59. Then they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the Temple.

## John 9

1. Now as he was passing along he saw a man, blind from birth.

2. "Rabbi," his disciples asked him, "who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"

3. "Neither he nor his parents sinned." replied Jesus; "it happened that the works of God might be made manifest in him.

4. "I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no man can work.

5. "While I am in the world, I am the Light of the world."

6. When he had thus spoken he spat on the ground, and made clay with the spittle, and smeared the clay on the mans eyes.

7. Then he said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (a word which means "sent"). So the man went and washed his eyes, and came back seeing.

8. Upon this the neighbors and those who used to know him by sight as a beggar, began asking, "Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?"

9. Some said, "It is he." Others said, "No, but he looks like him." "I am the man," he said.

10. So they asked him, "How then were your eyes opened?"

11. He answered. "The man who is called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to Siloam and wash;so I went and washed and received my sight."

12. "Where is he?" they asked. "I do not know," answered the man.

13. Then they brought the man who had been blind to the Pharisees.

14. Now it was on the Sabbath that Jesus had made clay and opened his eyes;

15. so the Pharisees again began to ask him questions about how he had regained his sight; and he said to them, "He put clay on my eyes, and I washed them, and now I see."

16. Then some of the Pharisees began to say, "This man in not from God,  because he does not keep the Sabbath." But others said, "How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?"

17. So there was a difference of opinion among them. Accordingly they said to the blind man, "What have you to say about him, now that he has opened your eyes?" "He is a prophet," he answered.

18. The Jews, however, did not believe about him that he was blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man whose sight had been restored,

19. and questioned them. "Is this your son," they said, "who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"

20. Then in reply his parents said. "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;

21. "but how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who has opened his eyes. Ask him, himself. He is of age. He will speak for himself."

22. This his parents said because they were afraid of the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if any one should confess that he was the Christ, he should be expelled from the synagogue.

23. It was because this that his parents said. "He is of age. Ask him,  himself."

24. So the Jews a second time summoned the man who had been blind, and said to him.

25. "Give glory to God! we know that this man is a sinner." Upon this the blind man answered. "I do not know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know, that once I was blind, and know I can see."

26. "What was it he did to you?" they asked him; "How did he open your eyes?"

27. He answered. "I have told you already, and you did not listen. Why do you wish to hear it again? Can it be that you, too, wish to become his disciples?"

28. Then they stormed at him. "You are his disciple. We are Moses  disciples.

29. "We know that God spoke to Moses. But this fellow! We do not know where he comes from."

30. "This is truly astonishing," said the man in reply, "that you do not know where he is from, and yet he has opened my eyes.

31. "We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if any one is God-  fearing and does his will, to such he listens.

32. "Since the beginning of the world such a thing as opening the eyes of one who was born blind was never heard of.

33. "If this man had not come of God he could have done nothing."

34. They answered, "You were wholly born in sins, and do you teach us?"  Then they cast him out.

35. Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him,  he said, "Do you believe in the Son of man?"

36. "Who is he, Sir," he replied, "that I may believe on him."

37. "You have already seen him," Jesus answered, "and it is he who now speaks to you."

38. "I do believe, Sir," said the man, and he prostrated himself at his feet. And Jesus said,

39. "For judgment am I come into the world, to make the sightless see,  and to make the seeing blind."

40. Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this and asked, "We are not blind, are we?"

41. "If you were blind," Jesus answered them, "you would have no sin.  But now you are declaring, We see;so your sin remains.

## John 10

1. "In solemn truth I tell you that whoever does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs up some other way, that man is a thief and a robber;

2. "but he who comes in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

3. "The porter opens the door for him; the sheep listen to his voice;  and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.

4. "When he has brought all his own sheep, he walks before them and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.

5. "But a stranger they will not follow, but flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers."

6. Jesus told them this parable, but they did not understand what he was talking about; so he said to them again.

7. "In solemn truth I tell you that I am the Door of the sheep.

8. "All that came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.

9. "I am the Door. Whoever enters by me shall be saved, and he shall go in and come out and find pasture.

10. "The thief never comes except to steal and kill and destroy. I am come that they may have life, and may have it in abundance.

11. "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his very life for the sheep.

12. "The hired servant, since he is not a shepherd and does not own his sheep, leaves the sheep and flees when he sees a wolf coming - and the wolf worries them and scatters them.

13. "He is only a hired servant, and the sheep are no care to him.

14. "I am the good shepherd. I know my sheep, and my sheep know me;

15. just as the Father knows me, I know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep.

16. "I have other sheep also, which do not belong to this fold. I must bring them too, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd.

17. "The Father loves me for this, because I am laying down my life that I may take it again.

18. "No man is taking it away from me. I am laying it down on my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father."

19. The Jews were again divided over these words.

20. Many of them kept saying. "He has a demon and is mad! Why do you listen to him?"

21. Others were saying. "These are not the words of one demon-possessed.  Can a demoniac open the eyes of the blind?"

22. Then came the feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem.

23. It was winter, and Jesus used to walk in the Temple, in Solomons Portico.

24. Then all the Jews encircled him and kept asking him. "How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."

25. Jesus answered them. "I have told you, and you do not believe. The works which I am doing in my Fathers name, these bear witness concerning me.

26. "But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.

27. "My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them and they follow me.

28. "I am giving them eternal life, and they shall never perish, nor shall any one snatch them out of my hand.

29. "My Father who has given them to me is stronger than all, and no one can snatch them out of my Fathers hand.

30. "I and my Father are one."

31. The Jews again took stones with which to stone him. Jesus said to them.

32. "I have shown you many good deeds from my Father. For which of these are you going to stone me?"

33. "We are not going to stone you for a good deed," answered the Jews,  "but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, are making yourself God."

34. "Is it written in your law," replied Jesus, "I said, You are gods?

35. "If those to whom the word of God came are called gods (and the Scripture cannot be annulled),

36. do you mean to tell me, whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, You are blaspheming, because I said, I am the Son of God?

37. "If I am not doing the deeds of my Father, do not believe me.

38. "But if I am doing them, then though you believe not me, believe the deeds, in order that you may come to know and keep on clearly understanding that the Father is in me and I am in the Father."

39. Then again they attempted to seize him, but he escaped out of their hands,

40. and went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and there he remained.

41. Many who came to him said, "John did not perform any signs, but everything he said about this man was true."

42. And many believed on him there.

## John 11

1. Now a man named Lazarus was ill. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha

2. - it was Mary who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill.

3. So the sisters sent to him, saying. "Master, see who you hold dear is ill."

4. When Jesus heard it he said, "This illness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that through it the Son of God may be glorified."

5. Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.

6. However, when he heard that he was ill,

7. he still remained where he was for two days; then after that he said to his disciples, "Let us go back again to Judea."

8. "Rabbi," answered his disciples, "it was but just now that the Jews were trying to stone you, and are you going there again?"

9. Jesus replied. "Are there not twelve hours in the daytime? If any one walks in the daytime he does not stumble, because he beholds the light of this world;

10. but if any one walks during the night he does stumble, because the light is not in him."

11. This he said, then told them, "Lazarus, our friend, has fallen asleep, but I am going to wake him."

12. "Master, if he has fallen asleep, he will get well," replied the disciples.

13. Now Jesus had been speaking concerning his death, but they thought that he was talking about natural sleep.

14. So then he told them plainly.

15. "Lazarus is dead; and for your sakes I am glad I was not there, in order that you may believe. Come, let us go to him."

16. Upon this Thomas, who was called "The Twin," said to his fellow disciples, "Let us go too, that we may die with him."

17. so when Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been four days in the tomb.

18. Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, only about two miles away;

19. so a number of the Jews had gone to Martha and Mary to sympathize with them concerning their brother.

20. So when Martha learned that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him,  but Mary remained sitting in the house.

21. Then Martha said to Jesus. "Master, had you been here my brother would not have died;

22. but even now I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give you."

23. Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."

24. Martha answered, "I know that he will rise in the resurrection, at the Last Day."

25. "I am the resurrection and the life, "said Jesus. "He who believes in me, even if he has died, shall live.

26. And every one who is living and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?"

27. "Yes, Master," she answered, "I have come to believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world."

28. With these words she went away to call her sister Mary, saying privately, "The Teacher is here and is asking for you."

29. So when Mary heard this, she rose quickly and went to meet him.

30. Jesus had not yet arrived in the village, but was still at the place where Martha met him.

31. Then the Jews who were in the house trying to console her, when they saw that Mary rose quickly and went out, followed her, because they thought she was going to the tomb to weep there.

32. When Mary came to the place where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying, "Master had you been here, my brother would not have died."

33. Then when Jesus saw her sobbing, and the Jews likewise who accompanied her, sobbing, he shuddered with indignation in his spirit, and was deeply agitated.

34. "Where have you laid him?" he said. "Master, come and see," they answered.

35. Jesus burst into tears.

36. "See how he loved him," said the Jews. But some of them said,

37. "Could not this man, who has opened the eyes of the blind man, have prevented this man also from dying?"

38. Jesus therefore, again shuddering in himself with indignation, came to the tomb, which was a cave with a stone lying upon it.

39. "Roll away the stone," said Jesus. "Master," said Martha, the sister of the dead man "he is offensive by this time, for he has been four days in the tomb."

40. Jesus answered her, "Did I not tell you that if you would believe you should see the glory of God?"

41. Then they rolled the stone away; and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said.

42. "Father, I thank thee that thou hast listened to me. And I knew that thou art ever listening to me, but for the sake of the crowd who are standing about, I said it, in order that they may believe that thou hast sent me."

43. When he had said this he cried with a great voice, "Lazarus, come forth!"

44. Out came the dead man, wrapped hand and foot with grave-clothes, and his face bound up in a napkin. Jesus said to them, "Untie him, and let him go."

45. Many of the Jews, therefore, who had come with Mary, and had seen what he did, believed on him;

46. but some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.

47. So the chief priests and Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin.

48. "What are we going to do?" they said, "now that this man is performing many signs?" If we leave him alone, this way, every one will believe on him, and the Romans will come and rob us of both our sacred place and of our people."

49. But one of their number, Caiaphas by name, who was high priest that year, said to them,

50. "You know nothing at all, nor do you consider that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, rather than the whole nation be destroyed."

51. now he did not say this of his own accord; but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was about to die in behalf of the nation,

52. and not in behalf of the nation alone, but in order that he might gather into one the widely scattered children of God.

53. So from that day they plotted to kill him.

54. Jesus therefore no longer went about publicly among the Jews, but went away from there into the region near the desert to a town called Ephraim,

55. and there remained with his disciples. Now the Jewish Passover was near, and many people went up from the country to Jerusalem for purification before the Passover.

56. So they kept looking for Jesus and saying to one another, as they stood in the Temple, "What do you think - that he will not come to the feast at all?"

57. Now the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if any one knew where he was. he should give information, so that they might arrest him.

## John 12

1. So then Jesus came six days before the Passover, to Bethany, where Lazarus was whom Jesus had raised from the dead.

2. So they gave a dinner for him there, and Martha served it; but Lazarus was one of those who reclined with him at table.

3. Then Mary took a pound of pure spikenard, very costly, and poured it over his feet, and wiped his feet with her hair, and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.

4. Then said Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, who was about to betray him,

5. "Why was not this perfume sold for fifty dollars, and the proceeds given to the poor?"

6. This he said not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and, carrying the purse,

7. used to purloin what was put in it. Then said Jesus. "Let her alone.  Against the day of my burial has she kept this;

8. for the poor you have with you always, but me you have not always."

9. When the great mass of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, they came not alone because of Jesus, but to see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.

10. And the chief priests plotted to kill Lazarus too,

11. because it was on his account that many of the Jews were leaving them, and beginning to believe on Jesus.

12. Next day the big crowd who had come up for the Passover heard that Jesus was coming into Jerusalem,

13. and taking branches from the palm trees went out to meet him,  shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord.  Even Israels King!"

14. And Jesus found a young ass and seated himself on it, as it is written,

15. Fear not, daughter of Zion, Behold thy King cometh seated upon an asss colt.

16. His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus had been glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written concerning him, and what they had done to him.

17. Meanwhile the crowd which was with him when he summoned Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead, kept witnessing.

18. For this reason, too, the crowd came to meet him, because they had heard about this sign which he had done.

19. Then the Pharisees said among themselves. "You see! You can do nothing! Look! The world is gone after him!"

20. Now there were certain Greeks among those who had come up to worship during the Passover feast;

21. these came to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. "Sir,"  they said, "we want to see Jesus."

22. Philip went and told Andrew. Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.  Jesus answered.

23. "The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified.

24. In solemn truth I tell you that except a kernel of wheat fall into the ground and die, it remains a single kernel; but if it die it bears a great crop.

25. He who loves his life loses it; and he who regards not his life in this world shall keep it for eternal life.

26. If any one is ready to serve me, let him follow me; and where I am there shall my servant be also. If any man is ready to serve me, him will my Father honor.

27. Now is my soul disquieted. What shall I say? Father, save me from this hour?Nay, for this very cause I am come to this hour.

28. Father, glorify thy name!" Whereupon there came a voice from heaven,  saying, "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again."

29. Then the crowd who stood around and heard it, said, "It thundered!"  But others said, "An angel has spoken to him."

30. "It is not for my sake," answered Jesus, "that the voice came, but for your sakes.

31. Now is a judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be driven out.

32. "AND I, IF I BE LIFTED UP FROM THE EARTH, WILL DRAW ALL MEN UNTO MYSELF."

33. (In saying this he was signifying by what kind of death he was to die.)

34. Then the people answered. "We have heard out of the Law that the Christ abides forever. What do you mean by The Son of man must be lifted up?Who is this Son of man?"

35. "The Light is among you a little longer," answered Jesus. "Walk while you have the Light, lest darkness overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.

36. While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may become Sons of Light."

37. With these words Jesus went away and hid himself from them. But although he had wrought such signs in their presence, still they did not believe in him.

38. So the words spoken by Isaiah, the prophet, were fulfilled. Lord,  who hath believed our message, And to whom hath the Arm of the Lord been revealed?

39. This was why they could not believe, because Isaiah said again.

40. He hath blinded their eyes and make their hearts hard, Lest they should see with their eyes, perceive with their minds, And should turn, and I should heal them.

41. Isaiah uttered these words because he saw his glory, and he spoke of him.

42. Nevertheless, even among the rulers many believed on him, but did not confess in on account of the Pharisees, for fear lest they be put out of the Synagogue.

43. For they loved the approval of men rather than the approval of God.

44. Now Jesus, speaking in a loud voice, had said.

45. "He who believes in me believes not in me, but in Him who sent me;  and he who sees me sees him who sent me.

46. Like light am I come into the world, so that no one who believes in me may remain in darkness.

47. And if any one hears my words and does not keep them, it is not I who judge him; for I am not come to judge the world, but to save the world.

48. He who rejects me, and does not receive my words, has indeed a judge. The message which I have spoken, that shall judge him in the Last Day,

49. because I have never spoken on my own authority, but the Father himself who sent me gave me commandment what to say and what words to speak.

50. And I know that his commandment is eternal life. So whatever I speak, I speak as the Father has told me."

## John 13

1. Now just before the feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that his hour was come when he should leave this world to go to the Father,  having loved his own who were in the world, showed forth his love to the end. ;38 "Your life you will lay down for me? In solemn truth I tell you, the cock shall not crow before you have three times disowned me."

2. So while supper was proceeding, and the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him,

3. Jesus, knowing that the Father had given everything into his hands,  and that he was come from God,

4. and was now going to God, rose from supper, laid aside his upper garments, and took a towel and girded himself.

5. Then he poured water into the basin, and began to wash the feet of his disciples and to wipe them with the towel with which he had girded himself.

6. Then he came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"

7. Jesus answered him, "What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will understand it later."

8. Peter answered, "No, never shall you wash my feet." "If I do not wash you," said Jesus, "you have no part in me."

9. "Lord," said Simon Peter, "not my feet only, but also my hands and my head."

10. Jesus said. "He who has bathed needs only to have his feet washed,  and he is altogether clean; and you are clean, but not all of you."

11. (For he knew who should betray him, for that reason he said that they were not every one of them clean.)

12. So after he had washed their feet, and had put on his upper garments again, and taken his place, he said to them.

13. "Do you understand what I have been doing to you? You call me Teacher and Master,and you say well, for such I am.

14. If then I have washed your feet, I the Master and the Teacher, you also ought to wash one anothers feet,

15. for I have given you an example, that you also should do what I have done to you.

16. In solemn truth I tell you that a slave is not greater than his master, neither is a messenger greater than the one who sends him.

17. If you know these things, happy are you if you do them.

18. I do not speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen, but it is that the Scripture may be fulfilled, which says. "He who eats my bread has lifted up his heel against me.

19. "From this time forward, I tell you before it comes to pass, that when it is come to pass you may believe who I am.

20. In solemn truth I tell you, he who receives any one that I send is receiving me; and he who receives me is receiving Him who sent me."

21. When he had spoken thus, Jesus was deeply moved. He testified and said, "In solemn truth I tell you that one of you will betray me."

22. Then the disciples began looking at one another, wondering which one of them he meant.

23. There was reclining upon Jesus breast one of the disciples whom he loved.

24. So Simon Peter beckoned to him, saying, "Ask who it is about whom he is speaking."

25. So that disciples just leaned back against Jesus breast and said to him, "Lord, who is it?"

26. "It is that one," answered Jesus," to whom I am going to give a piece of bread, after dipping it."

27. So when he had dipped the bread, he took it and gave it to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon. And after he had received the piece of bread,  Satan entered into him. "What you do, do quickly," said Jesus.

28. Now no one at the table understood why he said this to him,

29. for some were thinking, as Judas kept the purse, that Jesus meant to tell him, "Buy the things that we need for the feast," or that he should give something to the poor.

30. When he had taken the piece of bread, Judas went out immediately;  and it was night.

31. So when he was gone, Jesus said. "Now has the Son of man been glorified, and God has been glorified in him.

32. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and straightway will he glorify him.

33. "My little children, I am only to be with you a little longer. You will seek me; just as I said to the Jews, Where I go you cannot come, so now I say to you.

34. I give you a new commandment, Love one another!

35. By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another."

36. Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where are you going?" "Where I am going," answered Jesus, "you cannot follow me now; but you shall follow me later."

37. "Why cannot I follow you now, Master?" said Peter. "I will lay down my life for you." Jesus answered him.

1. "Let not your hearts be troubled. You trust in God, trust in me also.

2. In my Fathers house there are many rooms If it were not so, would I have told you that I went to prepare a place for you?

3. I will return and will take you to be with me, so that where I am you may be also.

4. And the way is known to you all, where I am going."

5. "We do not know where you are going Lord," said Thomas, "so how can we know the way?"

6. Jesus answered him. "I am the Way, the Truth and the Life. No man ever comes to the Father but by me.

7. If you had known me, you would have known my Father too; from now on you know him and have seen him."

8. "Lord," said Philip, "cause us to see the Father, and we shall be satisfied."

9. "Have I been so long among you, and yet you, Philip, have you not recognized me? He who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, Cause us to see the Father?

10. "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me?  The words that I speak to you I speak not of myself; but the Father,  who ever dwells in me, is doing his own work.

11. "Believe me, all of you, that I am in the Father and the Father in me, or else believe me for the very words sake.

12. "I tell you solemnly that he who trusts in me shall himself do the works that I am doing; and still greater works than these, because I am going to my Father.

13. "And whatever you ask in my name I will do; that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

15. "If you love me, you will obey my commandments,

16. "and I will pray the Father,

17. "and he will give you another Comforter to be with you forever, the Spirit of Truth. The world cannot receive him because it does not see him nor know him, but you know him, for he is ever with you and within you.

18. "I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you.

19. "Yet a little while and the world shall see me no more, but you shall see me; because I live, you, too, shall live.

20. "At that day you shall understand that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.

21. "It is he who has my commands and obeys them that loves me; and he who loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him."

22. "How is it, Lord," said Judas (not Iscariot) "that you will manifest yourself to us and not to the world?"

23. Jesus replied."If any loves me he will obey my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.

24. "He that loves me not does not obey words, and yet the words to which you are listening are not mine, but the Fathers who sent me.

25. "All this I told you while still with you.

26. "But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything, and bring to your remembrance everything that I have told you.

27. "Peace I leave with you. My own peace I give to you. It is not the worlds Peace I give you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

28. "You heard me tell you, I am going away, and yet I am coming to you. If you loved me you would have been glad because I said I am going to the Father, for my Father is greater than I.

29. "And now I tell you this before it happens, so that when it does happen you may believe.

30. "I shall not talk with you much more, for the Prince of this world is coming.

31. "He has nothing in me, but in his coming the world may know that I love the Father, and that I do just as the Father commanded. Rise,  let us be going!"

1. "I am the vine, and my Father the vine-grower.

2. "He cuts back any of my branches that bear no fruit, and prunes every fruit-bearing branch, that it may bear more.

3. "Now you are clean through the word which I have spoken to you.

4. "Abide in me, and I in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine, no more can you, unless you abide in me.

5. "I am the Vine you are the branches. He who abides in me and I in him, bears abundant fruit; because apart from me you can do nothing.

6. "If any one does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers. Such branches are gathered up and thrown into the fire and burned.

7. "If you abide in me and my words abide in you, ask whatever your will is, and it shall be yours.

8. "By this is my Father glorified, by your bearing abundant fruit, and so being my disciples.

9. "As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you; abide in my love.

10. "If you obey my commands you will abide in my love, just as I have obeyed my Fathers commands and abide in his love.

11. "I have told you these things that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.

12. "This is my command, Love one another as I have loved you.

13. "Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.

14. "You are my friends if you do what I command you.

15. "I no longer call you slaves, because a slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything that I have learned from my Father.

16. "You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.

17. "This is my command. to love one another. If the worlds hates you,

18. "do not forget that it hated me first.

19. "If you belonged to the world, the world would love its own; but because you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, for that reason the world hates you.

20. "Remember what I told you, A slave is not better than his master.  If they persecuted me, they will persecute you. If they have obeyed my word, they will obey yours also.

21. "But they will do all these things to you for my names sake,  because they know not Him who sent me.

22. "If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.

23. "He who hates me hates my Father also.

24. "If I had not done among them such works as none ever did, they would have had no sin; but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.

25. "And so is fulfilled the word written in their Law, They hate me without cause.

1. "I have told you all this so that you may not stumble.

2. "They will excommunicate you from their synagogues; indeed the time is coming when any one who kills you will suppose that he is doing Gods service.

3. "And they will do these things because they have not known my Father, nor me.

4. "But I have told you these things, that when the time comes you may remember that I told you about them, myself. I did not, however,  speak of these things at first, because I was with you.

5. "But now I go my way to Him who sent me, yet none of you asks me,  Where are you going?

6. "but sorrow has filled your hearts because I have told you these things.

7. "Yet - I am telling you the truth - my going is for your good. For unless I go away the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart I will send him unto you.

8. "And he, when he comes, will convict the world of sins and of righteousness and of judgment;

9. "of sin, because they do not believe in me;

12. "I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them just now.

13. "But when he is come, that Spirit of Truth, he will guide you into the whole truth. For he will not speak on his own authority, but all that he hears he will speak, and will make known to you that which is to come.

14. "He will glorify me; for he will take of what is mine and will make known to you.

15. "Everything that the Father has is mine; that is why I said that he will take of what is mine and make it known to you.

16. "In a little while you shall behold me no more; and again in a little while you shall see me, because I am going to the Father."

17. At this some of his disciples said among themselves. "What does he mean by telling us, In a little while you shall behold me no more;  and again in a little while you shall see me, and because I am going to the Father?"

18. So they kept asking. "What does that little while mean of which he speaks? We do not know what he is talking about."

19. Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and said. "Are you questioning one another about my saying, A little while and you shall behold me no more, and again a little while you shall see me?

20. "I tell you solemnly that you will be weeping and wailing while the world is rejoicing; you will be grief-stricken, but your grief shall be turned into gladness.

21. "A woman in labor has grief because her hour is come; but when she has given birth to the babe she no longer remembers her anguish,  because of joy that a child has been born into the world.

22. "So you also have sorrow now, but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and your joy shall no man snatch away from you.

23. "And in that day you will ask me no questions. Most solemnly I tell you that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he will give you.

24. "Hitherto you have asked nothing in my name; ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be full.

25. "I have told you these things in figures; but the time is coming when I shall no longer speak in figures, but will tell you about the Father in plain words.

26. "In that day you shall pray in my name; and I do not tell you that I will ask the Father on your behalf;

27. "for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and believed that I came forth from the God.

28. "I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world. again, I am leaving the world, and am going to the Father."

29. "Ah," said the disciples, "now you are speaking plain language, and not using figures. Now we are sure that you know all things, and have no need for any one to question you; by this we believe that you came forth from God."

31. "Do you now believe?" said Jesus;

32. "behold the hour approaches and is already come when you will be scattered, each man to his home, and will leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.

33. "I have said all this to you that in me you might have peace. In the world you will have tribulation, but be courageous; I have overcome the world."

## John 17

1. When he had thus spoken, Jesus raised his eyes to heaven and said.  "Father, the hour is come. Glorify the Son, that thy Son may glorify thee;

2. "since thou hast given him authority over all mankind, to give eternal life to all whom thou hast given him.

3. "And this is eternal life, to know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.

4. "I have glorified thee on the earth; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.

5. "And now, O Father, glorify thou me with own self, with the glory I had with thee before the world began.

6. "I have made known thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world. Thine they were, and thou gavest them to me, and they have kept thy word.

7. "They know now that whatever thou hast given me was from thee;

8. "for I have given them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and they have believed that thou didst send me.

26. "And I have declared - and will declare - thy name unto them, that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them, and that I may be in them."

## John 18

1. After he had spoken these words Jesus went forth with his disciples to a place across the Ravine of the Cedars, where there was a garden into which he and his disciples went.

2. Judas the Traitor also knew this place; for Jesus and his disciples often met there.

3. So after getting troops and some Temple police from the chief priests and Pharisees, Judas came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.

4. Then Jesus, knowing all that was coming upon him, went forth to meet them, and asked them, "Who is it that you are looking for?"

5. "For Jesus of Nazareth," they answered. He said to them, "I am he."  (Now Judas also, the betrayer, was standing with them.)

6. When Jesus said "I am he," they drew back and fell to the ground;

7. so he asked them once more, "Whom are you looking for?" and they replied, "Jesus of Nazareth."

8. "I have already told you that I am he," said Jesus. "If, then, you are looking for me, let these go their way."

9. "(In order that the word which he had spoken might be fulfilled, "Of those whom thou hast given me I have not lost one.")

10. Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, and striking at the high priests slave, cut off his right ear.

11. (The slaves name was Malchus.) Then Jesus said to Peter. "Put up your sword in its sheath. the cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?"

12. So the troops and their commandant and the Jewish police took Jesus,  and bound him,

13. and led him to Annas first. (For Annas was the Father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year -

14. the Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was for their advantage that one man should die for the people.)

15. Meanwhile Simon Peter was following Jesus, and so was another disciple who was known to the high priest, and they went in with Jesus into the court of the high priests palace.

16. But Peter took his stand outside, near the door. So the other disciple who was known to the high priest came out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Peter in.

17. The doorkeeper (a maid servant) then said to Peter, "Are not you also one of this mans disciples?" "No I am not," he answered.

18. Now the slaves and the attendants were standing and warming themselves about a charcoal fire, which they had made because it was cold; and Peter also stood with them, and was warming himself.

19. Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.

20. Jesus answered him. "I have spoken to all the world openly. I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple, places where all the Jews are wont to assemble, and in secret I have spoken nothing.

21. "Why do you question me? Ask those who heard what I have said to them; these witnesses here know what I said."

22. When he had spoken these words, one of the police standing by gave him a blow with his hand, saying as he did so, "Is that the way you answer the high priest?"

23. Jesus replied "If I have said anything wrong, give evidence concerning the wrong; but if I said what was true, why do you strike me?"

24. Then Annas sent him in chains to Caiaphas, the high priest.

25. Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, "You are not also one of his disciples, are you not?" He denied it, saying "I am not."

26. One of the slaves of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Did not I myself see you with him in the garden."

27. Peter again denied it; and at that very moment a cock crew.

28. From the house of Caiaphas they took Jesus to the Praetorium, and it was dawn. They themselves would not enter the Praetorium, in order that they might not be ceremonially defiled, but might be able to eat the Passover.

29. So Pilate came outside to them and asked, "What charge do you bring against this man?"

30. In reply they said, "If he had not been a criminal, we should not have handed him over you."

31. "Take him yourselves," answered Pilate, "and judge him according to your law."

32. The Jews answered him, "We are not allowed to put anyone to death"  (that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled in which he predicted the kind of death he was to die).

33. So Pilate went into the Praetorium again, and summoned Jesus. "Are you the King of the Jews?" he said.

34. Jesus answered, "Are you saying this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me?"

35. "I am not a Jew, am I?" replied Pilate; "It is your own nation and the high priests who have handed you over to me. What have you done?"

36. Jesus answered him. "My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants have fought hard that I should not be handed the Jews; but in reality my kingdom is not of such origins."

37. "You are a king, then? You!" said Pilate. "You say truly that I am a king." answered Jesus, "for this purpose I was born, and to this end came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Every man who is of the truth listens to my voice."

38. Pilate said to him, "What is truth?" As he said this, he went outside again to the Jews and said to them.

39. "I find no crime in this man. Now it is a custom of yours that I release one prisoner to you at the time of the Passover feast. Do you wish me to release to you the King of the Jews?"

40. Then they all shouted again. "No, not him! Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a robber.

## John 19

1. After that Pilate took Jesus and had him scourged;

2. and the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns, placed it on his head,  and threw a purple cloak about him, and kept marching up to him,

3. saying, "Hail! King of the Jews!" They also gave him blow after blow with their hands.

4. Pilate again came forth and said to the people, "See, I am going to bring his out to you, that you may clearly know that I find no crime in him,"

5. Then as Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, "BEHOLD, THE MAN!"

6. So when the chief priests and the police saw him, they shouted.  "Crucify him! Crucify him!" "Take him yourselves and crucify him,"  said Pilate, "for I find no crime in him."

7. The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself out to be Gods Son,"

8. Now when Pilate heard these words he was more alarmed than ever,

9. and entering the Praetorium again, he said to Jesus, "What is your origin?"

10. Jesus made no answer. So Pilate said to him. "Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, or power to crucify you?"

11. "You would have no power over me," answered Jesus, "unless it had been given you from above. For this reason he who has betrayed me to you has the greater sin."

12. After that Pilate began to seek to release him, but the Jews shouted out. "If you release this man you are no friend of the Emperor. Any man who makes himself out to be king is a rebel against the Emperor."

13. On hearing what they said, Pilate brought Jesus out and made him sit on the judges seat in a place called the Mosaic Pavement (the Hebrew name is Gabbatha).

14. And it was the day of Preparation for the Passover, about six oclock in the morning. Then he said to the Jews, "Behold your King!"

15. Then they shouted. "Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!"  "Crucify your King?" said Pilate. The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar!"

16. So then he gave him over to them to be crucified.

17. So they took Jesus, who went forth bearing his own cross, to a place called The Place of a Skull - in the Hebrew tongue, Golgotha.

18. There they crucified him; and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them.

19. And Pilate moreover wrote an inscription and placed it above the cross. What he wrote was, "JESUS, THE NAZARENE, KING OF THE JEWS"

20. This inscription was read by many of the Jews, because the place where they crucified Jesus was near the city, and the inscription was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.

21. So the high priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write King of the Jews, but He said, I am King of the Jews."

22. Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written!"

23. After the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, to each soldier a part, and the tunic.  Now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom;

24. so the soldiers said one to another. "Let us not tear it. Let us draw lots, to see whose it shall be" - that the Scripture might be fulfilled. They divided my garments among them, For my raiment did they cast lots. This was what the soldiers did.

25. Now there stood near the cross of Jesus, his mother and his mothers sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.

26. When Jesus saw his mother, and standing near her the disciple whom he loved, he said to his mother, "Woman behold your son."

27. Then he said to the disciple, "Behold your mother." And from that hour the disciple took her to his home.

28. After that, when Jesus knew that everything was now accomplished, he said in fulfilment of the words of Scripture, "I am thirsty."

29. There was a jar full of vinegar standing there; and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon a stalk of hyssop, and put it to his lips.

30. Then after he had taken the vinegar, Jesus said, "IT IS FINISHED!"  And bowing his head, he yielded up his spirit.

31. It was Preparation Day, so in order to prevent the bodies hanging on the cross during the Sabbath (for the Sabbath was a great day) the Jews begged Pilate to have the legs broken, and the bodies taken away.

32. So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who had been crucified with him.

33. But upon coming to Jesus they saw that he was already dead, and did not break his legs.

34. One of the soldiers, however, pierced his side with a lance, and immediately blood and water flowed out.

35. And he who saw it has borne testimony, and his testimony is trustworthy, and he knows that he is telling the truth in order that you may believe.

36. For this happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled, Not one of his bones shall be broken.

37. And again another Scripture says, They shall look on him whom they have pierced.

38. After these things Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus,  but in secret because of fear of the Jews, asked Pilate for permission to take the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him leave. So he came and took the body.

39. Nicodemus also (the one who visited Jesus by night, at first) came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing nearly a hundred pounds.

40. So they took the body of Jesus and wound it in linen with the spices, according to the Jewish mode of burial.

41. There was a garden near the place where Jesus had been crucified,  and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid.

42. Here, because of its being Preparation Day, and as the tomb was near by, they placed Jesus.

## John 20

1. On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, while it was yet dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and discovered that the stone had been removed from the tomb.

2. So she came running to Simon Peter and that other disciple whom Jesus loved, saying, "They have taken the Master out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him!"

3. So Peter and the other disciples set out at once to go to the tomb.

4. They both began to run; and the other disciple ran faster than Peter, and came first to the tomb.

5. Stooping down he glanced in and saw the linen wrapping lying on the ground; but he did not go in.

6. Then Peter also came following him, and he went inside the tomb; and he gazed at the linen wrapping as they lay,

7. and the napkin which had been about his head not lying with the wrappings, but rolled up in its own place.

8. Then the other disciple also who arrived first at the tomb went inside, and he perceived and believed.

9. For not yet had they understood the Scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.

10. Then the disciples went back again to their home.

11. Meanwhile, outside, Mary stood sobbing near the tomb. Still sobbing she stooped and looked into the tomb,

12. and gazed at two angels in glistening white sitting, one at the head the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.

13. They said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She answered,  "Because they have taken away my Master, and I do not know where they have laid him."

14. When she had said this she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but did not know that it was Jesus.

15. Jesus said to her. "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking? She, supposing that he was the gardener, said to him, "Sir,  if you have borne him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will take him away, myself."

16. "Mary," said Jesus. She turned to him. "Rabboni!" she cried in Hebrew. That is to say, "Teacher."

17. "Do not cling to me," said Jesus, "for I am not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, "I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God."

18. Away went Mary Magdalene to the disciples with the tidings, "I have seen the Master!" and that he said these things to her.

19. On the evening of that same day, the first day of the week, although the doors of the room where the disciples gathered had been locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came, and there he stood among them,  saying. "Peace to you!"

20. As he said this he showed them his hands and his side. Then were the disciple glad, when they saw the Lord.

21. Then Jesus said to them again. "Peace to you. As my Father has sent me forth, I also now am sending you."

22. When he had said this he breathed upon them and said.

23. "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you remit any ones sins, they are remitted; if you retain them they are retained."

24. But Thomas, one of the Twelve, who was called "The Twin." was not with them when Jesus came.

25. Accordingly the other disciples kept telling him, "We have seen the Lord." But he told them, "Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and thrust my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe it."

26. A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, although the doors were locked, and stood there among and said. "Peace to you!"

27. Then to Thomas he said. "Place your finger here, and see my hands;  and place your hand here, and thrust it into my side, and become not unbelieving, but believing."

28. Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!"

29. "Because you have seen me, Thomas, you have believed," Jesus told him. "Blessed are those who, without seeing, yet believed."

30. There were then many other signs which Jesus performed in the presence of his disciples, which have not been written in this book;

31. but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.

## John 21

1. After this Jesus showed himself again to his disciples by the Sea of Tiberias. He showed himself as follows.

2. There were together Simon Peter and Thomas, called "The Twin," and Nathanael, from Cana of Galilee, and the two sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.

3. Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing." They answered him,  "And we are going with you." So they went out and got into the boat,  and throughout the night they caught nothing.

4. But when day was dawning Jesus stood on the beach. The disciples,  however, did not recognize that it was Jesus.

5. So Jesus said to them, "Lads, you havent any fish, have you?" They answered him, "No."

6. And he said to them, "Cast your net on the right side of the boat,  and you will find." So they cast it, and now they could not haul it in for the multitude of fishes.

7. Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!"  On hearing that it was the Lord, Simon Peter girt his fishers coat about him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the water.

8. The rest of the disciples came in the boat, for they were not far from shore - only about a hundred yards - dragging in the net full of fish.

9. When they got to the shore they beheld a charcoal fire ready laid,  with fish on it, and some bread.

10. "Bring some of the fish you have just caught," Jesus told them.

11. So Simon Peter went and dragged the net to shore, full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them; but for all this number the net was not torn.

12. "Come and have breakfast," said Jesus to them. Not one of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?" Knowing that it was the Lord.

13. Jesus went and took bread and gave it to them, and the fish also.

14. This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from among the dead.

15. When they were through breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon,  son of John, do you love me more than these others do?" "Yes, Lord,  you know that you are dear to me." he answered. Jesus said to him,  "Feed my lambs."

16. He said to him a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"  He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that you are dear to me." "Be a shepherd to my sheep," said Jesus.

17. The third time Jesus asked him, "Am I really dear to you?" Peter was grieved because the third time he asked, "Am I really dear to you?"  and he answered, "Master, you know all things, you know that you are dear to me."

18. "Feed my sheep," said Jesus. "In solemn truth I tell you that when you were young, you used to put on your own girdle, and walk wherever you wished; but when you grow old you will stretch out your hands for some one to gird you, and carry you where you do not wish to go."

19. This he said to show by what kind of death Peter was to glorify God.  After speaking thus, he said to him, "Follow me."

20. Peter turned around and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following - he who at the supper leaned back upon his breast and said,  "Lord, who is to betray you?"

21. On catching sight of him, Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, what about him?"

22. "If I choose that he remain until I come," said Jesus, "what is that to you? Do you follow me."

23. Accordingly the report spread among the brothers that this disciple should not die; but Jesus did not say that he was not to die, but said, "If I choose that he remain until I come, what is that to you?"

24. It is this disciple who bears testimony to these facts and who recorded them; and we know that his testimony is true.

25. But there are also many other things which Jesus did; if every one of them were to be recorded in detail I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would have to be written.
