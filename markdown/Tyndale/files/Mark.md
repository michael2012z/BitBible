3. The voyce of a cryer in the wildernes: prepare ye the waye of the Lorde make his paches streyght.

4. Iohn dyd baptise in the wyldernes and preche the baptyme of repentauce for the remission of synnes.

5. And all the londe of Iurie and they of Ierusalem went out vnto him and were all baptised of him in the ryver Iordan confessynge their synnes.

6. Iohn was clothed with cammylles heer and with a gerdyll of a skyn a bout hys loynes. And he dyd eate locustes and wylde hony

7. and preached sayinge: a stronger then I commeth after me whose shue latchet I am not worthy to stoupe doune and vnlose.

8. I have baptised you with water: but he shall baptise you with the holy goost.

9. And yt came to passe in those dayes that Iesus cam from Nazareth a cyte of Galile: and was baptised of Iohn in Iordan.

10. And assone as he was come out of the water Iohn sawe heaven open and the holy goost descendinge vpon him lyke a dove.

11. And ther came a voyce from heaven: Thou arte my dere sonne in whom I delyte.

12. And immediatly the sprete drave him into wildernes:

13. and he was there in the wildernes xl dayes and was tempted of Satan and was with wilde beestes. And the aungels ministred vnto him.

14. After Iohn was taken Iesus came in to Galile preachinge the gospell of the kyngdome of God

15. and sayinge: the tyme is come and the kyngdome of God is at honde repent and beleve the gospell.

16. As he walked by the see of Galile he sawe Simon and Andrew his brother castinge nettes into ye see for they were fysshers.

17. And Iesus sayde vnto them: folowe me and I will make you fisshers of men.

18. And strayght waye they forsoke their nettes and folowed him.

19. And when he had gone a lytell further thence he sawe Iames the sonne of zebede and Ihon his brother even as they were in the shyppe mendinge their nettes.

20. And anone he called them. And they leeft their father zebede in the shippe with his hyred servauntes and went their waye after him.

21. And they entred into Capernau: and streight waye on ye Saboth dayes he entred in to ye synagoge and taught.

22. And they merveled at his learninge. For he taught them as one that had power with him and not as the Scribes.

23. And there was in their synagoge a ma vexed wt an vnclene spirite yt cried

24. sayinge: let be: what have we to do with the thou Iesus of Nazareth? Arte thou come to destroye vs? I knowe the what thou arte eue that holy of god.

25. And Iesus rebuked him sayinge: hoolde thy peace and come out of him.

26. And ye vnclene spirite tare him and cryed with a loude voyce and came out of him.

27. And they were all amased in so moche that they demaunded one of another amoge them selves saying: what thinge is this? what newe doctryne is this? For he comaundeth the foule spirites with power and they obeye him.

28. And immediatly his fame spreed abroade throughoute all the region borderinge on Galile.

29. And forth with as sone as they were come out of the synagoge they entred into ye housse of Symon and Andrew with Iames and Ihon.

30. And Symons mother in lawe lay sicke of a fever. And anone they tolde him of her.

31. And he came and toke her by the honde and lifte her vp: and the fever forsoke hir by and by: and she ministred vnto them.

32. And at even when the sunne was downe they brought to him all that were diseased and them that were possessed with devyls.

33. And all the cite gaddred to gedder at the dore

34. and he healed many yt were sicke of divers deseases. And he cast out many devyls and suffred not ye devyls to speake because they knewe him.

35. And in the morninge very erly Iesus arose and went out into a solitary place and there prayed.

36. And Simon and they that were with him folowed after him.

37. And when they had founde him they sayde vnto him: all men seke for the.

38. And he sayd vnto them: let vs go into the next tounes that I maye preache there also: for truly I cam out for that purpose.

39. And he preached in their synagoges throughout all Galile and cast the devyls out.

40. And there came a leper to him besechinge him and kneled doune vnto him and sayde to him: yf thou wilt thou canest make me clene.

41. And Iesus had copassion on him and put forth his honde touched him and sayde to him: I will be thou clene.

42. And assone as he had spoke immediatly ye leprosy departed fro him and was clensed.

43. And he charged him and sent him awaye forthwith

44. and sayd vnto him: Se thou saye no thinge to any man: but get the hence and shewe thy silfe to ye preste and offer for thy clensinge those thinges which Moses comaunded for a testimoniall vnto them.

45. But he (assone as he was departed) beganne to tell many thinges and to publyshe the dede: in so moche that Iesus coulde no more opely entre in to the cite but was with out in desert places. And they came to him fro every quarter.

## Mark 2

1. After a feawe dayes he entred into Capernaum agayne and it was noysed that he was in a housse.

2. And anone many gadered to geder in so moche that now there was no roume to receave them: no not so moche as about the dore. And he preached the worde vnto them.

3. And there came vnto him that brought one sicke of the palsie borne of fower men.

4. And because they coulde not come nye vnto him for preace they vncovered ye rofe of the housse where he was. And when they had broken it ope they let doune ye beed where in ye sicke of the palsie laye.

5. When Iesus sawe their fayth he sayde to the sicke of the palsie sonne thy sinnes are forgeven the.

6. And ther were certayne of ye scribes sittinge there and reasoninge in their hertes:

7. how doeth this felowe so blaspheme? Who can forgeve synnes but God only?

8. And immediatly whe Iesus perceaved in his sprete yt they so reasoned in the selves he sayde vnto them: why thynke ye soche thinges in youre hertes?

9. Whether is it easyer to saye to ye sicke of ye palsie thy synnes are forgeven the or to saye aryse take vp thy beed and walke?

10. That ye maye knowe yt the sonne of man hath power in erth to forgeve synnes he spake vnto ye sicke of the palsie:

11. I saye vnto ye aryse and take vp thy beed and get ye hense into thyne awne housse.

12. And by and by he arose toke vp the beed and went forth before them all: in so moche that they were all amased and glorified God sayinge: we never sawe it on this fassion.

13. And he went agayne vnto the see and all the people resorted vnto him and he taught the.

14. And as Iesus passed by he sawe Levy ye sonne of Alphey syt at the receyte of custome and sayde vnto him: folowe me. And he arose and folowed him.

15. And it came to passe as Iesus sate at meate in his housse many publicans and synners sate at meate also with Iesus and his disciples. For there were many that folowed him.

16. And when the Scribes and Pharises sawe him eate with publicas and synnere they sayde vnto his disciples: how is it that he eateth and drynketh with publicas and synners?

17. When Iesus hearde yt he sayde vnto them. The whole have no nede of the phisicio but the sicke. I came not to call the rightwise but the synners to repentaunce.

18. And the disciples of Iohn and the Pharises dyd faste: and therfore came and sayde vnto him. Why do ye disciples of Iohn and of the Pharises faste and thy disciples fast not.

19. And Iesus sayde vnto them: can the chyldren of a weddinge faste while the brydgrome is wt them. As longe as they have the brydgrome with them they cannot faste.

20. But the dayes will come when the brydgrome shalbe taken from them and then shall they faste in those dayes.

21. Also no ma soweth a pece of newe cloth vnto an olde garmet for then taketh he awaye ye newe pece fro the olde and so is the rent worsse.

22. In lyke wyse no man poureth newe wyne into olde vessels: for yf he do the newe wyne breaketh the vessels and the wyne runneth out and the vessels are marred. But new wyne must be poured into new vessels.

23. And it chaunsed that he wet thorow ye corne feldes on the Saboth daye: and his disciples as they went on their waye beganne to plucke the eares of corne.

24. And the Pharises sayde vnto him: beholde why do they on the Saboth dayes yt which is not laufull?

25. And he sayde to them: have ye never rede what David dyd when he had nede and was anhogred bothe he and they that were with him?

26. How he went into the housse of God in the dayes of Abiathar ye hye preste and dyd eate ye halowed loves which is not laufull to eate but for ye prestes only: and gave also to the which were with him?

27. And he sayde to them: the Saboth daye was made for man and not man for the Saboth daye.

28. Wherfore the sonne of man is Lorde eve of the Saboth daye.

## Mark 3

1. And he entred agayne into ye synagoge and there was a man there which had a widdred honde.

2. And they watched him to se whether he wolde heale him on the Saboth daye yt they might accuse him.

3. And he sayde vnto ye man which had ye wyddred honde: arise and stonde in ye middes.

4. And he sayd to them: whether is it laufull to do a good dede on ye Saboth dayes or an evyll? to save life or kyll? But they helde their peace.

5. And he loked round aboute on them angerly mournyge on the blindnes of their hertes and sayde to the man: stretch forth thyne honde. And he stretched it oute. And his honde was restored even as whole as the other.

6. And ye Pharises departed and streyght waye gaddred a counsell with the that belonged to Herode agaynst him yt they might destroye him.

7. And Iesus auoyded wt his disciples to ye sea. And a greate multitude folowed him fro Galile and fro Iurie

8. and fro Hierusalem and fro Idumea and fro beyonde Iordane: and they yt dwelled about Tyre and Sidon a greate multitude: which whe they had herde what thinges he dyd came vnto him.

9. And he comaunded his disciples yt a shippe shuld wayte on him because of the people leste they shuld througe him.

10. For he had healed many in somoche that they preased apon him for to touche him as many as had plages.

11. And when the vnclene sprites sawe him they fell doune before him and cryed sayinge: thou arte the sonne of God.

12. And he straygtly charged them that they shuld not vtter him.

13. And he wet vp into a mountayne and called vnto him whom he wolde and they came vnto him.

14. And he ordeyned ye .xii. that they shuld be wt him and that he myght sende the to preache:

15. and that they might have power to heale syknesses and to cast out devyls.

16. And he gave vnto Simon to name Peter.

17. And he called Iames the sonne of zebede and Iohn Iames brother and gave them Bonarges to name which is to saye the sonnes of thounder.

18. And Andrew and Philip and Bartlemew and Mathew and Thomas and Iames the sonne of Alphey and Taddeus and Symon of Cane

19. and Iudas Iscarioth which same also betrayed him. And they came vnto housse

20. and the people assembled togedder agayne so greatly that they had not leesar so moche as to eate breed.

21. And when they that longed vnto him hearde of it they went out to holde him. For they thought he had bene beside him selfe.

22. And ye Scribes which came fro Ierusalem sayde: he hath Belzebub and by ye power of the chefe devyll casteth out devyls.

23. And he called them vnto him and sayde vnto them in similitudes. How can Satan drive out Satan?

24. For yf a realme be devided ageynste it silfe that realme cannot endure.

25. Or yf a housse be devided agaynste it silfe that housse cannot continue:

26. So yf Sata make insurreccion agaynste himsilfe and be devided he cannot continue but is at an ende.

27. No man can entre into a stronge mans housse and take awaye hys gooddes excepte he fyrst bynde that stronge man and then spoyle hys housse.

28. Verely I saye vnto you all synnes shalbe forgeven vnto mens chyldren and blasphemy wherwith they blaspheme.

29. But he that blasphemeth ye holy goost shall never have forgevenes: but is in dauger of eternall dapnacion:

30. because they sayde he had an vnclene sprete.

31. Then came his mother and his brethre and stode with out and sent vnto him and called him.

32. And the people sate aboute hym and sayde vnto him: beholde thy mother and thy brethre seke for the with out.

33. And he answered them sayinge: who is my mother and my brethre?

34. And he loked rounde about on his disciples which sate in compasse about hym and sayde: beholde my mother and my brethren.

35. For whosoever doeth ye will of God he is my brother my syster and mother.

## Mark 4

1. And he began agayne to teache by the seesyde. And there gadered to gedder vnto him moche people so greatly yt he entred into a ship and sate in the see and all the people was by the seeside on the shoore.

2. And he taught them many thynges in similitudes and sayde vnto them in his doctrine:

3. Herken to. Beholde There wet out a sower to sowe.

4. And it fortuned as he sowed that some fell by the waye syde and the fowles of the ayre came and devoured it vp.

5. Some fell on stony grounde where it had not moche erth: and by and by sprange vp because it had not deepth of erth:

6. but as sone as the sunne was vp it caught heet and because it had not rotynge wyddred awaye.

7. And some fell amonge the thornes and the thornes grewe vp and choked it so that it gave no frute.

8. And some fell vpon good grounde and dyd yelde frute that sproge and grewe and brought forthe: some thirty folde some sixtie folde and some an hundred folde.

9. And he sayde vnto them: he that hath eares to heare let him heare.

10. And when he was alone they yt were aboute him with ye .xii. axed him of ye similitude.

11. And he sayde vnto the. To you it is geve to knowe the mistery of the kyngdome of God. But vnto them that are wt out shall all thinges be done in similitudes:

12. yt when they se they shall se and not discerne: and when they heare they shall heare and not vnderstonde: leste at any tyme they shulde tourne and their synnes shuld be forgeve the.

13. And he sayde vnto the: Perceave ye not this similitude? how then shulde ye vnderstonde all other similitudes?

14. The sower soweth ye worde.

15. And they that are by the wayes syde where the worde is sowen are they to whom assone as they have herde it Satha cometh immediatly and takith awaye the worde that was sowe in their hertes.

16. And likewise they that are sowen on the stonye groude are they: which when they have harde the worde at once receave it wt gladnes

17. yet have no rotes in them selves and so endure but a tyme: and anone as trouble and persecucion aryseth for ye wordes sake they fall immediatly.

18. And they that are sowe amoge the thornes are soche as heare ye worde:

19. and ye care of this worlde and ye disseytfulnes of ryches and the lustes of other thinges entre in and choocke ye worde and it is made vnfrutfull.

20. And those that weare sowe in good grounde are they that heare the worde and receave it and bringe forth frute some thirty folde some sixty folde some an hundred folde.

21. And he sayde vnto them: is ye candle lighted to be put vnder a busshell or vnder ye table and not rather to be put on a cadelstick?

22. For there is nothinge so prevy that shall not be opened: nether so secreet but that it shall come abroade.

23. Yf eny man have eares to heare let him heare.

24. And he sayde vnto them: take hede what ye heare. With what measure ye mete with the same shall it be measured vnto you agayne. And vnto you that heare shall more be geve.

25. For vnto him yt hath shall it be geven: and from him that hath not shalbe taken awaye even that he hath.

26. And he sayde: so is the kyngdome of God even as yf a man shuld sowe seed in ye groude

27. and shulde slepe and ryse vp night and daye: and the seede shuld springe and growe vp he not ware.

28. For ye erth bringeth forthe frute of her silfe: fyrst the blade then the eares after that full corne in the eares.

29. And as sone as the frute is brought forth anone he throusteth in ye sykell because the hervest is come.

30. And he sayde: where vnto shall we lyke the kyngdome of God? or with what copareson shall we copare it?

31. It is lyke a grayne of mustard seed which when it is sowe in the erth is the leest of all seedes that be in the erth:

32. but after that it is sowen it groweth vp and is greatest of all yerbes: and bereth greate brauches so that ye fowles of the ayre maye dwell vnder the shadowe of it.

33. And with many soche similitudes he preached the worde vnto the after as they myght heare it.

34. And with out similitude spake he no thinge vnto them. But when they were aparte he expounded all thinges to his disciples.

35. And the same daye when even was come he sayde vnto them: let vs passe over vnto the other syde.

36. And they lefte the people and toke him even as he was in the shyp. And ther were also with him other shippes.

37. And ther arose a great storme of wynde and dasshed ye waves into the ship so that it was full.

38. And he was in the sterne a slepe on a pelowe. And they awoke him and sayde to him: Master carest thou not yt we perisshe?

39. And he rose vp and rebuked the wynde and sayde vnto the see: peace and be still. And the winde alayed and ther folowed a greate calme.

40. And he sayde vnto them: why are ye so fearfull? How is it that ye have no fayth?

41. And they feared excedingly and sayde one to another: what felowe is this? For booth winde and see obey him.

## Mark 5

1. And they cam over to the other syde of ye see in to the coutre of ye Gaderenites.

2. And when he was come out of ye shippe there met him out of the graves a man possessyd of an vncleane sprete

3. which had his abydinge amoge the graves. And no man coulde bynde him: no not with cheynes

4. because that when he was often bounde wt fetters and cheynes he plucked ye chaynes asundre and brake the fetters in peaces. Nether coulde eny man tame him.

5. And alwayes bothe nyght and daye he cryed in ye moutaynes and in ye graves and bet himsilfe wt stones.

6. When he had spied Iesus afarre of he rane and worshipped him

7. and cryed wt a lowde voyce and sayde: what have I to do wt the Iesus ye sonne of the moost hyest God? I requyre ye in the name of God yt thou tormet me not.

8. For he had sayd vnto hym: come out of the man thou fowle sprete.

9. And he axed him: what is thy name? And he answered sayinge: my name is Legion for we are many.

10. And he prayd him instantly that he wolde not sende the awaye out of the countre.

11. And ther was there nye vnto ye moutayns a greate heerd of swyne fedinge

12. and all the devyls besought him sayinge: sende vs into the heerde of swyne yt we maye enter in to them.

13. And anone Iesus gave them leave. And the vnclene spretes wet out and entred into ye swyne. And the heerd starteled and ran hedling into the see. They were about .ii.M. swyne and they were drouned in the see.

14. And the swyne heerdes fleed and tolde it in ye cyte and in the countre. And they came out for to se what had hapened:

15. and came to Iesus and sawe hym that was vexed wt the fende and had the legio syt both clothed and in his right mynde and were afrayed.

16. And they that sawe it tolde them how it had happened vnto him that was possessed with the devyll: and also of the swyne.

17. And they begane to praye him that he wolde departe fro their coostes.

18. And when he was come in to the shyppe he that had ye devyll prayed him that he myght be with him.

19. Howbeit Iesus wolde not suffre him but sayde vnto him: goo home in to thyne awne housse and to thy frendes and shewe the what great thinges ye Lorde hath done vnto the and how he had copassion on the.

20. And he departed and begane to publisshe in ye ten cyties what greate thinges Iesus had done vnto him and all me dyd merveyle.

21. And when Iesus was come over agayne by shyp vnto the other syde moche people gadered vnto him and he was nye vnto the see.

22. And beholde ther came one of the rulers of ye Synagoge whose name was Iairus: and when he sawe him he fell doune at his fete

23. and besought hym greatly sayinge: my doughter lyith at poynt of deeth I wolde thou woldest come and laye thy honde on her that she myght be safe and live.

24. And he wet with him and moche people folowed him and thronged him.

25. And ther was a certen woman which was diseased of an yssue of bloude .xii. yeres

26. and had suffred many thinges of many phisicios and had spet all yt she had and felte none amendmet at all but wexed worsse and worsse.

27. When she had herde of Iesus: she came into the preace behynde him and touched his garmet.

28. For she thought: yf I maye but touche his clothes I shall be whole.

29. And streyght waye her foutayne of bloude was dryed vp aud she felt in her body that she was healed of the plage.

30. And Iesus immediatly felt in him silfe ye vertue that wet out of him and tourned him roude aboute in the preace and sayde: who touched my clothes?

31. And his disciples sayde vnto him: seist thou ye people thrust the and yet axest who dyd touche me?

32. And he loked roud about for to se her that had done that thinge.

33. The woman feared and trembled (for she knew what was done with in her) and she came and fell doune before him and tolde him ye truth of everythinge.

34. And he sayde to her: Doughter thy fayth hath made the whoale: goo in peace and be whole of thy plage.

35. Whyll he yet spake ther came fro the ruler of ye synagoges housse certayne which sayde: thy doughter is deed: why diseasest thou ye master eny further?

36. Assone as Iesus herde that worde spoke he sayde vnto the ruler of ye synagoge: be not afrayed only beleve.

37. And he suffred no man to folowe him moo then Peter and Iames and Ihon the brother of Iames.

38. And he came vnto the housse of the ruler of ye synagoge and sawe ye wondrynge and them that wepte and wayled greatly

39. and went in and sayde vnto them: why make ye this adoo and wepe? The mayde is not deed but slepith.

40. And they lawght him to scorne. Then he put them all out and toke ye father and the mother of ye mayden and them that were with him and entred in where the mayden laye

41. and toke the mayden by the honde and sayde vnto hyr: Tabitha cumi: which is by interpretacion: mayde I saye vnto the aryse.

42. And streyght the mayden arose and went on her fete. For she was of the age of twelve yeres. And they were astonied at it out of measure.

43. And he charged the straytely that no man shuld knowe of it and comaunded to geve her meate.

## Mark 6

1. And he departed thence and cam into his awne countre and his disciples folowed him.

2. And whe the saboth daye was come he beganne to teache in ye synagsge. And many that hearde him were astonyed and sayde: From whens hath he these thinges? and what wysdo is this that is geve vnto him? and suche vertues yt are wrought by his hondes?

3. Is not this that carpeter Maryes sonne ye brother of Iames and Ioses and of Iuda and Simon? and are not his systers here with vs? And they were offended by him.

4. And Iesus sayde vnto the: a prophet is not despysed but in his awne coutre and amonge his awne kynne and amonge the that are of the same housholde.

5. And he coulde there shewe no miracles but leyd his hondes apon a feawe sicke foolke and healed the.

6. And he merveyled at their vnbelefe. And he went aboute by ye tounes yt laye on every syde teachynge.

7. And he called ye twelve and beganne to sende them two and two and gave them power over vnclene spretes.

8. And comaunded the that they shuld take nothinge vnto their Iorney save a rodde only: Nether scrippe nether breed nether mony in their pourses:

9. but shuld be shood with sandals. And that they shuld not put on two coottes.

10. And he sayd vnto the: whersoever ye entre in to an house there abyde tyll ye departe thence

11. And whosoever shall not receave you nor heare you when ye departe thence shake of the duste that is vnder youre fete for a witnesse vnto them. I saye verely vnto you it shalbe easyer for Zodom and Gomor at the daye of iudgement then for that cite.

12. And they went out and preached that they shuld repent:

13. and they caste out many devylles. And they annoynted many that were sicke with oyle and healed them.

14. And kynge Herode herde of him (for his name was spreed abroade) and sayd: Iohn Baptiste is rysen agayne from deeth and therfore miracles are wrought by him.

15. Wother sayd it is Helyas: and some sayde: it is a Prophet or as one of ye Prophetes.

16. But when Herode hearde of him he sayd: it is Iohn whom I beheded he is rysen from deeth agayne.

17. For Herode him sylfe had sent forth and had taken Iohn and bounde him and cast him into preson for Herodias sake which was his brother Philippes wyfe. For he had maried her.

18. Iohn sayd vnto Herode: It is not laufull for the to have thy brothers wyfe.

19. Herodias layd wayte for him and wolde have killed him but she coulde not.

20. For Herode feared Iohn knowynge yt he was a iuste man and an holy: and gave him reverence: and when he hearde him he dyd many thinges and hearde him gladly.

21. But when a couenient daye was come: Herode on his birth daye made a supper to ye lordes captayns and chefe estates of Galile.

22. And ye doughter of ye sayde Herodias came in and daused and pleased Herode and them that sate at bourde also. Then ye kynge sayd vnto ye mayden: axe of me what thou wilt and I will geve it ye

23. And he sware vnto hyr whatsoever thou shalt axe of me I will geve it ye even vnto ye one halfe of my kyngdome.

24. And she wet forth and sayde to her mother: what shall I axe? And she sayde: Iohn Baptistes heed.

25. And she cam in streygth waye with haste vnto ye kynge and axed sayinge: I will that thou geve me by and by in a charger ye heed of Iohn Baptist.

26. And ye kynge was sory: howbe it for his othes sake and for their sakes which sate at supper also he wolde not put her besyde her purpose.

27. And immediatly ye kynge sent ye hangma and comaunded his heed to be brought in. And he went and beheeded him in the preson

28. and brought his heed in a charger and gave it to the mayden and the mayden gave it to her mother.

29. And when his disciples hearde of it they came and toke vp his body and put it in a toumbe.

30. And the apostels gaddered them selves to ggedre to Iesus and tolde him all thinges booth what they had done and what they had taught.

31. And he sayd vnto them: come ye aparte into the wyldernes and rest awhyle. For there were many comers and goers that they had no leasure so moche as to eate.

32. And he wet by ship out of the waye into a deserte place.

33. But the people spyed them when they departed: and many knewe him and ranne afote thyther out of all cities and cam thyther before them and came togedder vnto him.

34. And Iesus went out and sawe moche people and had compassion on them because they were lyke shepe which had no shepeherde. And he beganne to teache them many thinges.

35. And when ye daye was nowe farre spet his disciples came vnto him sayinge: this is a desert place and now the daye is farre passed

36. let the departe that they maye goo into the countrey rounde about and into the tounes and bye the breed: for they have nothinge to eate.

37. He answered and sayde vnto them: geve ye the to eate. And they sayde vnto him: shall we goo and bye ii.C. penyworth of breed and geve the to eate?

38. He sayde vnto the: how many loves have ye? Goo and loke. And when they had serched they sayde: v. and .ii. fysshes.

39. And he comaunded them to make them all syt doune by companyes apon the grene grasse.

40. And they sate doune here a rowe and there arowe by houndredes and by fyfties.

41. And he toke ye .v. loves and ye ii. fysshes and loked vp to heven and blessed and brake the loves and gave them to his disciples to put before the: and the .ii. fysshes he devyded amonge them all.

42. And they all dyd eate and were satisfied.

43. And they toke vp twelve baskettesfull of the gobbettes and of ye fysshes.

44. And they that ate were about fyve thousand men.

45. And streyght waye he caused his disciples to goo into the shipe and to goo over the water before vnto Bethsaida whyll he sent awaye the people.

46. And assone as he had sent them away he departed into a moutayne to praye.

47. And when even was come the ship was in the middes of the see and he alone on the londe

48. and he sawe the troubled in rowynge for the wynde was cotrary vnto them. And aboute ye fourth quartre of ye nyght he came vnto the walkinge apon the see and wolde have passed by the.

49. When they sawe him walkinge apon the see they supposed it had bene a sprete and cryed oute:

50. For they all sawe him and were afrayed. And anon he talked with them and sayde vnto them: be of good chere it is I be not afrayed.

51. And he went vp vnto them into the shippe and the wynde ceased and they were sore amased in them selves beyonde measure and marveyled.

52. For they remembred not of the loves because their hertes were blynded.

53. And they came over and went into the londe of Genezareth and drue vp into the haven.

54. And assone as they were come out of ye shippe streyght they knewe him

55. and ran forth throughout all ye region rounde about and began to cary aboute in beeddes all yt were sicke to the place where they heard tell yt he was.

56. And whyther soever he entred into tounes cities or villages they layde their sicke in the stretes and prayed him that they myght touche and it were but the edge of his vesture. And as many as touched him were safe.

## Mark 7

1. And ye pharises came togedder vnto him and dyvers of ye scribes which came from Ierusalem.

2. And whe they sawe certayne of his disciples eate breed wt comen hondes (that is to saye wt vnwesshen hondes) they coplayned.

3. For the pharises and all the Iewes excepte they washe their hondes ofte eate not observinge the tradicions of the elders.

4. And whe they come from the market except they washe they eate not. And many other thinges ther be which they have taken apon them to observe as the wasshinge of cuppes and cruses and of brasen vessels and of tables.

5. Then axed him the pharises and sribes why walke not thy disciples accordinge to ye tradicions of the elders but eate breede with vnweshen hondes?

6. He answered and sayde vnto them: well prophesied Esaias of you ypocrites as it is writte: This people honoreth me with their lyppes but their hert is farre from me:

7. In vayne they worshippe me teachinge doctryns which are nothinge but ye comaundementes of men.

8. For ye laye the commaundement of God aparte and observe the tradicions of men as the wesshinge of cruses and of cuppes and many other suche lyke thinges ye do.

9. And he sayde vnto them: well ye cast asyde the comaundement of God to mayntayne youre owne tradicios.

10. For Moses sayde: Honoure thy father and thy mother: and whosoever cursseth father or mother let him dye for it.

11. But ye saye: a man shall saye to father or mother Corban: which is: that thou desyrest of me to helpe the with is geven God.

12. And so ye soffre him no more to do ought for his father or his mother

13. makinge the worde of God of none effecte through youre awne tradicions which ye have ordeyned. And many soche thinges ye do.

14. And he called all the people vnto him and sayde vnto them: Herken vnto me every one of you and vnderstonde.

15. There is no thinge with out a man that can defyle him when it entreth into him: but thoo thinges which procede out of him are those which defyle ye man.

16. If eny man have eares to heare let him heare

17. And whe he came to house awaye fro the people his disciples axed him of the similitude.

18. And he sayd vnto the: Are ye so without vnderstondinge? Do ye not yet perceave yt whatsoever thinge from wt out entreth into a man it can not defyle him

19. because it entrith not in to his hert but into ye belly: and goeth out into the draught that porgeth oute all meates.

20. And he sayde: yt defileth a ma which cometh oute of a man.

21. For fro wt in even oute of the herte of men proceade evill thoughtes: advantry fornicacion murder

22. theeft coveteousnes wickednes diceyte vnclennes and a wicked eye blasphemy pryde folysshnes:

23. all these evyll thinges come from with in and defile a man.

24. And from thence he rose and went into ye borders of Tyre and Sidon and entred into an housse and wolde that no man shnld have knowen: But he coulde not be hyd.

25. For a certayne woma whose doughter had a foule sprete hearde of him and came and fell at his fete.

26. The woman was a Greke oute of Syrophenicia and she besought him yt he wolde caste out ye devyll oute of her doughter.

27. And Iesus sayde vnto her: let the chyldren fyrst be feed. For it is not mete to take the chyldres breed and to caste it vnto whelppes.

28. She answered and sayde vnto him: even soo master neverthelesse the whelppes also eate vnder the table of the chyldrens cromes.

29. And he sayde vnto her: for this sayinge goo thy waye the devyll is gone out of thy doughter.

30. And when she was come home to her housse she founde the devyll departed and her doughter lyinge on the beed.

31. And he departed agayne from the coostes of Tyre and Sidon and came vnto the see of Galile thorowe ye middes of the coostos of ye .x. cities.

32. And they brought vnto him one yt was deffe and stambred in his speche and prayde him to laye his honde apon him.

33. And he toke him asyde from ye people and put his fyngers in his eares and dyd spyt and touched his tounge

34. and loked vp to heven and sygthed and sayde vnto him: ephatha that is to saye be openned.

35. And streyght waye his eares were openned and the stringe of his tounge was loosed and he spake playne.

36. And he comaunded them that they shuld tell no man. But the more he forbad them soo moche the more a greate deale they publesshed it:

37. and were beyonde measure astonyed sayinge: He hath done all thinges well and hath made booth the deffe to heare and the dome to speake.

## Mark 8

1. In those dayes whe ther was a very greate companye and had nothinge to eate Iesus called his disciples to him and sayd vnto the:

2. I have copassion on this people because they have nowe bene with me .iii. dayes and have nothinge to eate:

3. And yf I shuld sende the awaye fastinge to their awne houses they shulde faynt by the waye. For dyvers of the came from farre.

4. And his disciples answered him: where shuld a man have breade here in the wildernes to satisfie these?

5. And he axed them: how many loves have ye? They sayde: seven.

6. And he commaunded the people to syt doune on the grounde. And he toke the .vii. loves gave thankes brake and gave to his disciples to set before them. And they dyd set the before the people.

7. And they had a feawe smale fysshes. And he blessed them and comaunded them also to be set before them.

8. And they ate and were suffysed: And they toke vp yf the broken meate that was lefte .vii. baskettes full.

9. And they yt ate were in nomber aboute fowre thousand. And he sent them awaye.

10. And a none he entred into a ship wt his disciples and came into the parties of Dalmanutha.

11. And the pharises cam forth and begane to dispute with him sekinge of him a signe fro heven and temptinge him.

12. And he sygthed in his sprete and sayde: why doth this generacion seke a signe? Verely I saye vnto you ther shall no signe be geven vnto this generacion.

13. And he lefte the and went into the ship agayne and departed over the water.

14. And they had forgotte to take breed wt the nether had they in the ship with them more then one loofe.

15. And he charged the sayinge. Take hede and beware of ye leven of ye pharises and of ye leve of Herode.

16. And they reasoned amonge the selves sayinge: we have no breed

17. And whe Iesus knewe yt he sayde vnto the: why take ye thought because ye have no bread? perceave ye not yet nether vnderstonde? Have ye youre hertes yet blynded?

18. Have ye eyes and se not? and have ye eares and heare not? Do ye not remember?

19. When I brake v. loves amonge .v.M. How many baskettes full of broke meate toke ye vp? They sayde vnto him twelve.

20. When I brake .vii. amonge .iiii. M. How many basketes of the levinges of broken meate toke ye vp? they sayde .vii.

21. And he sayde vnto the: how is it yt ye vnderstonde not?

22. And he came to Bethsaida and they brought a blynde man vnto him and desyred him to touche him.

23. And he caught the blynde by the honde and leade him out of the toune and spat in his eyes and put his hondes apon him and axed him whether he saw ought.

24. And he loked vp and sayde: I se ye men: For I se the walke as they were trees.

25. After that he put his hondes agayne apon his eyes and made him see. And he was restored to his sight and sawe every ma clerly.

26. And he sent him home to his housse sayinge: nether goo into the toune nor tell it to eny in the toune.

27. And Iesus went out and his disciples into the tounes that longe to the cite called Cesarea Philippi. Aud by the waye he axed his disciples sayinge: whom do men saye yt I am?

28. And they answered: some saye that thou arte Iohn Baptiste: some saye Helyas: and some one of the Prophetes.

29. And he sayde vnto the: But whom saye ye that I am? Peter answered and sayd vnto him: Thou arte very Christe.

30. And he charged them that they shuld tell no man of it.

31. And he beganne to teache them how that the sonne of man must suffre many thinges and shuld be reproved of the elders and of the hye prestes and scribes and be kylled and after thre dayes aryse agayne.

32. And he spake that sayinge openly. And Peter toke him asyde and began to chyde him.

33. Then he tourned aboute and looked on his disciples and rebuked Peter sayinge: Goo after me Satan. For thou saverest not ye thinges of God but the thinges of men.

34. And he called the people vnto him with his disciples also and sayd vnto them: Whosoever will folowe me let him forsake him sylfe and take vp his crosse and folowe me.

35. For whosoever will save his lyfe shall lose it But whosoever shall lose his lyfe for my sake and ye gospels ye same shall save it.

36. What shall it profet a ma yf he shuld wynne all ye worlde and loose his awne soule?

37. or els what shall a ma geve to redeme his soule agayne?

38. Whosoever therfore shall be asshamed of me and of my wordes amonge this advoutrous and sinfull generacion: of him shall the sonne of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father wt the holy angels.

## Mark 9

1. And he sayde vnto them: Verely I saye vnto you: There be some of the that stonde here which shall not taste of deeth tyll they have sene the kyngdome of God come wt power.

2. And after .vi. dayes Iesus toke Peter Iames and Iohn and leede them vp into an hye mountayne out of ye waye alone and he was transfigured before them.

3. And his rayment dyd shyne and was made very whyte even as snowe: so whyte as noo fuller can make apon the erth.

4. And ther apered vnto them Helyas with Moses: and they talked with Iesu.

5. And Peter answered and sayde to Iesu: Master here is good beinge for vs let vs make .iii. tabernacles one for the one for Moses and one for Helyas.

6. And yet he wist not what he sayde: for they were afrayde.

7. And ther was a cloude that shaddowed the. And a voyce came out of the cloude sayinge: This is my dere sonne here him.

8. And sodenly they loked rounde aboute them and sawe no man more then Iesus only wt the.

9. And as they came doune from the hyll he charged the that they shuld tell no ma what they had sene tyll the sonne of man were rysen fro deeth agayne.

10. And they kepte that sayinge with them and demaunded one of a nother what yt rysinge from deeth agayne shuld meane?

11. And they axed him sayinge: why then saye ye scribe that Helyas muste fyrste come?

12. He answered and sayde vnto them: Helyas verelye shall fyrst come and restore all thinges. And also ye sonne of ma as it is wrytte shall suffre many thinges and shall be set at nought.

13. Moreouer I saye vnto you that Helyas is come and they have done vnto him whatsoever pleased them as it is wrytten of him.

14. And he came to his disciples and sawe moche people aboute them and the scribes disputinge with them.

15. And streyght waye all the people when they behelde him were amased and ran to him and saluted him.

16. And he sayde vnto the Scribes: what dispute ye with them?

17. And one of the copanye answered and sayde: Master I have brought my sonne vnto the which hath a dome spirite.

18. And whensoever he taketh him he teareth him and he fometh and gnassheth with his tethe and pyneth awaye. And I spake to thy disciples that they shuld caste him out and they coulde not.

19. He answered him and sayd: O generacion wt out faith how longe shall I be with you? How longe shall I suffre you? Bringe him vnto me.

20. And they brought him vnto him. And assone as ye sprete sawe him he tare him. And he fell doune on the grounde walowinge and fomynge.

21. And he axed his father: how longe is it a goo sens this hath happened him? And he sayde of a chylde:

22. and ofte tymes casteth him into the fyre and also into the water to destroye him. But yf thou canste do eny thinge have mercy on vs and helpe vs.

23. And Iesus sayde vnto him: ye yf thou couldest beleve all thinges are possible to him yt belevith.

24. And streygth waye the father of the chylde cryed with teares sayinge: Lorde I beleve helpe myne vnbelefe.

25. When Iesus sawe that the people came runnynge togedder vnto him he rebuked the foule sprete sayinge vnto him: Thou domme and deffe sprete I charge the come out of him and entre no more into him.

26. And the sprete cryed and rent him sore and came out: And he was as one that had bene deed in so moche yt many sayde he is deed.

27. But Iesus caught his honde and lyfte him vp: and he roose.

28. And when he was come into the housse his disciples axed him secretly: why coulde not we caste him out?

29. And he sayde vnto them: this kynde can by no nother meanes come forth but by prayer and fastynge.

30. And they departed thens and toke their iorney thorow Galile and he wolde not that eny man shuld have knowen it.

31. For he taught his disciples and sayde vnto them: The sonne of man shalbe delyvered into ye hondes of men and they shall kyll him and after that he is kylled he shall aryse agayne the thryd daye.

32. But they wiste not what that sayinge meat and were affrayed to axe him.

33. And he came to Capernaum. And when he was come to housse he axed the: what was it that ye disputed bytwene you by the waye?

34. And they helde their peace: for by the waye they reasoned amonge the selves who shuld be the chefest.

35. And he sate doune and called the twelve vnto him and sayd to them: yf eny man desyre to be fyrst the same shalbe last of all and servaunt vnto all.

36. And he toke a chylde and set him in ye middes of them and toke him in his armes and sayde vnto them.

37. Whosoever receave eny soche a chylde in my name receaveth me. And whosoever receaveth me receaveth not me but him that sent me.

38. Iohn answered him sayinge: Master we sawe one castynge out devyls in thy name which foloweth not vs and we forbade him because he foloweth vs not.

39. But Iesus sayde forbid him not. For ther is no ma that shall do a miracle in my name that can lightlyge speake evyll of me.

40. Whosoever is not agaynste you is on youre parte.

41. And whosoever shall geve you a cuppe of water to drinke for my names sake because ye belonge to Christe verely I saye vnto you he shall not loose his rewarde.

42. And whosoever shall offende one of these lytelons yt beleve in me it were better for him yt a mylstone were hanged aboute his necke and yt he he were cast into ye see:

43. wherfore yf thy hande offende ye cut him of. It is better for ye to entre into lyffe maymed then havynge two hondes goo into hell into fire yt never shalbe quenched

44. where there worme dyeth not and the fyre never goeth oute.

45. Lykewyse yf thy fote offende the cut him of. For it is better for the to goo halt into lyfe then havynge two fete to be cast into hell into fyre that never shalbe quenched:

46. where there worme dyeth not and the fyre never goeth oute.

47. Even so yf thyne eye offende the plucke him oute. It is better for the to goo into the kyngdom of god with one eye then havynge two eyes to be caste into hell fyre:

48. where there worme dyeth not and the fyre never goeth oute.

49. Every man therfore shalbe salted wt fyre: And every sacrifise shalbe seasoned with salt.

50. Salt is good. But yf ye salt be vnsavery: what shall ye salte therwith? Se yt ye have salt in youre selves: and have peace amonge youre selves one with another.

## Mark 10

1. And he rose from thence and went into ye coostes of Iurie through the region yt is beyonde Iordan. And ye people resorted vnto him afresshe: and as he was wont he taught them agayne.

2. And the pharises came and axed him a question: whether it were laufull for a ma to put awaye his wyfe: to prove him.

3. And he answered and sayd vnto the: what dyd Moses byd you do?

4. And they sayde: Moses suffred to wryte a testimoniall of devorsement and to put hyr awaye.

5. And Iesus answered and sayd vnto the: For ye hardnes of youre hertes he wrote this precept vnto you.

6. But at the fyrste creacion God made the man and woman.

7. And for this thinges sake shall ma leve his father and mother and bide by his wyfe

8. and they twayne shalbe one flesshe. So then are they now not twayne but one flesshe.

9. Therfore what God hath cuppled let not ma separat.

10. And in the housse his disciples axed him agayne of yt matter.

11. And he sayde vnto them: Whosoever putteth awaye his wyfe and maryeth another breaketh wedlocke to her warde.

12. And yf a woman forsake her husband and be maryed to another she comitteth advoutrie.

13. And they brought chyldren to him that he should touche the. And his disciples rebuked thoose that brought the.

14. When Iesus sawe that he was displeased and sayd to the: Suffre the chyldre to come vnto me and forbid the not. For of suche is ye kyngdome of God.

15. Verely I saye vnto you whosoever shall not receave ye kyngdome of God as a chylde he shall not entre therin.

16. And he toke the vp in his armes and put his hondes vpon them and blessed the.

17. And when he was come in to the waye ther came one runninge and kneled to him and axed him: good master what shall I do that I maye enheret eternall lyfe?

18. Iesus sayde to him: why callest thou me good? There is no ma good but one which is God.

19. Thou knowest the comaundementes: breake not matrimony: kyll not: steale not: bere not falce wytnes: defraude no man: honoure thy father and mother.

20. He answered and sayde to him: master all these I have observed fro my youth.

21. Iesus behelde him and had a favour to him and sayde vnto him: one thynge is lackinge vnto the. Goo and sell all that thou hast and geve to the povre and thou shalt have treasure in heven and come and folowe me and take vp thy crosse.

22. But he was discuforted with yt sayinge and wet awaye morninge for he had greate possessions.

23. And Iesus loked rounde aboute and sayde vnto his disciples: what an harde thinge is it for them that have riches to entre into the kyngdome of God.

24. And his disciples were astonneyd at his wordes. But Iesus answered agayne and sayde vnto them: chyldre how harde is it for them that trust in riches to entre in to the kyngdome of God.

25. It is easyer for a camell to go thorowe ye eye of an nedle then for a riche man to entre into the kyngdome of God.

26. And they were astonnyed out of measure sayinge betwene them selves: who then can be saved?

27. Iesus loked vpon them and sayde: with men it is vnpossible but not with God: for with God all thynges are possible.

28. And Peter begane to saye vnto him: Lo we have forsaken all and have folowed the.

29. Iesus answered and sayde: Verely I saye vnto you ther is no man that forsaketh housse or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wyfe other chyldren or londes for my sake and the gospelles

30. which shall not receave an houndred foolde nowe in this lyfe: houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and chyldren and londes with persecucions: and in the worlde to come eternall lyfe.

31. Many that are fyrst shalbe last: and the last fyrst.

32. And they were in ye waye goinge vp to Ierusalem. And Iesus wet before them: and they were amased and as they folowed were affrayde. And Iesus toke ye .xii. agayne and begane to tell the what thinges shuld happe vnto him.

33. Beholde we goo vp to Ierusalem and the sonne of man shalbe delyvered vnto the hye preestes and vnto the Scribes: and they shall condempne him to deeth and shall delyvre him to the gentyls:

34. and they shall mocke hym and scourge him and spit vpo hym and kyll him. And the thirde daye he shall ryse agayne.

35. And then Iames and Iohn ye sonnes of zebede came vnto him sayinge: master we wolde that thou shuldest do for vs what soever we desyre.

36. He sayde vnto them: what wolde ye I shuld do vnto you?

37. They sayd to him: graut vnto vs that we maye sitte one on thy right honde and the other on thy lyfte honde in thy glory.

38. But Iesus sayd vnto the: Ye wot not what ye axe. Can ye dryncke of the cup that I shall dryncke of and be baptised in ye baptime that I shalbe baptised in?

39. And they sayde vnto him: that we can. Iesus sayde vnto them: ye shall dryncke of the cup that I shall dryncke of and be baptised with the baptyme that I shalbe baptised in:

40. but to sit on my right honde and on my lyfte honde ys not myne to geve but to them for whom it is prepared.

41. And when the .x. hearde that they bega to disdayne at Iames and Iohn.

42. But Iesus called the vnto him and sayde to them: ye knowe that they which seme to beare rule amonge the gentyls raygne as lordes over the. And they that be greate amoge them exercyse auctorite over them.

43. So shall it not be amonge you but whosoever of you wilbe greate amoge you shalbe youre minister.

44. And whosoever wilbe chefe shalbe servaunt vnto all.

45. For eve the sonne of man came not to be ministred vnto: but to minister and to geve his lyfe for the redempcion of many.

46. And they came to Hierico. And as he went oute of Hierico with his disciples and a greate nobre of people: Barthimeus ye sonne of Thimeus which was blinde sate by ye hye wayes syde begginge.

47. And when he hearde that it was Iesus of Nazareth he began to crye and to saye: Iesus the sonne of David have mercy on me.

48. And many rebuked him yt he shuld holde is peace. But he cryed the moore a greate deale thou sonne of David have mercy on me.

49. And Iesus stode still and commaunded hym to be called. And they called the blinde sayinge vnto him: Be of good conforte: ryse he calleth the.

50. And he threwe awaye his clooke and roose and came to Iesus.

51. And Iesus answered and sayde vnto hym: what wilt thou that I do vnto the? The blynde sayde vnto hym: master that I myght see.

52. Iesus sayde vnto him: goo thy waye thy faith hath saved the. And by and by he receaved his sight and folowed Iesus in the waye.

## Mark 11

1. And when they came nye to Hierusalem vnto Bethphage and Bethanie besydes mout olivete he sent forth two of his hisciples

2. and sayde vnto the: Goo youre wayes into the toune that is over agaynst you. And assone as ye be entred into it ye shall fynde a coolte bounde wheron never man sate: loose him and bringe him.

3. And if eny man saye vnto you: why do ye soo? Saye that the Lorde hath neade of him: and streight waye he will sende him hidder.

4. And they wet their waye and foud a coolte tyed by the dore with out in a place where two wayes met and they losed him.

5. And divers of the that stode there sayde vnto the: what do ye loosinge ye coolte?

6. And they sayd vnto them eve as Iesus had comaunded the. And they let them goo.

7. And they brought ye coolte to Iesus and caste their garmetes on him: and he sate vpo him.

8. And many sprede there garmetes in the waye. Other cut doune brauches of the trees and strawed them in ye waye.

9. And they yt went before and they that folowed cryed sayinge: Hos anna: blessed be he that cometh in ye name of ye Lorde.

10. Blessed be ye kingdome that cometh in ye name of him yt is Lorde of oure father David. Hos anna in ye hyest.

11. And ye Lorde entred in to Ierusalem and into the teple. And when he had loked roudabout vpon all thinges and now ye eve tyde was come he went out vnto Bethany with ye twelve.

12. And on the morowe when they were come out fro Bethany he hungred

13. and spyed a fygge tree a farre of havinge leves and wet to se whether he myght finde eny thinge ther on. But when he came therto he foude no thinge but leves: for the tyme of fygges was not yet.

14. And Iesus answered and sayde to it: never man eate frute of the here after whill ye worlde stondith. And his disciples hearde it.

15. And they came to Ierusalem. And Iesus wet into the teple and begane to cast out ye sellers and byers in the teple and overthrewe the tables of the money chaungers and the stoles of them that solde doves:

16. and wolde not suffre that eny man caried a vessell thorow the temple.

17. And he taught sayinge vnto them is it not written: my housse shalbe called the housse of prayer vnto all nacions? But ye have made it a deen of theves.

18. And the Scribes and hye prestes hearde yt and sought howe to distroye him. For they feared him because all the people marveled at his doctrine.

19. And when eve was come he went out of the cite.

20. And in the mornynge as they passed by they sawe the fygge tree dryed vp by ye rotes.

21. And Peter remembred and sayde vnto him: master beholde the fygge tree which thou cursedest is widdred awaye.

22. And Iesus answered and sayde vnto them: Have confides in God.

23. Verely I saye vnto you that whosoever shall saye vnto this mountayne: take awaye thy silfe and cast thy silfe in to the see and shall not waver in his herte but shall beleve yt those thinges which he sayeth shall come to passe what soever he sayeth shalbe done to him.

24. Therfore I saye vnto you what soever ye desyre when ye praye beleve yt ye shall have it and it shalbe done vnto you.

25. And when ye stod and praye forgeve yf ye have eny thinge agaynste eny man yt youre father also which is in heve maye forgeve you youre trespases.

26. And they came agayne to Hierusalem. And as he walked in the teple ther came to him ye hye prestes and the Scribes and the elders

27. and sayd vnto him: by what auctorite doest thou these thinges? and who gave the this auctorite to do these thinges?

28. Iesus answered and sayde vnto them: I will also axe of you a certayne thinge: and answere ye me and I wyll tell you by what auctorite I do these thinges.

29. The baptyme of Iohn was it from heven or of men? Answer me.

30. And they thought in them selves sayinge: yf we shall saye from heven: he will saye why then dyd ye not beleve him?

31. but if we shall saye of me: then feare we ye people. For all men counted Iohn that he was a verie Prophete.

32. And they answered and sayd vnto Iesu: we cannot tell. And Iesus answered and sayd vnto them: nether wyll I tell you by what auctorite I do these thynges.

## Mark 12

1. And he beganne to speake vnto them in similitudes. A certayne man planted a vineyarde and copased it with an hedge and ordeyned a wyne presse and bylt a toure in yt. And let yt out to hyre vnto husbandme and went into a straunge countre.

2. And when the tyme was come he sent to the tennauntes a servaunt that he myght receave of the tenauntes of the frute of the vyneyarde.

3. And they caught him and bet him and sent him agayne emptye.

4. And moreoever he sent vnto them another servaunt and at him they cast stones and brake his heed and sent him agayne all to revyled.

5. And agayne he sent another and him they kylled: and many other beetynge some and kyllinge some.

6. Yet had he one sonne whom he loved tenderly him also he sent at the last vnto them sayinge: they wyll feare my sonne.

7. But the tenauntes sayde amongest them selves: this is the heyre: come let vs kyll hym and ye inheritauce shalbe oures.

8. And they toke him and kyllid him and cast him out of the vyneyarde.

9. What shall then the lorde of the vyneyarde do? He will come and destroye ye tenauntes and let out the vyneyarde to other.

10. Have ye not redde this scripture? The stoone which ye bylders dyd refuse is made ye chefe stoone in ye corner:

11. this was done of ye Lorde and is mervelous in oure eyes.

12. And they went about to take him but they feared the people. For they perceaved that he spake that similitude agaynst them. And they left him and went their waye.

13. And they sent vnto him certayne of ye Pharises with Herodes servantes to take him in his wordes.

14. And assone as they were come they sayd vnto him: master we knowe yt thou arte true and carest for no man: for thou consyderest not the degre of men but teachest the waye of God truly: Ys it laufull to paye tribute to Cesar or not?

15. Ought we to geve or ought we not to geve? He vnderstode their simulacion and sayde vnto them: Why tepte ye me? Brynge me a peny that I maye se yt.

16. And they brought. And he sayde vnto them: Whose ys thys ymage and superscripcion? And they sayde vnto him Cesars.

17. And Iesus answered and saide vnto the: Then geve to Cesar that which belongeth to Cesar: and to God that which perteyneth to God. And they mervelled at him.

18. Then came the Saduces vnto him which saye ther is no resurreccion. And they axed hym sayinge:

19. Master Moses wroote vnto vs yf eny mans brother dye and leve his wyfe behinde him and leve no chyldren: that then hys brother shuld take his wyfe and reyse vp seed vnto his brother.

20. Ther were seven brethren: and the fyrst toke a wyfe and when he dyed leeft no seed behynde him.

21. And the seconde toke hir and dyed: nether leeft eny seed. And the thyrde lyke wyse.

22. And seve had her and leeft no seed behynde them. Last of all the wyfe dyed also.

23. In the resurreccio then when they shall ryse agayne: whose wyfe shall she be of them? For seven had her to wyfe.

24. Iesus answered and sayde vnto them: Are ye not therfore deceaved and vnderstonde not the scryptures nether the power of God?

25. For when they shall ryse agayne fro deeth they nether mary nor are maryed: but are as the angels which are in heven.

26. As touchynge the deed that they shall ryse agayne: have ye not redde in the boke of Moses howe in the busshe God spake vnto him sayinge: I am the God of Abraham and God of Ysaac and the God of Iacob?

27. He is not the God of the deed but the God of the livynge. Ye are therfore greatly deceaved.

28. And ther came one of the scribes that had hearde them disputynge to gedder and perceaved that he had answered them well and axed him: Which is the fyrste of all the commaundemetes?

29. Iesus answered him: the fyrste of all the comaundementes is. Heare Israel: The Lorde God is one Lorde.

30. And thou shalt love the Lorde thy God with all thy hert and with all thy soule and with all thy mynde and with all thy strength. This is the fyrste commaundement.

31. And the seconde is lyke vnto this: Thou shalt love thy neghbour as thy silfe. Ther is none other commaundement greater then these.

32. And the Scribe sayde vnto him: well master thou hast sayd ye truthe that ther ys one God and that ther is none but he.

33. And to love him with all the herte and with all the mynde and with all the soule and with all the stregth: and to love a mans neghbour as him silfe ys a greater thinge then all burntofferings and sacrifices.

34. And when Iesus sawe that he answered discretly he sayde vnto him: Thou arte not farre from the kyngdome of God. And no man after that durst axe him eny questio.

35. And Iesus answered and sayde teachynge in the temple: how saye the Scribes yt Christ is the sonne of David?

36. for David him selfe inspyred with the holy goost sayde: The Lorde sayde to my Lorde syt on my right honde tyll I make thyne enemyes thy fote stole.

37. Then David hym silfe calleth him Lorde: and by what meanes is he then his sonne? And moche people hearde him gladly.

38. And he sayde vnto them in his doctrine: beware of the Scribes which love to goo in longe clothinge: and love salutacions in ye market places

39. and the chefe seates in the synagoges and to syt in the vppermost roumes at feastes

40. and devoure widowes houses and that vnder coloure of longe prayinge. These shall receave greater dampnacion.

41. And Iesus sat over agaynst the treasury and behelde how the people put money in to the treasury. And many that were ryche cast in moch.

42. And ther cam a certayne povre widowe and she threwe in two mytes which make a farthynge.

43. And he called vnto him his disciples and sayde vnto them: Verely I saye vnto you that this pover widowe hath cast moare in then all they which have caste into the treasury.

44. For they all dyd cast in of their superfluyte: but she of her poverte dyd cast in all that she had eve all her livynge.

## Mark 13

1. And as he went out of the teple one of his disciples sayde vnto him: Master se what stones and what byldynges are here.

2. And Iesus answered and sayde vnto him: Seist thou these greate byldinges? There shall not be leefte one stone vpon a another that shall not be throwen doune.

3. And as he sate on moute olivete over agest the teple Peter and Iames and Iohn and Andrew axed him secretly:

4. tell vs when shall these thinges be? And what is ye signe whe all these thinges shalbe fulfilled?

5. And Iesus answered the and bega to saye: take hede lest eny man deceave you.

6. For many shall come in my name sayinge: I am Christ and shall deceave many.

7. When ye shall heare of warre and tydinges of warre be ye not troubled. For soche thinges muste nedes be. But the ende is not yet.

8. For ther shall nacion aryse agaynste nacion and kyngdome agaynst kyngdome. And ther shalbe erth quakes in all quarters and famyshment and troubles. These are the begynnynge of sorowes.

9. But take ye hede to youre selves. For they shall bringe you vp to ye counsels and into ye synagoges and ye shalbe beaten: ye and shalbe brought before rulers and kynges for my sake for a testimoniall vnto them.

10. And the gospell must fyrste be publysshed amoge all nacions.

11. But when they leade you and present you toke noo thought afore honde what ye shall saye nether ymagion: but whatsoever is geve you at the same tyme that speake. For it shall not be ye that shall speake but ye holy goost.

12. Ye and the brother shall delyvre the brother to deeth and the father the sonne and the chyldre shall ryse agaynste their fathers and mothers and shall put them to deeth.

13. And ye shalbe hated of all men for my names sake. But whosoever shall endure vnto the ende the same shalbe safe.

14. Moreover whe ye se the abhominacio that betokeneth desolacion wherof is spoken by Daniel the Prophet stonde where it ought not let him that redeth vnderstonde. Then let them that be in Iurie fle to the mountaynes.

15. And let him that is on the housse toppe not descende doune into the housse nether entre therin to fetche eny thinge oute of his housse.

16. And let hym that is in the felde not tourne backe agayne vnto the thinges which he leeft behynde him for to take his cloothes with him.

17. Woo is then to them that are wt chylde and to them that geve soucke in thoose dayes.

18. But praye that youre flyght be not in the wynter.

19. For ther shalbe in those dayes suche tribulacion as was not from the begynninge of creatures which God created vnto this tyme nether shalbe.

20. And excepte yt the Lorde shuld shorten those dayes no ma shuld be saved. But for the electes sake which he hath chosen he hath shortened those dayes.

21. And then yf eny man saye to you: loo here is Christ: loo he is there beleve not.

22. For falce Christes shall aryse and falce Prophetes and shall shewe myracles and wondres to deceave yf it were possible evyn the electe.

23. But take ye hede: beholde I have shewed you all thinges before.

24. Moreover in thoose dayes after that tribulacio the sunne shall wexe darke and the mone shall not geve her light

25. and the starres of heven shall fall: and the powers wich are in heven shall move.

26. And then shall they se the sonne of man comynge in the cloudes with greate power and glory.

27. And then shall he sende his angels and shall gaddre to gedder his electe from the fower wyndes and from the one ende of the worlde to the other.

28. Learne a similitude of ye fygge tree. When his braunches are yet tender and hath brought forthe leves ye knowe that sommer is neare.

29. So in lyke maner when ye se these thinges come to passe: vnderstond that it ys nye even at the dores.

30. Verely I saye vnto you yt this generacion shall not passe tyll all these thinges be done.

31. Heven and erth shall passe but my wordes shall not passe.

32. But of the daye and the houre knoweth no ma: no not the angels which are in heven: nether the sonne him silfe save the father only.

33. Take hede watche and praye for ye knowe not when the tyme ys.

34. As a man which is gone in to a straunge countrey and hath lefte hys housse and geven auctorite to his servautes and to every man hys worke and commaunded the porter to watche.

35. Watche therfore for ye knowe not when the master of ye housse will come whether at eve or at mydnyght whether at the cocke crowynge or in the daunynge:

36. lest yf he come sodenly he shuld fynde you slepynge.

37. And that I saye vnto you I saye vnto all men watche.

## Mark 14

1. After two dayes folowed ester and the dayes of swete breed. And the hye prestes and the Scrybes sought meanes how they myght take hym by crafte and put him to deeth.

2. But they sayde: not in the feast daye leest eny busynes aryse amonge the people.

3. When he was in Bethania in the housse of Simon the leper even as he sate at meate ther came a woma hauynge an alablaster boxe of oyntment called narde that was pure and costly: and she brake the boxe and powred it on is heed.

4. And ther were some that were not content in them selves and sayde: what neded this waste of oyntment?

5. For it myght have bene soolde for more then thre hundred pens and bene geve vnto the poore. And they grudged agaynste hir.

6. And Iesus sayde: let hir be in reest why trouble ye hir? She hath done a good worke on me.

7. For ye shall have poore with you all wayes: and when soever ye will ye maye do them good: but me ye shall not have alwayes.

8. She hath done that she coulde: she came a fore honde to anoynt my boddy to his buryinge warde.

9. Verely I saye vnto you: wheresoever this gospell shalbe preached thorowout the whole worlde: thys also that she hath done shalbe rehearsed in remembraunce of her.

10. And Iudas Iscarioth one of the twelve went awaye vnto the hye prestes to betraye hym vnto them.

11. When they herde that they were gladde and promised yt they wolde geve him money. And he sought howe he myght conveniently betraye him.

12. And the fyrste daye of swete breed when men offer ye pascall lambe his disciples sayd vnto him: where wilt thou that we goo and prepare that thou mayst eate the ester lambe?

13. And he sent forth two of his disciples and sayde vnto them: Goo ye into the cyte and ther shall a man mete you beringe a pitcher of water folowe him.

14. And whither soever he goeth in saye ye to ye good man of ye housse: the master axeth where is the geest chambre where I shall eate ye ester lambe with my disciples.

15. And he will shewe you a greate parlour paved and prepared: there make ready for vs.

16. And his disciples went forth and came to the cyte and founde as he had sayd vnto them: and made ready the ester lambe.

17. And at even he came with the .xii.

18. And as they sate at borde and ate Iesus sayde: Verely I saye vnto you: that one of you shall betraye me which eateth with me.

19. And they begane to morne and to saye to him one by one: ys it I? And a nother sayde: ys it I?

20. He answered and sayde vnto them: It ys one of the .xii. and the same deppeth with me in the platter.

21. The sonne of man goeth as it ys written of him: but woo be to that man by whome the sonne of man is betrayed. Good were it for him if that man had never bene borne.

22. And as they ate Iesus toke breede blessed and brake and gave to them and sayde: Take eate this ys my body.

23. And he toke the cup gave thankes and gave it to them and they all dranke of it.

24. And he sayde vnto them: This is my bloude of the new testament which is sheed for many.

25. Verely I saye vnto you: I will drinke no moore of this frute of the vyne vntyll that daye that I drinke it new in the kyngdome of God.

26. And when they had sayd grace they went out to mount Olyvete.

27. And Iesus sayde vnto them: All ye shalbe offended thorow me this nyght. For it is wrytte: I will smyte ye shepeherd and the shepe shalbe scattered.

28. But after that I am rysen agayne I will goo into Galile before you.

29. Peter sayde vnto him: And though all men shuld be offended yet wolde not I.

30. And Iesus sayd vnto him: Verely I saye vnto ye this daye even in this nyght before ye cocke crowe twyse thou shalt denye me thryse.

31. And he spake boldlyer: no yf I shulde dye wt the I will not deny the. Lyke wyse also sayd they all.

32. And they came into a place named Gethsemani. And he sayde to his disciples: Syt ye here whyll I goo aparte and praye.

33. And he toke with him Peter Iames and Iohn and he began to waxe abasshed and to be in an agonye

34. and sayde vnto the: My soule is very hevy even vnto the deeth tary here and watche.

35. And he went forth a lytle and fell doune on ye grounde and prayed: that yf it were possible the houre myght passe from him.

36. And he sayd: Abba father all thinges are possible vnto the take awaye this cup from me. Neverthelesse not that I will but that thou wilt be done.

37. And he cam and founde the slepinge and sayd to Peter: Simon slepest thou? Couldest not thou watche with me one houre?

38. watche ye and praye leest ye entre into temptacion: ye sprete is redy but ye flessh is weeke.

39. And agayne he went awaye and prayde and spake ye same wordes.

40. And he returned and founde them a slepe agayne for their eyes were hevy: nether wist they what to answere him.

41. And he cam the thyrde tyme and sayd vnto the: slepe hens forth and take youre ease it is ynough. The houre is come beholde ye sonne of man shalbe delyvered into ye hondes of synners.

42. Ryse vp let vs goo. Loo he that betrayeth me is at hande.

43. And immediatly whyll he yet spake came Iudas one of the twelve and with him a greate nomber of people with sweardes and staves from the hye prestes and scribes and elders.

44. And he that betrayed him had geven them a generall toke sayinge: whosoever I do kisse he it is: take him and leade him awaye warely.

45. And assone as he was come he went streyght waye to him and sayd vnto him: master master and kissed him.

46. And they layde their hondes on him and toke him.

47. And one of them that stode by drue out a swearde and smote a servaunt of the hye preste and cut of his eare.

48. And Iesus answered and sayd vnto the: ye be come out as vnto a thefe wt sweardes and with staves for to take me.

49. I was dayly with you in ye temple teachinge and ye toke me not: but yt the scriptures shuld be fulfilled.

50. And they all forsoke him and ranne awaye.

51. And ther folowed him a certeyne yonge man cloothed in lynnen apon ye bare and the yongemen caught him

52. and he lefte his lynnen and fleed from them naked.

53. And they leed Iesus awaye to ye hyest preste of all and to him came all the hye prestes and the elders and the scribes.

54. And Peter folowed him a greate waye of even into the pallys of the hye preste and sat with the servauntes and warmed him sylfe at the fyre.

55. And the hye prestes and all ye counsell sought for witnes agaynste Iesu to put him to death and founde noone.

56. Yet many bare falce witnes agaynste him but their witnes aggreed not to geder.

57. And ther aroose certayne and brought falce witnes agaynste him sayinge.

58. We herde him saye: I will destroye this temple made with hondes and with in thre dayes I will bylde another made with out hondes.

59. But their witnes agreed not to geder.

60. And the hyeste preste stode up amongest them and axed Iesus sayinge: answerest thou nothinge? How is it that these beare witnes agaynst the?

61. And he helde his peace and answered noothinge. Agayne the hyeste Preste axed him and sayde vnto him: Arte thou Christ the sonne of the blessed?

62. And Iesus sayde: I am. And ye shall se the sonne of man syt on the ryght honde of power and come in the cloudes of heven.

63. Then the hyest preste rent his cloothes and sayd: what nede we eny further of witnes?

64. Ye have herde the blasphemy what thinke ye? And they all gave sentence yt he was worthy of deeth.

65. And some begane to spit at him and to cover his face and to bete him with fistes and to saye vnto him arede vnto vs. And the servauntes boffeted him on the face.

66. And as Peter was beneeth in ye pallys ther came one of ye weches of ye hyest preste:

67. and whe she saw Petre warmynge him sylfe she loked on him and sayd: wast not thou also wt Iesus of Nazareth?

68. And he denyed it sayinge: I knowe him not nether wot I what thou sayest. And he went out into ye poorche and the cocke crewe.

69. And a damsell sawe him and agayne beganne to saye to the that stode by this is one of the.

70. And he denyed it agayne. And anone after they that stode by sayde agayne to Peter: suerly thou arte one of the for thou arte of Galile and thy speache agreth therto.

71. And he beganne to cursse and to sweare sayinge: I knowe not this man of whom ye speake.

72. And agayne the cocke krewe and Peter remembred the worde that Iesus sayd vnto him: before the cocke crowe twyse thou shalt deny me thryse and beganne to wepe.

## Mark 15

1. And anone in ye dawnynge the hye prestes helde counsell wt ye elders and ye scribes and ye whoole cogregacion and bounde Iesus and ledde him awaye and delivered him to Pilate.

2. And Pilate axed him: arte thou the kynge of the Iewes? And he answered and sayde vnto him: thou sayest it.

3. And the hye prestes accused him of many thinges.

4. Wherfore Pilate axed him agayne sayinge: Answerest thou nothinge? Beholde how many thinges they lay vnto thy charge.

5. Iesus yet answered never aworde so that Pilate merveled.

6. At that feast Pilate was wont to delivre at their pleasure a presoner: whomsoever they wolde desyre.

7. And ther was one named Barrabas which laye bounde with the that made insurreccion and in the insurreccion comitted murther.

8. And ye people called vnto him and began to desyre accordinge as he had ever done vnto them.

9. Pylate answered them and sayd: Will ye that I lowse vnto you the kynge of the Iewes?

10. For he knewe that the hye Prestes had delyvered him of envy.

11. But the hye prestes had moved the people that he shuld rather delyvre Barrabas vnto them.

12. And Pylate answered agayne and sayd vnto the: What will ye then that I do wt him whom ye call ye kynge of ye Iewes?

13. And they cryed agayne: crucifie him.

14. Pylate sayde vnto them: What evell hath he done? And they cryed ye moore fervently: crucifie him.

15. And so Pylate willinge to content the people lowsed them Barrabas and delyvered Iesus when he had scourged him for to be crucified.

16. And the souddeers ledde him awaye into ye commen hall and called togedder the whoole multitude

17. and they clothed him with purple and they platted a croune of thornes and crouned him with all

18. and beganne to salute him. Hayle kynge of the Iewes.

19. And they smoote him on the heed wt a rede and spat apon him and kneled doune and worsheped him.

20. And when they had moocked him they toke the purple of him and put his awne cloothes on him and ledde him oute to crucifie him.

21. And they compelled one that passed by called Symon of Cyrene (which cam oute of the felde and was father of Alexander and Rufus) to beare his crosse.

22. And they brought him to a place named Golgotha (which is by interpretacion the place of deed mens scoulles)

23. and they gave him to drinke wyne myngled with myrte but he receaved it not.

24. And when they had crucified him they parted his garmentes castinge loottes for them what every man shulde have.

25. And it was aboute ye thyrde houre and they crucified him.

26. And the tytle of his cause was wrytten: The kynge of the Iewes.

27. And they crucified with him two theves: the one on the ryght honde and the other on his lyfte.

28. And the scripture was fulfilled which sayeth: he was counted amonge the wicked.

29. And they that went by rayled on him: waggynge their heedes and sayinge: A wretche that destroyest the temple and byldest it in thre dayes:

30. save thy sylfe and come doune from the crosse.

31. Lyke wyse also mocked him ye hye preestes amonge them selves with the scribes and sayde: He saved other men him sylfe he cannot save.

32. Let Christ the kynge of Israel now descende from the crosse that we maye se and beleve. And they that were crucified with him checked him also.

33. And when the sixte houre was come darknes aroose over all the erth vntyll ye nynthe houre.

34. And at the nynthe houre Iesus cryed with a loude voyce sayinge: Eloi Eloi lamaasbathani which is yf it be interpreted: my God my God why hast thou forsaken me?

35. And some of them that stode by when they hearde yt sayde: beholde he calleth for Helyas

36. And one ran and filled a sponge full of veneger and put it on a rede and gave him to drinke sayinge: let him alone let vs se whether Helyas will come and take him doune.

37. But Iesus cryed with aloude voyce and gave vp the gooste.

38. And the vayle of the temple dyd rent in two peces from the toppe to the boottome.

39. And when the Centurion which stode before him sawe that he so cryed and gave vp the gooste he sayd: truly this man was the sonne of God.

40. Ther were also wemen a good waye of beholdinge him: amonge whom was Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of Iames the lytle and of Ioses and Mary Salome

41. which also when he was in Galile folowed him and ministred vnto him and many other wemen which came vp with him to Hierusalem.

42. And now when nyght was come (because it was ye even that goeth before ye saboth)

43. Ioseph of Arimathia a noble councelour which also loked for ye kyngdome of God came and went in booldly vnto Pylate and begged ye boddy of Iesu.

44. And Pylate merveled that he was alredy deed and called vnto him ye Centurion and axed of him whether he had bene eny whyle deed.

45. And when he knewe the trueth of the Centurion he gave ye body to Ioseph.

46. And he bought a lynnen cloothe and toke him doune and wrapped him in ye lynnen cloothe and layde him in a tombe yt was hewen oute of ye rocke and rolled a stone vnto the doze of the sepulcre.

47. And Mary Magdalen and Mary Ioses beheld where he was layde.

## Mark 16

1. And when ye saboth daye was past Mary Magdalen and Mary Iacobi and Salome bought odures that they myght come and anoynt him.

2. And erly in the morninge the nexte daye after the saboth day they came vnto the sepulcre when the sunne was rysen.

3. And they sayd one to another: who shall rolle vs awaye the stone from the dore of the sepulcre?

4. And when they looked they sawe how the stone was rolled awaye: for it was a very greate one.

5. And they went into the sepulcre and sawe a yonge man syttinge on the ryght syde cloothed in a longe whyte garmet and they were abasshed.

6. And he sayd vnto the be not afrayed: ye seke Iesus of Nazareth which was crucified. He is rysen he is not here. Beholde the place where they put him.

7. But go youre waye and tell his disciples and namely Peter: he will goo before you into Galile: there shall ye se him as he sayde vnto you.

8. And they went oute quickly and fleed from the sepulcre. For they trembled and were amased. Nether sayd they eny thinge to eny man for they were afrayed.

9. When Iesus was rysen the morow after ye saboth daye he appered fyrst to Mary Magdalen oute of whom he cast seven devyls.

10. And she wet and toolde them that were with him as they morned and weapte.

11. And when they herde that he was alyve and he had appered to hyr they beleved it not.

12. After that he appered vnto two of them in a straunge figure as they walked and went into the country.

13. And they went and toolde it to the remnaunt. And they beleved them nether.

14. After that he appered vnto the eleve as they sate at meate: and cast in their tethe their vnbelefe and hardnes of herte: be cause they beleued not them which had sene him after his resurreccio.

15. And he sayd vnto them: Goo ye in to all the worlde and preache the glad tyges to all creatures

16. he that beleueth and is baptised shall be saved. But he that beleveth not shalbe dampned.

17. And these signes shall folowe them that beleve: In my name they shall cast oute devyls and shall speake with newe tonges

18. and shall kyll serpentes. And yf they drinke eny dedly thinge yt shall not hurte the. They shall laye their hondes on ye sicke and they shall recover.

19. So then when the lorde had spoken vnto them he was receaued into heauen and is set doune on the ryght honde of God.

20. And they went forth and preached every where. And the Lorde wrought with them and confirmed the worde with miracles that folowed.
