## Genesis 1

1. In the begynnynge God created heaven and erth.

2. The erth was voyde and emptie ad darcknesse was vpon the depe and the spirite of god moved vpon the water

3. Than God sayd: let there be lyghte and there was lyghte.

4. And God sawe the lyghte that it was good: and devyded the lyghte from the darcknesse

5. and called the lyghte daye and the darcknesse nyghte: and so of the evenynge and mornynge was made the fyrst daye

6. And God sayd: let there be a fyrmament betwene the waters ad let it devyde the waters a sonder.

7. Than God made the fyrmament and parted the waters which were vnder the fyrmament from the waters that were above the fyrmament: And it was so.

8. And God called the fyrmament heaven And so of the evenynge and morninge was made the seconde daye

9. And God sayd let the waters that are vnder heaven gather them selves vnto one place that the drye londe may appere: And it came so to passe.

10. And god called the drye lande the erth and the gatheringe togyther of waters called he the see. And God sawe that it was good

11. And God sayd: let the erth bringe forth herbe and grasse that sowe seed and frutefull trees that bere frute every one in his kynde havynge their seed in them selves vpon the erth. And it came so to passe:

12. ad the erth brought forth herbe and grasse sowenge seed every one in his kynde and trees berynge frute and havynge their seed in the selves every one in his kynde. And God sawe that it was good:

13. and the of the evenynge and mornynge was made the thyrde daye.

14. Than sayd God: let there be lyghtes in ye firmament of heaven to devyde the daye fro the nyghte that they may be vnto sygnes seasons days and yeares.

15. And let them be lyghtes in the fyrmament of heave to shyne vpon the erth. and so it was.

16. And God made two great lyghtes A greater lyghte to rule the daye and a lesse lyghte to rule the nyghte and he made sterres also.

17. And God put them in the fyrmament of heaven to shyne vpon the erth

18. and to rule the daye and the nyghte ad to devyde the lyghte from darcknesse. And god sawe yt it was good:

19. and so of the evenynge ad mornynge was made the fourth daye.

20. And God sayd let the water bryng forth creatures that move and have lyfe and foules for to flee over the erth vnder the fyrmament of heaven.

21. And God created greate whalles and all maner of creatures that lyve and moue which the waters brought forth in their kindes ad all maner of federed foules in their kyndes. And God sawe that it was good:

22. and God blessed them saynge. Growe and multiplye ad fyll the waters of the sees and let the foules multiplye vpo the erth.

23. And so of the evenynge and morninge was made the fyfth daye.

24. And God sayd: leth the erth bring forth lyvynge creatures in thir kyndes: catell and wormes and beastes of the erth in their kyndes and so it came to passe.

25. And god made the beastes of the erth in their kyndes and catell in their kyndes ad all maner wormes of the erth in their kyndes: and God sawe that it was good.

26. And God sayd: let vs make man in oure symilitude ad after oure lycknesse: that he may have rule over the fysh of the see and over the foules of the ayre and over catell and over all the erth and over all wormes that crepe on the erth.

27. And God created man after hys lycknesse after the lycknesse of god created he him: male and female created he them.

28. And God blessed them and God sayd vnto them. Growe and multiplye and fyll the erth and subdue it and have domynyon over the fysh of the see and over the foules of the ayre and over all the beastes that move on the erth.

29. And God sayd: se I have geven yow all herbes that sowe seed which are on all the erth and all maner trees that haue frute in them and sowe seed: to be meate for yow

30. and for all beastes of the erth and vnto all foules of the ayre and vnto all that crepeth on the erth where in is lyfe that they may haue all maner herbes and grasse for to eate and even so it was.

31. And God behelde al that he had made ad loo they were exceadynge good: and so of the evenynge and mornynge was made the syxth daye

## Genesis 2

1. Thus was heave and erth fynished wyth all their apparell:

2. ad i ye seueth daye god ended hys worke which he had made and rested in ye seventh daye fro all his workes which he had made.

3. And God blessed ye seventh daye and sanctyfyed it for in it he rested from all his workes which he had created and made.

4. These are the generations of heaven and erth when they were created in the tyme when the LORde God created heaven and erth

5. and all the shrubbes of the felde be fore they were in the erthe. And all the herbes of the felde before they sprange: for the LORde God had yet sent no rayne vpon the erth nether was there yet any man to tylle the erth.

6. But there arose a myste out of the ground and watered all the face of the erth:

7. Then the LORde God shope man even of the moulde of the erth and brethed into his face the breth of lyfe. So man was made a lyvynge soule.

8. The LORde God also planted a garden in Eden from the begynnynge and there he sette man whom he had formed.

9. And the LORde God made to sprynge out of the erth all maner trees bewtyfull to the syghte and pleasant to eate and the tree of lyfe in the middes of the garden: and also the tree of knowlege of good and euell.

10. And there spronge a rever out of Eden to water the garden and thence devided it selfe and grewe in to foure principall waters.

11. The name of the one is Phison he it is that compasseth all the lande of heuila where gold groweth.

12. And the gold of that contre ys precious there is found bedellion and a stone called Onix.

13. The name of the seconde ryver is Gihon which compassyth all the lande of Inde.

14. And the name of the thyrde river is Hidekell which runneth on the easte syde of the assyryans And the fourth river is Euphrates.

15. And the LORde God toke Adam and put him in the garden of Eden to dresse it and to kepe it:

16. and the LORde God comaunded Ada saynge: of all the trees of the garde se thou eate.

17. But of the tre of knowlege of good and badd se that thou eate not: for even ye same daye thou eatest of it thou shalt surely dye.

18. And the LORde God sayd: it is not good that man shulde be alone I will make hym an helper to beare him company:

19. And after yt the LORde God had make of the erth all maner beastes of the felde and all maner foules of the ayre he brought them vnto Adam to see what he wold call them. And as Ada called all maner livynge beastes: eve so are their names.

20. And Adam gave names vnto all maner catell and vnto the foules of the ayre and vnto all maner beastes of the felde. But there was no helpe founde vnto Adam to beare him companye

21. Then the LORde God cast a slomber on Adam and he slepte. And then he toke out one of his rybbes and in stede ther of he fylled vp the place with flesh.

22. And the LORde God made of the rybbe which he toke out of Adam a woma and brought her vnto Adam.

23. Then sayd Ada this is once bone of my boones and flesh of my flesh. This shall be called woman: because she was take of the man.

24. For this cause shall a man leve father and mother and cleve vnto his wyfe and they shall be one flesh.

25. And they were ether of them naked both Adam and hys wyfe ad were not ashamed:

## Genesis 3

1. But the serpent was sotyller than all the beastes of the felde which ye LORde God had made and sayd vnto the woman. Ah syr that God hath sayd ye shall not eate of all maner trees in the garden.

2. And the woman sayd vnto the serpent of the frute of the trees in the garden we may eate

3. but of the frute of the tree yt is in the myddes of the garden (sayd God) se that ye eate not and se that ye touch it not: lest ye dye.

4. Then sayd the serpent vnto the woman: tush ye shall not dye:

5. But God doth knowe that whensoever ye shulde eate of it youre eyes shuld be opened and ye shulde be as God and knowe both good and evell.

6. And the woman sawe that it was a good tree to eate of and lustie vnto the eyes and a pleasant tre for to make wyse. And toke of the frute of it and ate and gaue vnto hir husband also with her and he ate.

7. And the eyes of both them were opened that they vnderstode how that they were naked. Than they sowed fygge leves togedder and made them apurns.

8. And they herd the voyce of the LORde God as he walked in the garde in the coole of the daye. And Adam hyd hymselfe and his wyfe also from the face of the LORde God amonge the trees of the garden.

9. And the LORde God called Adam and sayd vnto him where art thou?

10. And he answered. Thy voyce I harde in the garden but I was afrayd because I was naked and therfore hyd myselfe.

11. And he sayd: who told the that thou wast naked? hast thou eaten of the tree of which I bade the that thou shuldest not eate?

12. And Adam answered. The woman which thou gavest to bere me company she toke me of the tree ad I ate.

13. And the LORde God sayd vnto the woman: wherfore didest thou so? And the woman answered the serpent deceaved me and I ate.

14. And the LORde God sayd vnto the serpet because thou haste so done moste cursed be thou of all catell and of all beastes of the feld: vppo thy bely shalt thou goo: and erth shalt thou eate all dayes of thy lyfe.

15. Morover I will put hatred betwene the and the woman and betwene thy seed and hyr seed. And that seed shall tread the on the heed ad thou shalt tread hit on the hele.

16. And vnto the woman he sayd: I will suerly encrease thy sorow ad make the oft with child and with payne shalt thou be deleverd: And thy lustes shall pertayne vnto thy husbond and he shall rule the.

17. And vnto Ada he sayd: for as moch as thou hast obeyed the voyce of thy wyfe and hast eaten of the tree of which I commaunded the saynge: se thou eate not therof: cursed be the erth for thy sake. In sorow shalt thou eate therof all dayes of thy lyfe

18. And it shall beare thornes ad thystels vnto the. And thou shalt eate the herbes of ye feld:

19. In the swete of thy face shalt thou eate brede vntill thou returne vnto the erth whece thou wast take: for erth thou art ad vnto erth shalt thou returne.

20. And Ada called his wyfe Heua because she was the mother of all that lyveth

21. And the LORde God made Adam and hys wyfe garmentes of skynnes and put them on them.

22. And the LORde God sayd: loo Adam is become as it were one of vs in knowlege of good and evell. But now lest he strech forth his hand and take also of the tree of lyfe and eate and lyve ever.

23. And the LORde God cast him out of the garden of Eden to tylle the erth whece he was taken.

24. And he cast Ada out and sette at ye enteringe of the garden Eden Cherubin with a naked swerde movinge in and out to kepe the way to the tree of lyfe.

## Genesis 4

1. And Adam lay wyth Heua ys wyfe which conceaved and bare Cain and sayd: I haue goten a ma of the LORde.

2. And she proceded forth and bare hys brother Abell: And Abell became a sheperde And Cain became a ploweman.

3. And it fortuned in processe of tyme that Cain brought of the frute of the erth: an offerynge vnto the LORde.

4. And Abell he brought also of the fyrstlynges of hys shepe and of the fatt of them. And the LORde loked vnto Abell and to his offeynge:

5. but vnto Cain and vnto his offrynge looked he not. And Cain was wroth exceadingly and loured.

6. And the LORde sayd vnto Cain: why art thou angry and why loureste thou? Wotest thou not yf thou dost well thou shalt receave it?

7. But and yf thou dost evell by and by thy synne lyeth open in the dore. Not withstondyng let it be subdued vnto the ad see thou rule it.

8. And Cain talked wyth Abell his brother.And as soone as they were in the feldes Cain fell vppon Abell his brother and slewe hym

9. And ye LORde sayd vnto Cain: where is Abell thy brother? And he sayd: I can not tell am I my brothers keper?

10. And he sayd: What hast thou done? the voyce of thy brothers bloud cryeth vnto me out of the erth.

11. And now cursed be thou as pertaynyng to the erth which opened hyr mouth to receaue thy brothers bloud of thyne hande.

12. For when thou tyllest the grounde she shall heceforth not geve hyr power vnto the. A vagabunde and a rennagate shalt thou be vpon the erth.

13. And Cain sayd vnto the LORde: my synne is greater then that it may be forgeven.

14. Beholde thou castest me out thys day from of the face of the erth and fro thy syghte must I hyde my selfe ad I must be wandrynge and a vagabunde vpon the erth: Morover whosoever fyndeth me wyll kyll me,

15. And the LORde sayd vnto hi Not so but whosoever sleyth Cain shalbe punyshed .vij. folde. And ye LORde put a marke vpo Cain that no ma yt founde hym shulde kyll hym.

16. And Cain went out fro the face of the LORde and dwelt in the lande Nod on the east syde of Eden.

17. And Cain laye wyth hys wyfe which conceaved and bare Henoch. And he was buyldinge a cyte and called the name of it after the name of hys sonne Henoch.

19. And Lamech toke hym two wyves: the one was called Ada and the other Zilla.

20. And Ada bare Iabal of whome came they that dwell in tentes ad possesse catell.

21. And hys brothers name was Iubal: of hym came all that excercyse them selves on the harpe and on the organs

22. And Zilla she also bare Tubalcain a worker in metall and a father of all that grave in brasse and yeron. And Tubalcains syster was called Naema.

23. Then sayd Lamech vnto hys wyves Ada ad Zilla: heare my voyce ye wyves of Lamech and herken vnto my wordes for I haue slayne a man and wounded my selfe and haue slayn a yongman and gotte my selfe strypes:

24. For Cain shall be avenged sevenfolde: but Lamech seventie tymes sevenfolde.

25. Adam also laye with hys wyfe yet agayne and she bare a sonne ad called hys name Seth For god (sayd she) hath geven me a nother sonne For Abell whom Cain slewe.

8. But yet Noe found grace in the syghte of the LORde.

9. These are the generatios of Noe. Noe was a righteous man and vncorrupte in his tyme and walked wyth god.

10. And Noe begat .iij. sonnes: Sem Ham and Iapheth.

11. And the erth was corrupte in the syghte of god and was full of mischefe.

12. And God loked vpon the erth ad loo it was corrupte: for all flesh had corrupte his way vppon the erth.

13. Than sayd God to Noe: the end of all flesh is come before me for the erth is full of there myschefe. And loo I wyll destroy them with the erth.

14. Make the an arcke of pyne tree and make chaumbers in the arcke and pytch it wythin and wythout wyth pytch.

16. A wyndow shalt thou make aboue in the arcke. And wythin a cubyte compasse shalt thou finysh it.And the dore of the arcke shalt thou sette in ye syde of it: and thou shalt make it with .iij loftes one aboue an other.

17. For behold I wil bringe in a floud of water apon the erth to destroy all flesh from vnder heaven wherin breth of life is so that all that is in the erth shall perish.

18. But I will make myne apoyntement with the that both thou shalt come in to ye arcke and thy sonnes thy wyfe and thy sonnes wyves with the.

19. And of all that lyveth what soever flesh it be shalt thou brynge in to the arcke of every thynge a payre to kepe them a lyve wyth the. And male and female

4. For .vij. dayes hence wyll I send rayne vppo the erth .xl. dayes and .xl. nyghtes and wyll dystroy all maner of thynges that I haue made from of the face of the erth..

5. And Noe dyd acordynge to all yt the lorde comaunded hym:

7. and Noe went and his sonnes and his wyfe and his sonnes wyves wyth hym in to the arke from the waters of the floud.

8. And of clene beastes and of beastes that ware vnclene and of byrdes and of all that crepeth vppo the erth

9. came in by cooples of every kynde vnto Noe in to the arke: a male and a female: even as God commaunded Noe.

10. And the seventh daye the waters of the floud came vppon the erth.

11. In the .vi. hundred yere of Noes lyfe in the secode moneth in the .xvij daye of the moneth yt same daye were all the founteynes of the grete depe broken vp and the wyndowes of heave were opened

12. ad there fell a rayne vpon the erth .xl. dayes and .xl. nyghtes.

13. And the selfe same daye went Noe Sem Ham and Iapheth Noes sonnes and Noes wyfe and the .iij. wyues of his sonnes wyth them in to the arke:

14. both they and all maner of beastes in their kide and all maner of catell in their kynde and all maner of wormes that crepe vppon the erth in their kynde and all maner of byrdes in there kynde. and all maner off foules what soever had feders.

15. And they came vnto Noe in to the arke by cooples of all flesh yt had breth of lyfe in it.

16. And they that came came male ad female of every flesh acordige as God comaunded hym: and ye LORde shytt the dore vppo him

17. And the floud came .xl. dayes and .xl. nyghtes vppon the erth and the water increased and bare vp the arcke ad it was lifte vp from of the erth

18. And the water prevayled and increased exceadingly vppon the erth: and the arke went vppo he toppe of the waters.

19. And the waters prevayled excedingly above mesure vppo the erth so that all the hye hylles which are vnder all the partes of heaven were covered:

20. eve .xv. cubytes hye prevayled the waters so that the hylles were covered.

21. And all fleshe that moved on the erth bothe birdes catell and beastes perisshed with al that crepte on the erth and all men:

22. so that all that had the breth of liffe in the nostrels of it thorow out all that was on drye lond dyed.

23. Thus was destroyed all that was vppo the erth both man beastes wormes and foules of the ayre so that they were destroyed from the erth: save Noe was reserved only and they that were wyth hym in the arke.

24. And the waters prevayled vppon the erth an hundred and fyftye dayes.

## Genesis 8

1. And god remebred Noe and all ye beastes and all ye catell yt were with hi in ye arke And god made a wynde to blow vppo ye erth and ye waters ceased:

2. ad ye fountaynes of the depe ad the wyndowes of heave were stopte and the rayne of heaven was forbidde

3. and the waters returned from of ye erth ad abated after the ende of an hundred and .l. dayes.

4. And the arke rested vppo the mountayns of Ararat the .xvij. daye of the .vij. moneth.

5. And the waters went away ad decreased vntyll the x. moneth. And the fyrst daye of the tenth moneth the toppes of the mounteyns appered.

6. And after the ende of .xl. dayes. Noe opened the wyndow of the arke which he had made

7. ad sent forth a raven which went out ever goinge and cominge agayne vntyll the waters were dreyed vpp vppon the erth

8. Then sent he forth a doue from hym to wete whether the waters were fallen from of the erth.

9. And when the doue coude fynde no restinge place for hyr fote she returned to him agayne vnto the arke for the waters were vppon the face of all the erth. And he put out hys honde and toke her and pulled hyr to hym in to the arke

10. And he abode yet .vij. dayes mo and sent out the doue agayne out of the arke

11. And the doue came to hym agayne aboute eventyde and beholde: There was in hyr mouth a lefe of an olyve tre which she had plucked wherby Noe perceaved that the waters wer abated vppon the erth.

12. And he taried yet .vij. other dayes and sent forth the doue which from thence forth came no more agayne to him.

13. And it came to passe the syxte hundred and one yere and the fyrst daye of the fyrst moneth that the waters were dryed vpp apon the erth. And Noe toke off the hatches of the arke and loked: And beholde the face of the erth was drye.

14. so by the .xxvij. daye of the seconde moneth the erth was drye.

15. And God spake vnto Noe saynge:

16. come out of the arcke both thou and thy wyfe ad thy sonnes and thy sonnes wyues with the.

17. And all the beastes that are with the whatsoever flesh it be both foule and catell and all maner wormes that crepe on the erth brynge out with the and let them moue growe ad multiplye vppon the erth.

18. And Noe came out ad his sonnes and his wyfe and his sonnes wyues with hym.

19. And all the beastes and all the wormes and all the foules and all that moved vppon the erth came also out of the arke all of one kynde together.

20. And Noe made an aulter vnto the LORDE and toke of all maner of clene beastes and all maner of clene foules and offred sacrifyce vppon the aulter.

21. And the LORDE smellyd a swete savoure and sayd in his hert: I wyll henceforth no more curse the erth for mannes sake for the imagynacion of mannes hert is evell even from the very youth of hym. Morover I wyll not destroy from henceforth all that lyveth as I haue done.

22. Nether shall sowynge tyme and harvest colde and hete somere and wynter daye and nyghte ceasse as longe as the erth endureth.

3. And all that moveth vppon the erth havynge lyfe shall be youre meate: Euen as ye grene herbes so geue I yow all thynge.

4. Only the flesh with his life which is his bloud se that ye eate not.

5. For verely the bloude of yow wherein youre lyves are wyll I requyre: Eue of the hande of all beastes wyll I requyre it And of the hande of man and of the hand off euery mannes brother wyll I requyre the lyfe of man:

6. so yt he which shedeth mannes bloude shall haue hys bloud shed by man agayne: for God made man after his awne lycknesse.

11. I make my bonde wyth yow that hence forth all flesh shall not be destroyed wyth yt waters of any floud ad yt hence forth there shall not be a floud to destroy the erth.

12. And God sayd. This is the token of my bode which I make betwene me and yow ad betwene all lyvynge thyng that is with yow for ever:

13. I wyll sette my bowe in the cloudes and it shall be a sygne of the appoyntment made betwene me and the erth:

14. So that when I brynge in cloudes vpo ye erth the bowe shall appere in ye cloudes.

15. And than wyll I thynke vppon my testament which I haue made betwene me and yow and all that lyveth what soeuer flesh it be. So that henceforth there shall be no more waters to make a floud to destroy all flesh.

16. The bowe shalbe in the cloudes and I wyll loke vpon it to remembre the euerlastynge testament betwene God and all that lyveth vppon the erth what soeuer flesh it be.

17. And God sayd vnto Noe: This is the sygne of the testament which I have made betwene me and all flesh yt is on the erth.

26. And he sayd: Blessed be the LORde God of Se and Canaan be his seruante.

27. God increase Iapheth that he may dwelle in the tentes of Sem. And Canaan be their seruante.

1. And the LORde apeared vnto him in the okegrove of Mamre as he sat in his tent doze in the heate of the daye.

2. And he lyfte vp his eyes and looked: ad lo thre men stode not farr from hym. And whe he sawe them he ran agenst them from the tent dore and fell to the grounde

3. and sayde: LORde yf I haue founde fauoure in thy syght goo not by thi seruaunte.

4. Let a litle water be fett and wash youre fete and rest youre selves vnder the tree:

5. And I will fett a morsell of breed to comforte youre hartes wythall. And tha goo youre wayes for even therfore ar ye come to youre servaunte. And they answered: Do even so as thou hast sayde.

6. And Abraha went a pace in to his tent vnto Sara ad sayde: make redy att once thre peckes of fyne meale kneade it and make cakes.

7. And Abraham ran vnto his beastes and fett a calfe that was tendre and good and gaue it vnto a yonge man which made it redy attonce.

8. And he toke butter and mylcke and the calfe which he had prepared and sett it before them and stode hymselfe by them vnder the tree: and they ate.

9. And they sayde vnto him: Where is Sara thy wife? And he sayde: in the tent.

10. And he sayde: I will come agayne vnto the as soone as the frute can lyue. And loo: Sara thy wife shall haue a sonne. That herde Sara out of the tent doore which was behind his backe.

11. Abraham and Sara were both olde and well stryken in age and it ceased to be with Sara after the maner as it is wyth wyves.

12. And Sara laughed in hir selfe saynge: Now I am waxed olde shall I geue my selfe to lust and my lorde olde also?

13. Than sayd the LORde vnto Abraha: wherfore doth Sara laughe saynge: shal I of a suertie bere a childe now when I am olde?

14. is the thinge to harde for the LORde to do? In the tyme appoynted will I returne vnto the as soone as the frute can haue lyfe And Sara shall haue a sonne.

15. Than Sara denyed it saynge: I laughed not for she was afrayde. But he sayde: yes thou laughtest.

16. Than the men stode vp from thence ad loked towarde Sodome. And Abraham went with them to brynge them on the waye.

17. And the LORde sayde: Can I hyde from Abraham that thinge which I am aboute to do

18. seynge that Abraham shall be a great ad a myghtie people and all the nations of the erth shalbe blessed in him?

19. For I knowe him that he will commaunde his childern and his housholde after him yt they kepe the waye of the LORde to do after righte and conscyence that the LORde may brynge vppon Abraham that he hath promysed him.

20. And the LORde sayde? The crie of Sodome and Gomorra is great and there synne is excedynge grevous.

21. I will go downe and see whether they haue done all to gedder acordynge to that crye which is come vnto me or not that I may knowe.

22. And the me departed thece and went to Sodomeward. But Abraham stode yet before ye LORde

23. and drewe nere and saydeWylt thou destroy the rightwes with the wyked?

24. Yf there be .l. rightwes within the cyte wilt thou destroy it and not spare the place for the sake of .l. rightwes that are therin?

25. That be farre from the that thou shuldest do after thys maner to sley the rightwes with the weked ad that the rightwes shulde be as the weked: that befarre from the. Shulde not the iudge of all ye worlde do acordynge to righte?

26. And the LORde sayde: Yf I fynde in Sodome .l. rightwes within the cyte I will spare all the place for their sakes.

27. And Abraham answered and sayde: beholde I haue taken vppon me to speake vnto ye LORde ad yet am but dust ad asshes.

28. What though there lacke .v. of .l. rightwes wylt thou destroy all the cyte for lacke of .v? And he sayde: Yf I fynde there .xl. and .v. I will not destroy them.

29. And he spake vnto him yet agayne and sayde: what yf there be .xl. foude there: And he sayde: I wyll not do it for forties sake.

30. And he sayde: O let not my LORde be angrye that I speake. What yf there be foude .xxx. there? And he sayde: I will not do it yf I finde .xxx. there.

31. And be sayde: Oh se I haue begonne to speake vnto my LORde what yf there be .xx. founde there? And he sayde: I will not distroy the for tweties sake.

32. And he sayde: O let not my LORde be angrye that I speake yet but eue once more only. What yf ten be founde there?. And he sayde: I will not destroy the for .x. sake.

33. And the LORde wet his waye as soone as he had lefte comenynge with Abraha. And Abraham returned vnto his place

## Genesis 19

1. And there came .ij. angells to Sodome at euen. And Lot satt at the gate of the cyte. And Lot sawe the and rose vp agaynst them and he bowed hym selfe to he grounde with his face.

2. And he sayde: Se lordes turne in I praye you in to youre servauntes house and tary all nyghte and wash youre fete and ryse vp early and go on youre wayes. And they sayde: nay but we will byde in the streates all nyghte.

3. And he copelled them excedyngly. And they turned in vnto hym and entred in to his house and he made them a feaste and dyd bake swete cakes and they ate.

4. But before they went to rest the men of the cyte of Sodome compassed the house rownde aboute both olde and yonge all the people from all quarters.

5. And they called vnto Lot and sayde vnto him: where are the men which came in to thy house to nyghte? brynge the out unto vs that we may do oure lust with them.

6. And Lot went out at doores vnto them and shote the dore after him

7. and sayde: nay for goddes sake brethren do not so wekedly.

8. Beholde I haue two doughters which haue knowne no man the will I brynge out vnto you: do with them as it semeth you good: Only vnto these men do nothynge for therfore came they vnder the shadowe of my rofe.

9. And they sayde: come hither. And they sayde: camest thou not in to sogeorne and wilt thou be now a iudge? we will suerly deale worse with the than with themAnd as they preased fore vppon Lot and beganne to breake vp the doore

10. the men put forth their handes and pulled Lot in to the house to them and shott to the doore.

11. And the men that were at the doore of the house they smote with blyndnesse both small and greate: so that they coude not fynde the doore.

12. And the men sayde moreover vnto Lot: Yf thou have yet here any sonne in lawe or sonnes or doughters or what so euer thou hast in the cyte brynge it out of this place:

13. for we must destroy this place because the crye of the is great before the LORde. Wherfore he hath sent vs to destroy it.

14. And Lot went out and spake vnto his sonnes in lawe which shulde haue maried his doughters and sayde: stonde vpp and get yow out of this place for the LORde will destroy the cite. But he semed as though he had mocked vnto his sonnes in law.

15. And as the mornynge arose the angells caused Lot to spede him saynge. Stonde vp take thy wyfe and thy two doughters and that that is at hande lest thou perish in the synne of the cyte.

16. And as he prolonged the tyme the men caught both him his wife ad his two doughters by the handes because the LORde was mercyfull vnto him ad they brought him forth and sette him without the cyte.

17. When they had brought them out they sayde: Saue thy lyfe and loke not behynde the nether tary thou in any place of the contre but saue thy selfe in the mountayne lest thou perisshe.

18. Than sayde Lot vnto them: Oh nay my lorde:

19. beholde in as moch as thy servaunte hath fownde grace in thy syghte now make thi mercy great which thou shewest vnto me in savinge my lyfe. For I can not saue my selfe in the mountayns lest some misfortune fall vpon me and I dye.

20. Beholde here is a cyte by to flee vnto and it is a lytle one: let me saue my selfe therein: is it not a litle one that my soule may lyue?

21. And he sayde to him: se I haue receaved thy request as concernynge this thynge that I will nott overthrowe this cytie for the which thou hast spoken.

22. Haste the ad saue thy selfe there for I can do nothynge tyll thou be come in thyder. And therfore the name of the cyte is called Zoar.

23. And the sone was vppon the erth when Lot was entred in to Zoar.

24. Than the LORde rayned vpon Sodome and Gomorra brymstone and fyre from the LORde out of heaven

25. and overthrewe those cyteis and all the region and all that dwelled in the cytes and that that grewe vpon the erth.

26. And lots wyfe loked behynde her ad was turned in to a pillare of salte.

27. Abraham rose vp early and got him to the place where he stode before the LORde

28. and loked toward Sodome and Gomorra and toward all the londe of that contre. And as he loked: beholde the smoke of the contre arose as it had bene the smoke of a fornace.

29. But yet whe God destroyed the cities of ye regio he thought a pon Abraha: and sent Lot out from the dager of the overthrowenge when he overthrewe the cyttes where Lot dwelled.

30. And Lot departed out of Zoar and dwelled in the mountayns ad his .ij. doughters with him for he feared to tary in Zoar: he dweld therfore in a caue both he and his .ij. doughters also.

31. Than sayde the elder vnto the yonger oure father is olde and there are no moo men in the erth to come in vnto vs after the maner of all the world.

32. Come therfore let vs geue oure father wyne to dryncke and let vs lye with him that we may saue seed of oure father.

33. And they gaue their father wyne to drynke that same nyghte. And the elder doughter went and laye with her father. And he perceaued it not nether when she laye doune nether when she rose vp.

34. And on the morowe the elder sayde vnto the yonger: beholde yesternyghte laye I with my father. Let us geue hym wyne to drinke this nyghte also and goo thou and lye with him and let us saue seed of oure father.

35. And they gaue their father wyne to drincke that nyghte also. And the yonger arose and laye with him. And he perceaved it not: nether when she laye downe nether when she rose vp.

36. Thus were both the doughters of lot with childe by their father

37. And the elder bare a sone and called hym Moab which is the father of the Moabytes vnto this daye.

38. And the yonger bare a sonne and called hym Ben Ammi which is the father of the childern of Ammon vnto this daye.

## Genesis 20

1. And Abraham departed thence towarde the southcontre and dwelled betwene Cades and Sur ad sogeorned in Gerar.

2. And Abraham sayde of Sara his wyfe that she was his sister. Than Abimelech kynge of Gerar sent and fett Sara awaye.

3. And God came to Abimelech by nyghte in a dreame and sayde to him: Se thou art but a deed man for the womas sake which thou hast taken awaye for she is a mans wyfe.

4. But Abimelech had not yet come nye her and therfore sayde: lorde wilt thou sley rightewes people?

5. sayde not he vnto me that she was hys sister? yee and sayde not she herself that he was hir brother? wyth a pure herte and innocent handes haue I done this.

6. And God sayde vnto him in a dreame. I wot it well that thou dydest it in the purenesse of thi herte. And therfore I kepte ye that thou shuldest not synne agenst me nether suffred I the to come nygh her.

7. Now therfore delyuer the ma his wyfe ageyne for he is a prophete. And let him praye for the that thou mayst lyue. But and yf thou delyuer her not agayne be sure that thou shalt dye the deth with all that thou hast.

8. Than Abimelech rose vp be tymes in the mornynge and called all his servauntes and tolde all these thinges in their eares and the men were sore a frayde.

9. And Abimelech called Abraham and sayde vnto him: What hast thou done vnto vs and what haue I offended the that thou shuldest brynge on me and on my kyngdome so greate a synne? thou hast done dedes vnto me that ought not to be done.

10. And Abimelech sayde morouer vnto Abraham: What sawest thou that moved the to do this thinge?

11. And Abraham Answered. I thought that peradveture the feare of God was not in this place and that they shulde sley me for my wyfes sake:

12. yet in very dede she is my sister the doughter of my father but not of my mother: and became my wyfe.

13. And after God caused me to wandre out of my fathers house I sayde vnto her: This kyndnesse shalt thou shewe vnto me in all places where we come that thou saye of me how that I am thy brother.

14. Than toke Abimelech shepe and oxen menservauntes and wemenseruauntes and gaue them vnto Abraham and delyvered him Sara his wyfe agayne.

15. And Abimelech sayde: beholde the lande lyeth be fore the dwell where it pleaseth ye best.

16. And vnto Sara he sayde: Se I haue geuen thy brother a thousande peeces of syluer beholde he shall be a couerynge to thyne eyes vnto all that ar with the and vnto all men and an excuse.

17. And so Abraham prayde vnto God and God healed Abimeleh and his wyfe and hys maydens so that they bare.

18. For the LORde had closed to all the matryces of the house of Abimelech because of Sara Abrahams wyfe.

## Genesis 21

1. The lorde visyted Sara as he had sayde and dyd vnto her acordynge as he had spoken.

2. And Sara was with childe and bare Abraha a sonne in his olde age euen the same season which the LORde had appoynted.

3. And Abraham called his sonnes name that was borne vnto him which Sara bare him Isaac:

4. and Abra circucysed Isaac his sone whe he was .viij. dayes olde as God commaunded him

5. And Abraha was an hundred yere olde when his sonne Isaac was borne vnto him.

6. And Sara sayde: God hath made me a laughinge stocke: for all yt heare will laugh at me

7. She sayde also: who wolde haue sayde vnto Abraham that Sara shulde haue geuen childern sucke or yt I shulde haue borne him a sonne in his olde age:

8. The childe grewe and was wened and Abraham made a great feast the same daye that Isaac was wened.

9. Sara sawe the sonne of Hagar the Egiptian which she had borne vnto Abraham a mockynge.

10. Then she sayde vnto Abraham: put awaye this bondemayde and hyr sonne: for the sonne of this bondwoman shall not be heyre with my sonne Isaac:

11. But the wordes semed verey greavous in Abrahams syghte because of his sonne.

12. Than the LORde sayde vnto Abraham: let it not be greavous vnto the because of the ladd and of thy bondmayde: But in all that Sara hath saide vnto the heare hir voyce for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.

13. Moreouer of the sonne of the Bondwoman will I make a nation because he is thy seed.

14. And Abraham rose vp early in the mornyng and toke brede and a bottell with water and gaue it vnto Hagar puttynge it on hir shulders wyth the lad also and sent her awaye. And she departed and wadred vpp and doune in the wyldernes of Berseba.

15. When the water was spent that was in the botell she cast the lad vnder a bush

16. and went and satt her out of syghte a great waye as it were a bowshote off: For she sayde: I will not se the lad dye. And she satt doune out of syghte and lyfte vp hyr voyce and wepte.

17. And God herde the voyce of the childe. And the angell of God called Hagar out of heaven and sayde vnto her: What ayleth the Hagar? Feare not for God hath herde the voyce of the childe where he lyeth.

18. Aryse and lyfte vp the lad and take hym in thy hande for I will make off him a greate people.

19. And God opened hir eyes and she sawe a well of water. And she went and fylled the bottell with water and gaue the boye drynke.

20. And God was wyth the lad and he grewe and dweld in the wildernesse and became an archer.

21. And he dweld in the wyldernesse of Pharan. And hys mother gott him a wyfe out of the land of Egypte.

22. And it chaunced the same season that Abimelech and Phicoll his chefe captayne spake vnto Abraham saynge: God is wyth the in all that thou doist.

23. Now therfore swere vnto me even here by God that thou wylt not hurt me nor my childern nor my childerns childern. But that thou shalt deale with me and the contre where thou art a straunger acordynge vnto the kyndnesse that I haue shewed the.

24. Then sayde Abraham: I wyll swere.

25. And Abraham rebuked Abimelech for a well of water which Abimelech servauntes had taken awaye.

26. And Abimelech answered I wyst not who dyd it: Also thou toldest me not nether herde I of it but this daye.

27. And Abraham toke shepe and oxen and gaue them vnto Abimelech. And they made both of them a bonde together.

28. And Abraham sett vij. lambes by them selues.

29. And Abimelech sayde vnto Abraham: what meane these .vij. lamdes which thou hast sett by them selues.

30. And he answered: vij. lambes shalt thou take of my hande that it maye be a wytnesse vnto me that I haue dygged this well:

31. Wherfore the place is called Berseba because they sware both of them.

32. Thus made they a bonde to gether at Berseba.Than Abimelech and Phicoll his chefe captayne rose vp and turned agayne vnto the lande of the Philistines.

33. And Abraham planted a wodd in Berseba and called there on the name of the LORde the everlastynge God:

34. and dwelt in the Phelistinlade alonge season

## Genesis 22

1. After these dedes God dyd proue Abraham and sayde vnto him: Abraham. And he answered: here am I.

2. And he sayde: take thy only sonne Isaac whome thou louest and get the vnto the lande of Moria and sacrifyce him there for a sacrifyce vpon one of the mountayns which I will shewe the

3. Than Abraham rose vp early in the mornynge and sadled his asse and toke two of his meyny wyth him and Isaac his sonne: ad clove wod for the sacrifyce and rose vp and gott him to the place which God had appoynted him.

4. The thirde daye Abraham lyfte vp his eyes and sawe the place a farr of

5. and sayde vnto his yong men: byde here with the asse. I and the lad will goo yonder and worshippe and come agayne vnto you.

6. And Abraham toke the wodd of the sacrifyce and layde it vpon Isaac his sonne and toke fyre in his hande and a knyfe. And they went both of them together.

7. Than spake Isaac vnto Abraham his father and sayde: My father? And he answered here am I my sonne. And he sayde: Se here is fyre and wodd but where is the shepe for sacrifyce?

8. And Abraham sayde: my sonne God wyll prouyde him a shepe for sacrifyce. So went they both together.

9. And when they came vnto the place which God shewed him Abraha made an aulter there and dressed the wodd ad bownde Isaac his sonne and layde him on the aulter aboue apon the wodd.

10. And Abraham stretched forth his hande and toke the knyfe to haue kylled his sonne.

11. Than the angell of the LORde called vnto him from heauen saynge: Abraham Abraham. And he answered: here am I.

12. And he sayde: laye not thy handes apon the childe nether do any thinge at all vnto him for now I knowe that thou fearest God in yt thou hast not kepte thine only sonne fro me.

13. And Abraham lyfted vp his eyes and loked aboute: and beholde there was a ram caught by the hornes in a thykette. And he went and toke the ram and offred him vp for a sacrifyce in the steade of his sonne

14. And Abraham called the name of the place the LORde will see: wherfore it is a come saynge this daye: in the mounte will the LORde be sene.

15. And the Angell of the LORde cryed vnto Abraham from heaven the seconde tyme

16. saynge: by my selfe haue I sworne (sayth the LORde) because thou hast done this thinge and hast not spared thy only sonne

17. that I will blesse th and multiplye thy seed as the starres of heaven and as the sonde vpo the seesyde. And thy seed shall possesse the gates of hys enymies.

18. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voyce.

19. So turned Abraham agayne vnto his yonge men and they rose vp and wet to gether to Berseba. And Abraham dwelt at Berseba

20. And it chaused after these thiges that one tolde Abraham saynge: Beholde Milcha she hath also borne childern vnto thy brother Nachor:

21. Hus his eldest sonne and Bus his brother and Lemuell the father of the Sinans

22. and Cesed and Haso and Pildas and Iedlaph and Bethuel.

23. And Bethuel begat Rebecca. These .viij. dyd Milcha bere to Nachor Abrahams brother

4. I am a straunger ad a foryner amonge yow geue me a possession to bury in with you that I may bury my dead oute of my sighte.

5. And the children of heth answered Abraham saynge vnto him:

6. heare vs lorde thou art a prynce of God amonge vs. In the chefest of oure sepulchres bury thy dead: None of vs shall forbydd ye his sepulchre yt thou shuldest not bury thy deade therein.

7. Abraha stode vp and bowed hi selfe before ye people of ye lade ye childre of heth.

8. And he comoned with them saynge: Yf it be youre myndes yt I shall bury my deade oute of my sighte heare me ad speke for me to Ephron the sonne of Zoar:

9. and let him geue me the dubill caue which he hath in the end of his felde for as moch money as it is worth let him geue it me in the presence of you for a possession to bury in.

10. For Hephron dwelled amoge ye childern of heth.Than Ephron the Hethite answered Abraham in the audyece of the childern of Heth and of all that went in at the gates of his cyte saynge:

11. Not so my lorde but heare me: The felde geue I the and the caue that therein is geue I the also And even in the presence of the sonnes of my people geve I it the to bury thy deede in.

12. Than Abraham bowed himselfe before the people of the lade

13. and spake vnto Ephro in the audyence of the people of the contre saynge: I praye the heare me I will geue sylver for the felde take it of me ad so will I bury my deed there.

14. Ephron answered Abraha saynge vnto him

15. My lorde harken vnto me. The lande is worth iiij. hundreth sycles of syluer: But what is that betwixte the and me? bury thy deede.

16. And Abraham harkened vnto Ephron and weyde him the sylver which he had sayde in the audyence of the sonnes of Heth. Euen .iiij. hudred syluer sycles of currant money amonge marchauntes

17. Thus was the felde of Ephron where in the dubbill caue is before Mamre: euen the felde and the caue that is therein and all the trees of the felde which growe in all the borders rounde aboute made sure

18. vnto Abraham for a possession in the syghte of the childern of Heth and of all that went in at the gates of the cyte.

19. And then Abraham buried Sara his wyfe in the double caue of the felde that lyeth before Mare otherwise called Ebron in the lande of Canaan.

20. And so both the felde ad the caue that is therein was made vnto Abraham a sure possession to bury in of the sonnes of Heth.

## Genesis 24

1. Abraham was olde and stryken in dayes and the LORde had blessed him in all thinges.

2. And he sayde vnto his eldest servaunte of his house which had the rule over all that he had: Put thy hande vnder my thye that

3. I maye make the swere by the LORde that is God of heauen and God of the erth that thou shalt not take a wyfe vnto my sonne of the doughters of the canaanytes amonge which I dwell.

4. But shalt goo vnto my contre and to my kynred and there take a wyfe vnto my sonne Isaac.

5. Tha sayde the seruaunte vnto him: what ad yf the woma wyll not agree to come with me vnto this lade shall I brynge thy sonne agayne vnto the lande which thou camest out of:

6. And Abraha sayde vnto him: bewarre of that that thou brige not my sonne thither.

7. The LORde God of heauen which toke me from my fathers house and from the lande where I was borne and which spake vnto me and sware vnto me saynge: vnto thy seed wyll I geue this lande he shall sende his angell before the yt thou mayst take a wife vnto my sonne from thence.

8. Neuerthelesse yf the woma will not agree to come with the than shalt thou be with out daunger of this ooth. But aboue all thinge brynge not my sonne thyther agayne.

9. And the seruaunte put his hand vnder the thye of Abraham and sware to him as concernynge that matter.

10. And the seruaunte toke .x. camels of the camels of his master and departed and had of all maner goodes of his master with him and stode vp and went to Mesopotamia vnto the cytie of Nahor.

11. And made his camels to lye doune with out the cytie by a wels syde of water at euen: aboute the tyme that women come out to drawe water

12. and he sayde.LORde God of my master Abraha sende me good spede this daye and shewe mercy vnto my master Abraham.

13. Lo I stonde here by the well of water and the doughters of the men of this citie will come out to drawe water:

14. Now the damsell to whome I saye stoupe doune thy pytcher and let me drynke. Yf she saye drynke and I will geue thy camels drynke also yt same is she that thou hast ordened for they servaunte Isaac: yee and therby shall I knowe that thou hast shewed mercy on my master.

15. And it came to passe yer he had leeft spakynge that Rebecca came out the doughter of Bethuell sonne to Melcha the wife of Nahor Abrahams brother and hir pytcher apon hir shulder:

16. The damsell was very fayre to loke apon and yet a mayde and vnknowen of man.And she went doune to the well and fylled hyr pytcher and came vp agayne.

17. Then the seruaunte ranne vnto her and sayde: let me syppe a litle water of thi pither.

18. And she sayde: drynke my lorde.And she hasted and late downe her pytcher apon hyr arme and gaue him drinke.

19. And whe she had geven hym drynke she sayde: I will drawe water for thy camels also vntill they haue dronke ynough.

20. And she poured out hyr pitcher in to the trough hastely and ranne agayne vnto the well to fett water: and drewe for all his camels.

21. And the felowe wondred at her. But helde his peace to wete whether the LORde had made his iourney prosperous or not.

22. And as the camels had lefte drynckynge he toke an earynge of halfe a sicle weght and .ij golden bracelettes for hyr hades of .x. sycles weyght of gold

23. and sayde vnto her: whose doughter art thou? tell me: ys there rowme in thy fathers house for vs to lodge in?

24. And she sayde vnto him: I am the doughter of Bethuell the sonne of Milcha which she bare vnto Nahor:

25. and sayde moreouer vnto him: we haue litter and prauonder ynough and also rowme to lodge in.

26. And the man bowed himselfe and worshipped the LORde

27. and sayde: blessed be the LORde God of my master Abraham which ceasseth not to deale mercyfully and truly with my master And hath brought me the waye to my masters brothers house.

19. And Iacob sayde vnto his father: I am Esau thy eldest sonne I haue done acordinge as thou baddest me vp and sytt and eate of my venyson that thi soule maye blesse me.

20. But Isaac sayde vnto his sonne. How cometh it that thou hast fownde it so quicly my sonne? He answered: The LORde thy god brought it to my hande.

21. Than sayde Isaac vnto Iacob: come nere and let me fele the my sonne whether thou be my sonne Esau or not.

22. Than went Iacob to Isaac his father and he felt him and sayde the voyce is Iacobs voyce but the hades ar ye hades of Esau.

23. And he knewe him not because his handes were rough as his brother Esaus handes: And so he blessed him.

24. And he axed him art thou my sonne Esau? And he sayde: that I am.

25. Than sayde he: brynge me and let me eate of my sonnes venyson that my soule maye blesse the. And he broughte him and he ate. And he broughte him wyne also and he dranke.

26. And his father Isaac sayde vnto him: come nere and kysse me my sonne.

28. God geue the of ye dewe of heave and of the fatnesse of the erth and pletie of corne and wyne.

29. People be thy servauntes and natios bowe vnto the. Be lorde ouer thy brethre and thy mothers children stoupe vnto the. Cursed be he yt curseth the and lessed be he that blesseth the.

30. As soone as Isaac had made an end of blessig Iacob and Iacob was scace gone out fro the preasence of Isaac his father: then came Esau his brother fro his huntynge:

31. And had made also meate and brought it in vnto his father and sayde vnto him: Aryse my father and eate of thy sonnes venyson that thy soule maye blesse me.

32. Tha his father Isaac sayde vnto him. Who art thou? he answered I am thy eldest sonne Esau.

33. And Isaac was greatly astoyned out of mesure and sayde: Where is he then that hath huted venyson and broughte it me and I haue eaten of all before thou camest and haue blessed him ad he shall be blessed styll.

34. Whe Esau herde the wordes of his father he cryed out greatly and bitterly aboue mesure and sayde vnto his father: blesse me also my father.

35. And he sayde thy brother came with subtilte ad hath take awaye thy blessynge.

36. Than sayde he: He maye well be called Iacob for he hath vndermyned me now .ij. tymes fyrst he toke awaye my byrthrighte: and se now hath he taken awaye my blessynge also. And he sayde hast thou kepte neuer a blessynge for me?

37. Isaac answered and sayde vnto Esau: beholde I haue made him thi LORde and all his mothers childern haue I made his seruauntes. Moreouer wyth corne ad wyne haue I stablesshed him what ca I do vnto the now my sonne?

38. And Esau sayde vnto his father? hast thou but yt one blessynge my father? blesse me also my father: so lyfted vp Esau his voyce and wepte

39. Tha Isaac his father answered and sayde vnto himBeholde thy dwellynge place shall haue of the fatnesse of the erth and of the dewe of heauen fro aboue.

40. And wyth thy swerde shalt thou lyue and shalt be thy brothers seruaunte But the tyme will come when thou shalt gett the mastrye and lowse his yocke from of thy necke.

41. And Esau hated Iacob because of the blessynge yt his father blessed him with all and sayde in his harte: The dayes of my fathers sorowe are at hade for I will sley my brother Iacob.

42. And these wordes of Esau hir eldest sonne were told to Rebecca. And she sente ad called Iacob hir yongest sonne and sayde vnto hi: beholde thy brother Esau threatneth to kyll the:

43. Now therfore my sone heare my voyce make the redie and flee to Laba my brother at Haran

44. And tarie with him a while vntill thy brothers fearsnes be swaged and

45. vntill thy brothers wrath turne away from the and he forgett that which thou hast done to him. Tha will I sende and fett the awaye from thence. Why shulde I lose you both in one daye.

46. And Rebecca spake to Isaac: I am wery of my life for feare of the doughters of Heth. Yf Iacob take a wife of the doughters of Heth soch one as these are or of the doughters of the lande what lust shulde I haue to lyue.

## Genesis 28

2. but aryse ad gett the to Mesopotamia to the house of Bethuel thy mothers father: and there take the a wife of the doughters of Laban thi mothers brother.

3. And God allmightie blesse the increase the and multiplie the that thou mayst be a nombre of people

4. and geue the the blessynge of Abraham: both to the and to thy seed with the that thou mayst possesse the lade (wherein thou art a strangere) which God gaue vnto Abraham.

5. Thus Isaac sent forth Iacob to goo to Mesopotamia vnto Laban sonne of Bethuel the Sirien and brother to Rebecca Iacobs and Esaus mother.

6. When Esau sawe that Isaac had blessed Iacob and sent him to Mesopotamia to fett him a wife thence and that as he blessed him he gaue him a charge saynge: se thou take not a wife of the doughters of Canaan:

7. and that Iacob had obeyed his father and mother and was gone vnto Mesopotamia:

8. and seynge also that the doughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father:

9. Then went he vnto Ismael and toke vnto the wiues which he had Mahala the doughter of Ismael Abrahams sonne the sister of Nabaioth to be his wife.

10. Iacob departed from Berseba and went toward Haran

11. and came vnto a place and taried there all nyghte because the sonne was downe. And toke a stone of the place and put it vnder his heade and layde him downe in the same place to slepe.

12. And he dreamed: and beholde there stode a ladder apon the erth and the topp of it reached vpp to heaue. And se the angells of God went vp and downe apon it

13. yee ad the LORde stode apon it and sayde.I am the LORde God of Abraham thi father and the God of Isaac: The londe which thou slepest apon will I geue the and thy seed.

14. And thy seed shalbe as the dust of the erth: And thou shalt spreade abrode: west east north and south. And thorow the and thy seed shall all the kynreddes of the erth be blessed.

15. And se I am with the and wylbe thy keper in all places whother thou goost and wyll brynge ye agayne in to this lande: Nether will I leaue the vntill I haue made good all that I haue promysed the.

16. When Iacob was awaked out of his slepe he sayde: surely the LORde is in this place ad I was not aware.

17. And he was afrayde and sayde how fearfull is this place? it is none other but euen the house of God and the gate of heaue.

18. And Iacob stode vp early in the mornynge and toke the stone that he had layde vnder his heade and pitched it vp an ende and poured oyle on the topp of it.

19. And he called the name of the place Bethell for in dede the name of the citie was called Lus before tyme.

20. And Iacob vowed a vowe saynge: Yf God will be with me and wyll kepe me in this iourney which I goo and will geue me bread to eate and cloothes to put on

21. so that I come agayne vnto my fathers house in saftie: then shall the LORde be my God

22. and this stone which I haue sett vp an ende shalbe godes house And of all that thou shalt geue me will I geue the tenth vnto the.

## Genesis 29

1. Then Iacob lyfte vp his fete and wet toward the east countre.

2. And as he loked aboute behold there was a well in the feld and .iij. flockes of shepe laye therby (for at that well were the flockes watered) and there laye a great stone at the well mouth

3. And the maner was to brynge the flockes thyther and to roull the stone fro the welles mouth and to water the shepe and to put the stone agayne vppon the wells mouth vnto his place.

4. And Iacob sayde vnto the: brethern whece be ye? and they sayde: of Haran ar we.

5. And he sayde vnto the: knowe ye Laban the sonne of Nahor. And they sayde: we knowe him.

6. And he sayde vnto the: is he in good health? And they sayde: he is in good health: and boholde his doughter Rahel cometh with ye shepe.

7. And he sayde: lo it is yet a great whyle to nyghte nether is it tyme yt the catell shulde be gathered together: water the shepe and goo and fede the.

8. And they sayde: we maye not vntill all ye flockes be brought together and the stone be roulled fro the wells mouth and so we water oure shepe.

9. Whyle he yet talked with the Rahel came with hir fathers shepe for she kepte them.

10. As soone As Iacob sawe Rahel the doughter of Laban his mothers brother and the shepe of Laban his mothers brother he went and rowled the stone fro the wells mouth and watered the shepe of Laba his mothers brother

11. And Iacob kyssed Rahel and lyfte vp his voyce and wepte:

12. and tolde her also yt he was hir fathers brother and Rebeccas sonne. The Rahel ranne and tolde hir father.

13. When Laban herd tell of Iacob his sisters sonne he ranne agaynst him and embraced hi and kyssed him ad broughte him in to his house. And the Iacob told Laba all ye matter

14. And the Laba sayde: well thou art my bone and my flesh. Abyde with me the space of a moneth.

15. And afterward Laban sayd vnto Iacob: though thou be my brother shuldest thou therfore serue me for nought?tell me what shall thi wages be?

16. And Laban had .ij. doughters the eldest called Lea and the yongest Rahel.

17. Lea was tender eyed: But Rahel was bewtifull ad well fauored.

18. And Iacob loued her well and sayde: I will serue the .vij. yere for Rahel thy yongest doughter.

19. And Laban answered: it is better yt I geue her the than to another man? byde therfore with me.

20. And Iacob serued .vij. yeres for Rahel and they semed vnto him but a fewe dayes for the loue he had to her.

21. And Iacob sayde vnto Laban geue me my wife that I maye lye with hir for the tyme appoynted me is come.

22. Than Laban bade all the men of that place and made a feast.

23. And when eue was come he toke Lea his doughter and broughte her to him and he went in vnto her.

24. And Laban gaue vnto his doughter Lea Zilpha his mayde to be hir seruaunte.

25. And when the mornynge was come beholde it was Lea. Than sayde he to Laban: wherfore hast thou played thus with me? dyd not I serue the for Rahel wherfore than hast thou begyled me?

26. Laban answered: it is not the maner of this place to marke the yongest before the eldest.

27. Passe out this weke and tha shall this also be geuen the for ye seruyce which thou shalt serue me yet .vij. yeres more.

28. And Iacob dyd eue so and passed out that weke and than he gaue hi Rahel his doughter to wyfe also.

29. And Laban gaue to Rahel his doughter Bilha his handmayde to be hir servaute.

30. So laye he by Rahel also and loued Rahel more than Lea and serued him yet .vij. yeres more.

31. When the LORde sawe that Lea was despised he made her frutefull: but Rahel was baren.

32. And Lea conceaued and bare a sonne ad called his name Rube for she sayde::the LORde hath loked apon my tribulation. And now my husbonde will loue me.

33. And she conceaued agayne and bare a sonne and sayde: the LORde hath herde that I am despised ad hath therfore geuen me this sonne also and she called him Simeon.

34. And she conceaued yet and bare a sonne ad sayde: now this once will my husbonde kepe me company because I haue borne him .iij. sonnes: and therfore she called his name Levi.

35. And she conceaued yet agayne and bare a sonne saynge? Now will I prayse the LORde: therfore she called his name Iuda and left bearynge.

## Genesis 30

1. When Rahel sawe that she bare Iacob no childern she enuied hir sister and sayde vnto Iacob: geue me childern or ells I am but deed.

2. Than was Iacob wrooth with Rahel saynge: Am I in godes steade which kepeth fro the the frute of thi wobe?

3. The she sayde: here is my mayde Bilha: go in vnto her that she maye beare vpo my lappe that I maye be encreased by her.

6. Than sayde Rahel. God hath geuen sentece on my syde and hath also herde my voyce and hath geuen me a sonne. Therfore called she him Dan.

7. And Bilha Rahels mayde coceaued agayne and bare Iacob a nother sonne.

8. And Rahel sayde. God is turned and I haue made achaunge with my sister and haue gote ye vpper hade. And she called his name Nepthali

9. Whe Lea sawe that she had left bearinge she toke Silpha hir mayde and gaue her Iacob to wiffe.

10. And Silpha Leas made bare Iacob a sonne.

11. Than sayde Lea: good lucke: and called his name Gad.

12. And Silpha Leas mayde bare Iacob another sonne.

13. Tha sayd Lea: happy am I for the doughters will call me blessed. And called his name Asser.

14. And Rube wet out in the wheat haruest and foude mandragoras in the feldes and brought the vnto his mother Lea. Than sayde Rahel to Lea geue me of thy sonnes madragoras.

15. And Lea answered: is it not ynough yt thou hast take awaye my housbode but woldest take awaye my sonnes mandragoras also? Than sayde Rahel well let him slepe with the this nyghte for thy sonnes mandragoras.

16. And whe Iacob came from the feldes at euen Lea went out to mete him and sayde: come into me for I haue bought the with my sonnes mandragoras.And he slepte with her that nyghte.

17. And God herde Lea yt she coceaued and bare vnto Iacob yt .v. sonne.

18. Than sayde Lea. God hath geue me my rewarde because I gaue my mayde to my housbod and she called him Isachar.

19. And Lea coceaued yet agayne and bare Iacob the sexte sonne.

20. Than sayde she: God hath endewed me with a good dowry. Now will my housbond dwell with me because I haue borne him .vi. sonnes: and called his name Zabulo.

21. After that she bare a doughter and called her Dina.

22. And God remebred Rahel herde her and made her frutefull:

23. so that she coceaued and bare a sonne and sayde God hath take awaye my rebuke.

24. And she called his name Ioseph saynge The lorde geue me yet a nother sonne.

25. As soone as Rahel had borne Ioseph Iacob sayde to Laban: Sede me awaye yt I maye goo vnto myne awne place and cutre

26. geue me my wives and my childern for whome I haue serued the and let me goo; for thou knowest what seruyce I haue done the.

27. Than sayde Laban vnto hi: If I haue fownde fauoure in thy syghte (for I suppose yt the LORde hath blessed me for thy sake)

28. appoynte what thy rewarde shalbe and I will geue it ye.

29. But he sayde vnto hym thou knowest what seruyce I haue done ye and in what takynge thy catell haue bene vnder me:

30. for it was but litle that thou haddest before I came and now it is encreased in to a multitude and the LORDE hath blessed the for my sake.But now when shall I make provysion for myne awne house also?

31. And he sayde: what shall I geue the? And Iacob answerd: thou shalt geue me nothinge at all yf thou wilt do this one thinge for me: And then will I turne agayne and fede thy shepe and kepe them.

32. I will go aboute all thy shepe this daye and separate fro the all the shepe that are spotted and of dyverse coloures and all blacke shepe amonge the lambes and the partie and spotted amonge the kyddes: And then such shalbe my rewarde.

33. So shall my rightwesnes answere for me: when the tyme commeth that I shall receaue my rewarde of the: So that what soeuer is not speckeld and partie amonge the gootes and blacke amonge the lambes let that be theft with me.

34. Than sayde Laban: loo I am contete that it be acordinge as thou hast sayde.

35. And he toke out that same daye the he gootes that were partie and of dyuerse coloures and all the she gootes that were spotted and partie coloured and all that had whyte in the and all the blacke amonge the lambes: ad put the in the kepinge of his sonnes

36. and sett thre dayes ourney ibetwixte hiselfe and Iacob. And so Iacob kepte ye rest of Labas shepe.

37. Iacob toke roddes of grene popular hasell and of chestnottrees and pilled whyte strakes in the and made the white apere in the staues:

38. And he put the staues which he had pilled eue before ye shepe in the gutters and watrynge troughes whe the shepe came to drynke: yt they shulde coceaue whe they came to drynke.

39. And the shepe coceaued before the staues and brought forth straked spotted and partie.

40. The Iacob parted the labes and turned the faces of the shepe toward spotted thinges and toward all maner of blacke thinges thorow out the flockes of Laba. And he made him flockes of his owne by the selfe which he put not vnto the flockes of Laba.

41. And allwaye in the first buckinge tyme of the shepe Iacob put the staues before the shepe in the gutters yt they myghte conceaue before the staues

42. But in the latter buckynge tyme he put them not there: so the last brode was Labas and the first Iacobs.

43. And the man became excedynge ryche and had many shepe maydeseruauntes menseruauntes camels and asses.

## Genesis 31

1. And Iacob herde the wordes of Labas sonnes how they sayde: Iacob hath take awaye all that was oure fathers and of oure fathers goodes hath he gote all this honoure.

2. And Iacob behelde the countenauce of Laban that it was not toward him as it was in tymes past.

3. And the LORde sayde vnto Iacob: turne agayne in to the lade of thy fathers and to thy kynred and I wilbe with ye.

4. Tha Iacob sent and called Rahel and Lea to the felde vnto his shepe

5. and sayde vnto the: I se youre fathers countenauce yt it is not toward me as in tymes past. Morouer ye God of my father hath bene with me.

6. And ye knowe how that I haue serued youre father with all my myghte.

7. And youre father hath disceaued me and chaunged my wages .x. tymes: But God suffred him not to hurte me.

8. When he sayde the spotted shalbe thy wages tha all the shepe barespotted. Yf he sayde the straked shalbe thi rewarde tha bare all the shepe straked:

9. thus hath God take awaye youre fathers catell and geue the me.

10. For in buckynge tyme I lifted vp myne eyes and sawe in a dreame: and beholde the rammes that bucked the shepe were straked spotted and partie.

11. And the angell of God spake vnto me in a dreame saynge: Iacob. And I answered: here am I.

12. And he sayde: lyfte vp thyne eyes ad see how all therames that leape vpon the shepe are straked spotted and partie: for I haue sene all that Laban doth vnto ye.

13. I am ye god of Bethell where thou anoynteddest the stone ad where thou vowdest a vowe vnto me. Now aryse and gett the out of this countre ad returne vnto the lade where thou wast borne.

14. Than answered Rahel and Lea and sayde vnto him: we haue no parte nor enheritaunce in oure fathers house

15. he cownteth us eue as straungers for he hath solde vs and hath euen eaten vp the price of vs.

16. Moreouer all the riches which God hath take from oure father that is oures and oure childerns. Now therfore what soeuer God hath sayde vnto the that doo.

17. Tha Iacob rose vp and sett his sones and wiues vp vpon camels

18. and caried away all his catell and all his substace which he had gotte in Mesopotamia for to goo to Isaac his father vnto the lade of Canaan.

19. Laba was gone to shere his shepe and Rahel had stolle hir fathers ymages.

20. And Iacob went awaye vnknowynge to Laban the Sirie and tolde him not yt he fled.

21. So fled he and all yt he had and made him self redy and passed ouer the ryuers and sett his face streyght towarde the mounte Gilead.

22. Apo the thirde day after was it tolde Laba yt Iacob was fled.

23. Tha he toke his brethre with him and folowed after him .vij. dayes iourney and ouer toke him at the mounte Gilead.

24. And God came to Laba the Siria in a dreame by nyghte and sayde vnto him: take hede to thi selfe that thou speake not to Iacob oughte save good.

25. And Laba ouer toke Iacob: and Iacob had pitched his tete in yt mounte. And Laban with his brethern pitched their tete also apon the mounte Gilead.

26. Than sayde Laba to Iacob: why hast thou this done vnknowynge to me and hast caried awaye my doughters as though they had bene take captyue with swerde?

27. Wherfore wentest thou awaye secretly vnknowne to me and didest not tell me yt I myghte haue broughte yt on the waye with myrth syngynge tymrells and harppes

28. and hast not suffred me to kysse my childern and my doughters. Thou wast a fole to do

29. it for I am able to do you evell. But the God of youre father spake vnto me yesterdaye saynge take hede tha thou speake not to Iacob oughte saue goode.

30. And now though thou wetest thi waye because thou logest after thi fathers house yet wherfore hast thou stollen my goddes?

31. Iacob answered and sayde to Laba: because I was afrayed and thought that thou woldest haue take awaye thy doughters fro me.

32. But with whome soeuer thou fyndest thy goddes let him dye here before oure brethre. Seke that thine is by me and take it to the: for Iacob wist not that Rahel had stolle the.

33. Tha wet Laba in to Iacobs tete and in to Leas tete and in to .ij. maydens tentes: but fownde the not. Tha wet he out of Leas tete and entred in to Rahels tete.

34. And Rahel toke the ymages and put them in the camels strawe and sate doune apo the. And Laba serched all the tete: but fownde the not.

35. Tha sayde she to hir father: my lorde be not angrye yt I ca not ryse vp before the for the disease of weme is come apon me. So searched he but foude the not.

36. Iacob was wrooth and chode with Laba: Iacob also answered and sayde to him: what haue I trespaced or what haue I offended that thou foloweddest after me?

37. Thou hast searched all my stuffe and what hast thou founde of all thy housholde stuffe? put it here before thi brethern and myne and let the iudge betwyxte vs both.

38. This xx. yere yt I haue bene wyth the thy shepe and thy gootes haue not bene baren and the rammes of thi flocke haue I not eate.

39. What soeuer was torne of beastes I broughte it not vnto ye but made it good mysilf: of my hade dydest thou requyre it whether it was stollen by daye or nyghte

40. Moreouer by daye the hete consumed me and the colde by nyghte and my slepe departed fro myne eyes.

41. Thus haue I bene .xx. yere in thi house and serued the .xiiij. yeres forthy .ij. doughters and vi. yere for thi shepe and thou hast changed my rewarde .x. tymes.

42. And excepte the God of my father the God of Abraha and the God whome Isaac feareth had bene with me: surely thou haddest sent me awaye now all emptie. But God behelde my tribulation and the laboure of my handes: and rebuked the yester daye.

43. Laban answered ad sayde vnto Iacob: the doughters are my doughters and the childern ar my childern and the shepe are my shepe ad all that thou seist is myne. And what can I do this daye vnto these my doughters or vnto their childern which they haue borne?

44. Now therfore come on let us make a bonde I and thou together and let it be a wytnesse betwene the and me.

45. Than toke Iacob a stone and sett it vp an ende

46. ad sayde vnto his brethern gather stoones And they toke stoones ad made an heape and they ate there vpo the heape.

47. And Laba called it Iegar Sahadutha but Iacob called it Gylead.

48. Than sayde Laban: this heape be witnesse betwene the and me this daye (therfore is it called Gilead)

49. and this totehill which the lorde seeth (sayde he) be wytnesse betwene me and the when we are departed one from a nother:

50. that thou shalt not vexe my doughters nether shalt take other wyves vnto them. Here is no man with vs: beholde God is wytnesse betwixte the and me.

51. And Laban sayde moreouer to Iacob: beholde this heape and this marke which I haue sett here betwyxte me and the:

52. this heape be wytnesse and also this marcke that I will not come ouer this heape to the ad thou shalt not come ouer this heape ad this marke to do any harme.

53. The God of Abraham the God of Nahor and the God of theyr fathers be iudge betwixte vs.And Iacob sware by him that his father Isaac feared.

54. Then Iacob dyd sacrifyce vpon the mounte and called his brethern to eate breed. And they ate breed and taried all nyghte in the hyll.

55. And early in the mornynge Laban rose vp and kyssed his childern and his doughters and blessed the and departed and wet vnto his place agayne.

## Genesis 32

1. But Iacob went forth on his iourney. And the angells of God came and mett him.

2. And when Iacob sawe them he sayde: this is godes hoost: and called the name of that same place Mahanaim.

3. Iacob sente meessengers before him to Esau his brother vnto the lande of Seir and the felde of Edom.

4. And he comaunded them saynge: se that ye speake after this maner to my lorde Esau: thy seruaunte Iacob sayth thus. I haue sogerned ad bene a straunger with Laban vnto this tyme:

5. and haue gotten oxen asses and shepe menservauntes and wemanseruauntes and haue sent to shewe it mi lorde that I may fynde grace in thy syghte.

6. And the messengers came agayne to Iacob sainge: we came vnto thi brother Esau and he cometh ageynst the and .iiij. hundred men with hi.

7. Than was Iacob greatlye afrayde and wist not which waye to turne him selfe and devyded the people that was with him and the shepe oxen and camels in to .ij. companies

8. and sayde: Yf Esau come to the one parte and smyte it the other may saue it selfe.

9. And Iacob sayde: O god of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac: LORde which saydest vnto me returne vnto thy cuntre and to thy kynrede and I will deall wel with the.

10. I am not worthy of the leaste of all the mercyes and treuth which thou hast shewed vnto thy seruaunte. For with my staf came I over this Iordane and now haue Igoten .ij. droves

11. Delyver me from the handes of my brother Esau for I feare him: lest he will come and smyte the mother with the childeru.

12. Thou saydest that thou woldest surely do me good and woldest make mi seed as the sonde of the see which can not be nombred for multitude.

13. And he taried there that same nyghte and toke of that which came to hande a preasent vnto Esau his brother:

14. ij hundred she gootes ad xx he gootes: ij hundred shepe and xx rammes:

15. thyrtye mylch camels with their coltes: xl kyne ad x bulles: xx she asses ad foles

16. and delyuered them vnto his seruauntes euery drooue by them selues ad sayde vnto them: goo forth before me and put a space betwyxte euery drooue.

17. And he comaunded the formest sayngeWhe Esau my brother meteth the ad axeth the saynge: whose seruaute art thou and whither goost thou and whose ar these that goo before ye:

18. thou shalt say they be thy seruaunte Iacobs and are a present sent vnto my lorde Esau and beholde he him selfe cometh after vs.

19. And so comaunded he the seconde ad euen so the thirde and lykewyse all that folowed the drooues sainge of this maner se that ye speake vnto Esau whe ye mete him

20. ad saye more ouer. Beholde thy seruaunte Iacob cometh after vs for he sayde. I will pease his wrath with the present yt goth before me and afterward I will see him myself so peradventure he will receaue me to grace.

21. So went the preset before him ad he taried all that nyghte in the tente

22. ad rose vp the same nyghte ad toke his .ij. wyves and his .ij. maydens and his .xi. sonnes and went ouer the foorde Iabok.

23. And he toke them ad sent the ouer the ryuer ad sent ouer that he had

24. ad taried behinde him selfe alone.And there wrastled a man with him vnto the breakynge of the daye.

25. And when he sawe that he coude not prevayle agaynst him he smote hi vnder the thye and the senowe of Iacobs thy shranke as he wrastled with him.

26. And he sayde: let me goo for the daye breaketh. And he sayde: I will not lett the goo excepte thou blesse me.

27. And he sayde vnto him: what is thy name? He answered: Iacob.

28. And he sayde: thou shalt be called Iacob nomore but Israell. For thou hast wrastled with God and with men ad hast preuayled.

29. And Iacob asked him sainge tell me thi name. And he sayde wherfore dost thou aske after my name? and he blessed him there.

30. And Iacob called the name of the place Peniel for I haue sene God face to face and yet is my lyfe reserved.

31. And as he went ouer Peniel the sonne rose vpon him and he halted vpon his thye:

32. wherfore the childern of Israell eate not of the senow that shrancke vnder the thye vnto this daye: because that he smote Iacob vnder the thye in the senow that shroncke.

## Genesis 33

1. Iacob lyfte vp his eyes and sawe hys brother Esau come and with him .iiij. hundred men. And he deuyded the childern vnto Lea and vnto Rahel and vnto ye ij. maydens.

2. And he put the maydens ad their childern formest ad Lea and hir childern after and Rahel ad Ioseph hindermost.

3. And he went before them and fell on the grownde, vij. tymes vntill he came vnto his brother.

4. Esau ranne agaynst him and enbraced hym and fell on his necke and kyssed him and they wepte.

5. And he lifte vp his eyes and sawe the wyves and their childern and sayde: what are these which thou there hast? And he sayde: they are the childern which God hath geuen thy seruaunte.

6. Than came the maydens forth ad dyd their obaysaunce.

7. Lea also and hir childern came and dyd their obaysaunce. And last of all came Ioseph and Rahel and dyd their obaysaunce.

8. And he sayde: what meanyst thou with all ye drooues which I mett. And he answered: to fynde grace in the syghte of my lorde.

9. And Esau sayde: I haue ynough my brother kepe that thou hast vnto thy silf.

10. Iacob answered: oh nay but yf I haue founde grace in thy syghte receaue my preaset of my hade: for I haue sene thy face as though I had sene ye face of God: wherfore receaue me to grace

11. and take my blessynge that I haue brought the for God hath geuen it me frely. And I haue ynough of all thynges. And so he compelled him to take it.

12. And he sayde: let us take oure iourney and goo and I will goo in thy copany.

13. And he sayde vnto him: my lorde knoweth that I haue tendre childern ewes and kyne with yonge vnder myne hande which yf men shulde ouerdryue but euen one daye the hole flocke wolde dye.

14. Let my lorde therfore goo before his servaunte and I will dryue fayre and softly accordynge as the catell that goth before me and the childern be able to endure: vntill I come to mi lorde vnto Seir.

15. And Esau sayde: let me yet leaue some of my folke with the. And he sayde: what neadeth it? let me fynde grace in the syghte of my lorde

16. So Esau went his waye agayne yt same daye vnto Seir.

17. And Iacob toke his iourney toward Sucoth and bylt him an house and made boothes for his catell: wherof the name of the place is called Sucoth.

18. And Iacob went to Salem to ye cytie of Sichem in the lande of Canaa after that he was come from Mesopotamia and pitched before the cyte

19. and bought a parcell of ground where he pitched his tent of the childern of Hemor Sichems father for an hundred lambes.

20. And he made there an aulter and there called vpon the myghtie God of Israell.

## Genesis 34

1. Dina the doughter of Lea which she bare vnto Iacob went out to see the doughters of the lande.

2. And Siche the sonne of Hemor the Heuite lorde of the countre sawe her and toke her and laye with her and forced her:

3. and his harte laye vnto Dina ye doughter of Iacob. And he loued yt damsell and spake kidly vnto her

4. and spake vnto his father Hemor saynge gett me this mayde vnto my wyfe.

5. And Iacob herde that he had defyled Dina his doughter but his sonnes were with the catell in the felde and therfore he helde his peace vntill they were come.

6. Then Hemor the father of Sichem went out vnto Iacob to come with him.

7. And the sonnes of Iacob came out of the felde as soone as they herde it for it greued them and they were not a litle wrooth because he had wrought folie in Israell in that he had lyen with Iacobs doughter which thinge oughte not to be done.

8. And Hemor comened with the sainge? the soule of my sonne Siche logeth for youre doughter geue her him to wyfe

9. and make mariages with vs: geue youre doughters vnto vs ad take oure doughters vnto you

10. and dwell with vs and the lande shall be at youre pleasure dwell and do youre busynes and haue youre possessions there in.

11. And Sichem sayde vnto hyr father and hir brethern: let me fynde grace in youre eyes and what soeuer ye apoynte me that will I geue.

12. Axe frely of me both the dowry and gyftes and I will geue acordynge as ye saye vnto me and geue me the damsell to wyfe.

13. Then the sonnes of Iacob answered to Sichem ad Hemor his father deceytefully because he had defyled Dina their syster.

14. And they sayde vnto them we can not do this thinge yt we shulde geue oure syster to one that is vncircumcysed for that were a shame vnto us.

15. Only in this will we consent vnto you? Yf ye will be as we be that all the men childern amonge you be circumcysed

16. tha will we geue oure doughter to you and take youres to vs and will dwell with you and be one people.

17. But and yf ye will not harken vnto vs to be circumcysed than will we take oure doughter and goo oure wayes.

18. And their wordes pleased Hemor and Sichem his sonne.

19. And the yonge man deferde not for to do the thinge because he had a lust to Iacobs doughter: he was also most sett by of all that were in his fathers house.

20. Tha Hemor and Sichem went vnto the gate of their cyte and comened with the men of their cyte sayncte.

21. These men ar peasable with us and will dwell in the lade and do their occupatio therin And in the land is rowme ynough for the let us take their doughters to wyues and geue them oures:

22. only herin will they consent vnto vs for to dwell with vs and to be one people: yf all the men childern that are amonge vs be circumcysed as they are.

23. Their goodes and their substance and all their catell are oures only let vs consente vnto them that they maye dwell with vs.

24. And vnto Hemor and Sichem his sonneharkened all that went out at the gate of his cyte. And all the men childern were circumcysed what soeuer went out at the gates of his cyte.

25. And the third daye when it was paynefull to them ij. of the sonnes of Iacob Simeon and Leui Dinas brethren toke ether of them his swerde and went in to the cyte boldly and slewe all yt was male

26. and slewe also Hemor and Sichem his sonne with the edge of the swerde ad toke Dina their sister out of Sichems house and went their waye.

27. Than came the sonnes of Iacob vpon the deede and spoyled the cyte because they had defyled their sister:

28. and toke their shepe oxen asses and what so euer was in the cyte and also in ye feldes

29. And all their goodes all their childern and their wyues toke they captyue and made havock of all that was in the houses.

30. And Iacob sayde to Simeon and Leui: ye haue troubled me ad made me styncke vnto the inhabitatours of the lande both to the Canaanytes and also vnto the Pherezites. And I am fewe in nombre. Wherfore they shall gather them selves together agaynst me and sley me and so shall I and my house be dystroyed.

31. And they answered: shuld they deall with oure sister as wyth an whoore?

## Genesis 35

1. And God sayd vnto Iacob aryse ad get the vp to Bethell and dwell there. And make there an aulter vnto God that apeared vnto the when thou fleddest from Esau thy brother.

2. Than sayd Iacob vnto his housholde and to all yt were with him put away the strauge goddes that are amonge you and make youre selues cleane and chaunge youre garmetes

3. and let vs aryse and goo vp to Bethell yt I maye make an aulter there vnto God which herde me in the daye of my tribulatio and was wyth me in the waye which I went.

4. And they gaue vnto Iacob all the straunge goddes which were vnder their handes ad all their earynges which were in their eares and Iacob hyd them vnder an ooke at Sichem.

5. And they departed. And the feare of God fell vpon the cyties that were rounde aboute them that they durst not folowe after the sonnes of Iacob.

6. So came Iacob to Lus in the lande of Canaan otherwise called Bethell with all the people that was with him.

7. And he buylded there an aulter and called the place Elbethell: because that God appered vnto him there when he fled from his brother.

8. Than dyed Deborr Rebeccas norse and was buryed benethe Bethell vnder an ooke. And the name of it was called the ooke of lamentation.

9. And God appeared vnto Iacob agayne after he came out of Mesopotamia and blessed him

10. and sayde vnto him: thy name is Iacob. Notwithstondynge thou shalt be nomore called Iacob but Israel shalbe thy name. And so was his name called Israell.

11. And God sayde vnto him: I am God allmightie growe and multiplye: for people and a multitude of people shall sprynge of the yee ad kynges shall come out of they loynes.

12. And the lande which I gaue Abraha and Isaac will I geue vnto the and vnto thi seed after the will I geue it also.

13. And god departed fro him in the place where he talked with him.

14. And Iacob set vp a marke in the place where he talked with him: euen a pilloure of stone and powred drynkeoffringe theron and powred also oyle theron

15. and called the name of the place where God spake with him Bethell.

3. And Israel loued Ioseph more than all his childern because he begat hym in his olde age and he made him a coote of many coloures.

4. When his brothren sawe that their father loued him more than all his brethern they hated him and coude not speke one kynde worde vnto him.

5. Moreouer Ioseph dreamed a dreawe and tolde it his brethren: wherfore they hated him yet the more.

6. And he sayde vnto them heare I praye yow this dreame which I haue dreamed:

7. Beholde we were makynge sheues in the felde: and loo my shefe arose and stode vpright and youres stode rounde aboute and made obeysaunce to my shefe.

8. Than sayde his brethren vnto him: what shalt thou be oure kynge or shalt thou reigne ouer us? And they hated hi yet the more because of his dreame and of his wordes.

10. And the thinge which he dyd displeased the LORde wherfore he slew him also.

11. Than sayde Iudas to Thamar his doughter in lawe: remayne a wydow at thi fathers house tyll Sela my sonne be growne: for he feared lest he shulde haue dyed also as his brethren did. Thus went Thamar and dwelt in hir fathers house.

19. And she gatt her vp and went and put her mantell from her ad put on hir widowes rayment agayne.

20. And Iudas sent the kydd by his neybure of Odollam for to fetch out his pledge agayne from the wifes hande. But he fownde her not.

21. Than asked he the men of the same place saynge: where is the whoore that satt at Enaim in the waye? And they sayde: there was no whoore here.

22. And he came to Iuda agayne saynge: I can not fynde her and also the men of the place sayde: that there was no whoore there.

23. And Iuda sayde: let her take it to her lest we be shamed: for I sente the kydd and thou coudest not fynde her.

24. And it came to passe that after .iij. monethes one tolde Iuda saynge: Thamar thy doughter in lawe hath played the whoore and with playnge the whoore is become great with childe. And Iuda sayde: brynge her forth ad let her be brente.

## Genesis 39

1. Ioseph was brought vnto Egipte ad Putiphar a lorde of Pharaos: ad his chefe marshall an Egiptian bought him of ye Ismaelites which brought hi thither

2. And the LORde was with Ioseph and he was a luckie felowe and continued in the house of his master the Egiptian.

3. And his master sawe that the ORde was with him and that the LORde made all that he dyd prosper in his hande:

4. Wherfore he founde grace in his masters syghte and serued him. And his master made him ruelar of his house and put all that he had in his hande.

5. And as soone as he had made him ruelar ouer his house ad ouer all that he had the LORde blessed this Egiptians house for Iosephs sake and the blessynge of the LORde was vpon all that he had: both in the house and also in the feldes.

6. And therfore he left all that he had in Iosephs hande and loked vpon nothinge that was with him saue only on the bread which he ate. And Ioseph was a goodly persone and a well favored

7. And it fortuned after this that his masters wife cast hir eyes vpon Ioseph and sayde come lye with me.

8. But he denyed and sayde to her: Beholde my master woteth not what he hath in the house with me but hath commytted all that he hath to my hande

9. He him selfe is not greatter in the house than I ad hath kepte nothige fro me but only the because thou art his wife. How than cam I do this great wykydnes for to synne agaynst God?

10. And after this maner spake she to Ioseph daye by daye: but he harkened not vnto her to slepe nere her or to be in her company.

11. And it fortuned aboute the same season that Ioseph entred in to the house to do his busynes: and there was none of the houshold by in the house.

12. And she caught him by the garment saynge: come slepe with me. And he left his garment in hir hande ad fled and gott him out

13. when she sawe that he had left his garmet in hir hande and was fled out

14. she called vnto the men of the house and tolde them saynge: Se he hath brought in an Hebrewe vnto vs to do vs shame. for he came in to me for to haue slept myth me. But I cried with a lowde voyce.

15. And when he harde that I lyfte vp my voyce and cryed he left his garment with me and fled awaye and got him out.

16. And she layed vp his garment by her vntill hir lorde came home.

17. And she told him acordynge to these wordes saynge. This Hebrues servaunte which thou hast brought vnto vs came in to me to do me shame.

18. But as soone as I lyft vp my voyce and cryed he left his garment with me and fled out.

19. When his master herde the woordes of his wyfe which she tolde him saynge: after this maner dyd thy servaunte to me he waxed wrooth.

20. And he toke Ioseph and put him in pryson: euen in the place where the kinges prisoners laye bounde. And there contynued he in preson.

21. But the LORde was with Ioseph ad shewed him mercie and gott him fauoure in the syghte of the keper of ye preson

22. which commytted to Iosephe hade all the presoners that were in the preson housse. And what soeuer was done there yt dyd he.

## Genesis 40

1. And it chaunced after this that the chefe butlar of the kynge of Egipte and his chefe baker had offended there lorde the kynge of Egypte.

2. And Pharao was angrie with them and put the in warde in his chefe marshals house:

3. euen in ye preson where Ioseph was bownd.

4. And the chefe marshall gaue Ioseph a charge with them and he serued them. And they contynued a season in warde.

5. And they dreamed ether of them in one nyghte: both the butlar and the baker of the kynge of Egipte which were bownde in the preson house ether of them his dreame and eche manes dreame of a sondrie interpretation

6. When Ioseph came in vnto them in the mornynge and loked apon them: beholde they were sadd.

7. And he asked them saynge wherfore loke ye so sadly to daye?

8. They answered him we haue dreamed a dreame and haue no man to declare it. And Ioseph sayde vnto the. Interpretynge belongeth to God but tel me yet.

9. And the chefe butlar tolde his dreame to Ioseph and sayde vnto him. In my dreame me thought there stode a vyne before me

10. and in the vyne were .iij. braunches and it was as though it budded and her blossos shottforth: and ye grapes there of waxed rype.

11. And I had Pharaos cuppe in my hande and toke of the grapes and wronge them in to Pharaos cuppe and delyvered Pharaos cuppe into his hande.

12. And Ioseph sayde vnto him this is the interpretation of it.

13. The .iij. braunches ar thre dayes: for within thre dayes shall Pharao lyft vp thine heade and restore the vnto thyne office agayne and thou shalt delyuer Pharaos cuppe in to his hade after the old maner even as thou dydest when thou wast his butlar.

14. But thinke on me with the when thou art in good case and shewe mercie vnto me. And make mencion of me to Pharao and helpe to brynge me out of this house:

15. for I was stollen out of the lande of the Hebrues and here also haue I done nothige at all wherfore they shulde haue put me in to this dongeon.

16. When the chefe baker sawe that he had well interpretate it he sayde vnto Ioseph me thought also in my dreame yt I had. iij. wyker baskettes on my heade?

17. And in ye vppermost basket of all maner bakemeates for Pharao. And the byrdes ate them out of the basket apon my heade

18. Ioseph answered and sayde: this is the interpretation therof. The .iij. baskettes are .iij. dayes

19. for this daye .iij. dayes shall Pharao take thy heade from the and shall hange the on a tree and the byrdes shall eate thy flesh from of the.

20. And it came to passe the thyrde daye which was Pharaos byrth daye that he made a feast vnto all his servauntes. And he lyfted vpp the head of the chefe buttelar and of the chefe baker amonge his servauntes.

21. And restored the chefe buttelar vnto his buttelarshipe agayne and he reched the cuppe in to Pharaos hande

22. ad hanged the chefe baker: eue as Ioseph had interpretated vnto the.

23. Notwithstonding the chefe buttelar remembred not Ioseph but forgat hym.

## Genesis 41

1. And it fortuned at .ij. yeres end that Pharao dreamed and thought that he stode by a ryuers syde and that there came out of the ryver

2. .vij. goodly kyne and fatt fleshed and fedd in a medowe.

3. And him though that .vij. other kyne came vp after them out of the ryver euelfauored and leane fleshed and stode by the other vpon the brynke of the ryuer.

4. And the evill favored and Ienefleshed kyne ate vp the .vij. welfauored and fatt kyne: and be awoke their with.

5. And he slepte agayne and dreamed the second tyme that .vij. eares of corne grewe apon one stalke rancke and goodly.

6. And that .vij. thynne eares blasted with the wynde spronge vp after them:

7. and that the .vij. thynne eares deuowrerd the .vij. rancke and full eares. And than Pharao awaked: and se here is his dreame.

8. When the mornynge came his sprete was troubled And he sent and casted for all the soythsayers of Egypte and all the wyse men there of and told them his dreame: but there was none of them that coude interpretate it vnto Pharao.

9. Than spake the chefe buttelar vnto Pharao saynge. I do remembre my fawte this daye.

10. Pharao was angrie with his servauntes and put in warde in the chefe marshals house both me and the chefe baker.

11. And we dreamed both of vs in one nyght and ech mannes dreame of a sondrye interpretation.

12. And there was with vs a yonge man an Hebrue borne servaunte vnto the chefe marshall. And we told him and he declared oure dreames to vs acordynge to ether of oure dreames.

13. And as he declared them vnto vs euen so it came to passe. I was restored to myne office agayne and he was hanged.

14. Than Pharao sent and called Ioseph. And they made him haste out of preson. And he shaued him self and chaunged his rayment and went in to Pharao.

15. And Pharao sayde vnto Ioseph: I haue dreamed a dreame and no man ca interpretate it but I haue herde saye of the yt as soon as thou hearest a dreame thou dost interpretate it.

16. And Ioseph answered Pharao saynge: God shall geue Pharao an answere of peace without me.

17. Pharao sayde vnto Ioseph: in my dreame me thought I stode by a ryvers syde and there came out of the ryver

18. vij fatt fleshed ad well fauored kyne and fedd in the medowe.

19. And then .vij. other kyne came vp after them poore and very euell fauored ad leane fleshed: so that I neuer sawe their lyke in all the lande of Egipte in euell fauordnesse.

20. And the .vij. leane and euell fauored kyne ate vpp the first .vij. fatt kyne

21. And when they had eaten them vp a man cowde not perceaue that they had eate them: for they were still as evyll fauored as they were at the begynnynge. And I awoke.

22. And I sawe agayne in my dreame .vij. eares sprynge out of one stalk full and good

23. and .vij. other eares wytherd thinne and blasted with wynde sprynge vp after them.

24. And the thynne eares deuowred the .vij. good cares. And I haue tolde it vnto the sothsayers but no man can tell me what it meaneth.

25. Then Ioseph sayde vnto Pharao: both Pharaos dreames are one. And god doth shewe Pharao what he is aboute to do.

26. The vij. good kyne are .vij yeare: and the .vij. good eares are .vij. yere also and is but one dreame.

27. Lykewyse the .vij. thynne and euell fauored kyne that came out after them are .vij. yeares: and the .vij. emptie and blasted eares shalbe vij. yeares of hunger.

28. This is that which I sayde vnto Pharao that God doth shewe Pharao what he is aboute to doo.

29. Beholde there shall come .vij. yere of great plenteousnes through out all the lande of Egypte.

30. And there shall aryse after them vij. yeres of hunger. So that all the plenteousnes shalbe forgeten in the lande of Egipte. And the hunger shall consume the lande:

31. so that the plenteousnes shall not be once asene in the land by reason of that hunger that shall come after for it shalbe exceading great

32. And as concernynge that the dreame was dubled vnto Pharao the second tyme it belokeneth that the thynge is certanly prepared of God ad that God will shortly brynge it to passe.

33. Now therfore let Pharao provyde for a man of vnderstondynge and wysdome and sett him over the lande of Egipte.

34. And let Pharao make officers ouer the lande and take vp the fyfte parte of the land of Egipte in the vij. plenteous yeres

35. and let them gather all the foode of these good yeres that come ad lay vp corne vnder the power of Pharo: that there may be foode in the cities

36. and there let them kepte it: that there may be foode in stoore in the lande agaynst the .vij. yeres of hunger which shall come in the lande of Egipte and that the lande perishe not thorow hunger.

37. And the saynge pleased Pharao ad all his seruauntes.

38. Than sayde Pharao vnto his seruavauntes: where shall we fynde soch a ma as this is that hath the sprete of God in him?

39. wherfore Pharao sayde vnto Ioseph: for as moch as God hath shewed the all this there is no man of vnderstondyng nor of wysdome lyke vnto the

6. And he ouertoke them and sayde the same wordes vnto them.

7. And they answered him: wherfore sayth my lorde soch wordes? God forbydd that thy servauntes shulde doo so.

8. Beholde the money which we founde in oure sackes mouthes we brought agayne vnto the out of the lande of Canaa: how then shulde we steale out of my lordes house ether syluer or golde?

9. with whosoeuer of thy seruauntes it be founde let him dye and let vs also be my lordes bondmen.

17. And he answered: God forbyd ye I shulde do so the man with whom the cuppe is founde he shalbe my seruaunte: but goo ye in peace vn to youre father.

18. Then Iuda went vnto him and sayde: oh my lorde let thy servaunte speake a worde in my lordes audyence and be not wrooth with thi servaunte: for thou art euen as Pharao.

19. My lorde axed his seruaunte sainge: haue ye a father or a brother?

20. And we answered my lord we haue a father that is old and a yonge lad which he begat in his age: ad the brother of the sayde lad is dead and he is all that is left of that mother. And his father loueth him.

21. Then sayde my lorde vnto his seruauntes brynge him vnto me that I maye sett myne eyes apon him.

22. And we answered my lorde that the lad coude not goo from his father for if he shulde leaue his father he were but a deed man.

23. Than saydest thou vnto thy servauntes: excepte youre yongest brother come with you loke that ye se my face no moare.

28. And the one went out from me and it is sayde of a suertie that he is torne in peaces of wyld beastes and I sawe him not sence.

29. Yf ye shall take this also awaye fro me and some mysfortune happen apon him then shall ye brynge my gray heed with sorow vnto the grave.

30. Now therfore whe I come to thy servaunt my father yf the lad be not with me: seinge that his lyfe hageth by the laddes lyfe

31. then as soone as he seeth that the lad is not come he will dye. So shall we thy servautes brynge the gray hedde of thy servaunt oure father with sorow vnto the grave.

32. For I thy servaunt became suertie for the lad vnto my father and sayde: yf I bringe him not vnto the agayne. I will bere the blame all my life loge.

33. Now therfore let me thy servaunt byde here for ye lad and be my lordes bondman: and let the lad goo home with his brethern.
