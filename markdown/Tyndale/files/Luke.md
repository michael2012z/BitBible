## Luke 1

1. For as moche as many have take in hand to compyle a treates of thoo thinges which are surely knowen amonge vs

2. even as they declared them vnto vs which from the beginnynge sawe them their selves and were ministers at the doyng:

3. I determined also assone as I had searched out diligently all thinges from the beginnynge that then I wolde wryte vnto the good Theophilus:

4. that thou myghtest knowe the certente of thoo thinges wher of thou arte informed.

5. There was in the dayes of Herode kynge of Iurie a certayne prest named Zacharias of ye course of Abia. And his wyfe was of ye doughters of Aaron: And her name was Elizabeth.

6. Booth were perfect before God and walked in all the lawes and ordinaces of the Lorde that no man coulde fynde fawte with them.

7. And they had no chylde because that Elizabeth was barre and booth were well stricken in age.

8. And it cam to passe as he executed the prestes office before god as his course came

9. (accordinge to the custome of the prestes office) his lot was to bourne incece.

10. And wet into ye teple of ye Lorde and the whoale multitude of ye people were with out in prayer whill the incense was aburnynge.

11. And ther appered vnto him an angell of the lorde stondinge on the ryght syde of the altare of incense.

12. And when Zacharias sawe him he was abasshed and feare came on him.

13. And the angell sayde vnto him: feare not Zachary for thy prayer is hearde: And thy wyfe Elizabeth shall beare ye a sonne and thou shalt call his name Iohn

14. and thou shalt have ioye and gladnes and many shall reioyce at his birth.

15. For he shalbe greate in the sight of the lorde and shall nether drinke wyne ner stronge drinke. And he shalbe filled with the holy goost even in his mothers wombe:

16. and many of the chyldren of Israel shall he tourne to their Lorde God.

17. And he shall goo before him in the sprete and power of Helyas to tourne the hertes of the fathers to the chyldren and the vnbelevers to the wysdom of the iuste men: to make the people redy for the Lorde.

18. And Zacharias sayde vnto ye angell: Wher by shall I knowe this? seinge that I am olde and my wyfe well stricken in yeares.

19. And the angell answered and sayde vnto him: I am Gabriell that stonde in the presens of God and am sent to speake vnto the: and to shewe the these glad tydinges.

20. And beholde thou shalt be domme and not able to speake vntyll the tyme that these thinges be performed because thou belevedst not my wordes which shalbe fulfilled in their season.

21. And the people wayted for Zacharias and mervelled that he taryed in the temple.

22. And whe he cam oute he could not speake vnto them. Wherby they perceaved that he had sene some vision in the temple. And he beckened vnto them and remayned speachlesse.

23. And it fortuned assone as ye tyme of his office was oute he departed home into his awne housse.

24. And after thoose dayes his wyfe Elizabeth coceaved and hyd her sylfe .v. monethes sayinge:

25. This wyse hath God dealte wt me in ye dayes when he loked on me to take from me the rebuke yt I suffred amonge men.

26. And in ye .vi. moneth ye angell Gabriel was sent fro god vnto a cite of Galile named Nazareth

27. to a virgin spoused to a man whose name was Ioseph of ye housse of David and ye virgins name was Mary.

28. And ye angell went in vnto her and sayde: Hayle full of grace ye Lorde is with ye: blessed arte thou amonge wemen.

29. When she sawe him she was abasshed at his sayinge: and cast in her mynde what maner of salutacion yt shuld be.

30. And ye angell sayde vnto her: feare not Mary: for thou hast founde grace wt god.

31. Loo: thou shalt coceave in thy wombe and shalt beare a sonne and shalt call his name Iesus.

32. He shalbe greate and shalbe called the sonne of the hyest. And ye lorde God shall geve vnto him the seate of his father David

33. and he shall raygne over ye housse of Iacob forever and of his kyngdome shalbe none ende.

34. Then sayd Mary vnto ye angell: How shall this be seinge I knowe not a man?

35. And ye angell answered and sayd vnto her: The holy goost shall come apon the and ye power of ye hyest shall over shaddowe ye. Therfore also yt holy thinge which shalbe borne shalbe called ye sonne of god.

36. And beholde thy cosen Elizabeth she hath also conceaved a sonne in her age. And this is hyr sixte moneth though she be called barren:

37. for wt god can nothinge be vnpossible.

38. And Mary sayd: beholde ye honde mayden of ye lorde be it vnto me even as thou hast sayde. And the angell departed from her.

39. And Mary arose in thoose dayes and went into ye mountayns wt hast into a cite of Iurie

40. and entred into the housse of zachary and saluted Elizabeth.

41. And it fortuned as Elizabeth hearde ye salutacion of Mary the babe spronge in her belly. And Elizabeth was filled with the holy goost

42. and cryed with a loude voyce and sayde: Blessed arte thou amonge wemen and blessed is the frute of thy wombe.

43. And whence hapeneth this to me that the mother of my Lorde shuld come to me?

44. For loo assone as the voyce of thy salutacion sownded in myne eares the babe sprange in my belly for ioye.

45. And blessed arte thou that belevedst: for thoose thinges shalbe performed wich were tolde ye from the lorde.

46. And Mary sayde. My soule magnifieth the Lorde.

47. And my sprete reioyseth in god my savioure

48. For he hath loked on the povre degre of his honde mayde. Beholde now from hence forth shall all generacions call me blessed.

49. For he that is myghty hath done to me greate thinges and holye is his name.

50. And his mercy is on them that feare him thorow oute all generacions.

51. He sheweth strength with his arme he scattereth them that are proude in the ymaginacion of their hertes.

52. He putteth doune the myghty from their seates and exalteth them of lowe degre.

53. He filleth the hongry with good thinges: and sendeth awaye the ryche emptye.

54. He remenbreth mercy: and helpeth his servaunt Israel.

55. Even as he promised to oure fathers Abraham and to his seede for ever.

56. And mary aboode with hyr aboute a .iii. monethes and retourned agayne to hyr awne housse.

57. Elizabethes tyme was come that she shuld be delyvered and she brought forth a sonne.

58. And her neghboures and her cosins hearde tell how the lorde had shewed great mercy vpon her and they reioysed with her.

59. And it fortuned ye eyght daye: they cam to circumcise the chylde: and called his name zacharias after the name of his father.

60. How be it his mother answered and sayd: not so but he shalbe called Ihon.

61. And they sayd vnto hyr: Ther is none of thy kynne that is named wt this name.

62. And they made signes to his father how he wolde have him called.

63. And he axed for wrytynge tables and wroote saying: his name is Iohn. And they marvelled all.

64. And his mouthe was opened immediatly and his tonge also and he spake lawdynge God.

65. And feare came on all the that dwelt nye vnto them. And all these sayinges were noysed abroade throughout all ye hyll coutre of Iurie

66. and all they yt herde the layde them vp in their hertes saying: What maner chylde shall this be? And the honde of ye lorde was with him.

67. And his father zacharias was filled with the holy goost and prophisyed sayinge:

68. Blessed be the Lorde God of Israel for he hath visited and redemed his people.

69. And hath reysed vp an horne of salvacion vnto vs in the housse of his servaunt David.

70. Even as he promised by ye mouth of his holy prophetes which were sens ye worlde began

71. That we shuld be saved from oure enemies and from the hondis of all that hate vs:

72. To fulfill the mercy promised to oure fathers and to remember his holy covenaunt.

73. And to performe the oothe which he sware to oure father Adraham

74. for to geve vs. That we delyvered oute of ye hondes of oure enemyes myght serve him with oute feare

75. all the dayes of oure lyfe in suche holynes and ryghtewesnes that are accept before him.

76. And thou chylde shalt be called the Prophet of the hyest: for thou shalt goo before the face of the lorde to prepare his wayes:

77. And to geve knowlege of salvacion vnto his people for the remission of synnes:

78. Through the tender mercy of oure God wherby the daye springe from an hye hath visited vs.

79. To geve light to the that sate in darcknes and in shadowe of deth and to gyde oure fete into the waye of peace.

80. And the chylde grew and wexed stronge in sprete and was in wyldernes tyll the daye cam when he shuld shewe him sylfe vnto the Israhelites.

## Luke 2

1. And it chaunced in thoose dayes: yt ther went oute a comaundment from Auguste the Emperour that all the woorlde shuld be taxed.

2. And this taxynge was ye fyrst and executed when Syrenius was leftenaut in Syria.

3. And every man went vnto his awne citie to be taxed.

4. And Ioseph also ascended from Galile oute of a cite called Nazareth into Iurie: vnto ye cite of David which is called Bethleem because he was of the housse and linage of David

5. to be taxed with Mary his spoused wyfe which was with chylde.

6. And it fortuned whyll they were there her tyme was come that she shuld be delyvered.

7. And she brought forth her fyrst begotten sonne and wrapped him in swadlynge cloothes and layed him in a manger because ther was no roume for them within in the ynne.

8. And ther were in the same region shepherdes abydinge in the felde and watching their flocke by nyght.

9. And loo: the angell of ye lorde stode harde by the and the brightnes of ye lorde shone rounde aboute them and they were soare afrayed.

10. But the angell sayd vnto them: Be not afrayed. For beholde I bringe you tydinges of greate ioye yt shal come to all ye people:

11. for vnto you is borne this daye in the cite of David a saveoure which is Christ ye lorde.

12. And take this for a signe: ye hall fynde ye chylde swadled and layed in a mager.

13. And streight waye ther was with the angell a multitude of hevenly sowdiers laudynge God and sayinge:

14. Glory to God an hye and peace on the erth: and vnto men reioysynge.

15. And it fortuned assone as the angels were gone awaye fro them in to heven the shepherdes sayd one to another: let vs goo eve vnto Bethleem and se this thynge that is hapened which the Lorde hath shewed vnto vs.

16. And they cam with haste and founde Mary and Ioseph and the babe layde in a mager.

17. And when they had sene it they publisshed a brode the sayinge which was tolde them of that chylde.

18. And all that hearde it wondred at those thinges which were tolde the of the shepherdes.

19. But Mary kept all thoose sayinges and pondered them in hyr hert.

20. And the shepherdes retourned praysinge and laudinge God for all that they had herde and sene evyn as it was told vnto them.

21. And when ye eyght daye was come yt the chylde shuld be circucised his name was called Iesus which was named of the angell before he was conceaved in the wombe.

22. And when the tyme of their purificacio (after the lawe of Moyses) was come they brought him to Hierusalem to present hym to ye Lorde

23. (as yt is written in the lawe of the Lorde: every man that fyrst openeth the matrix shalbe called holy to the Lorde)

24. and to offer (as it ys sayde in the lawe of the Lorde) a payre of turtle doves or two yonge pigions.

25. And beholde ther was a ma in Hierusalem whose name was Simeon. And the same ma was iuste and feared God and longed for the consolacion of Israel and the holy goost was in him.

26. And an answer was geven him of the holy goost that he shulde not se deethe before he had sene the lordes Christ.

27. And he came by inspiracion into the temple. And when the father and mother brought in the chylde Iesus to do for him after the custome of the lawe

28. then toke he him vp in his armes and sayde.

29. Lorde Now lettest thou thy seruaut departe in peace accordinge to thy promes.

30. For myne eyes have sene ye saveour sent fro ye

31. Wich thou hast prepared before the face of all people.

32. A light to lighten the gentyls and the glory of thy people Israel.

33. And his father and mother mervelled at those thinges which were spoke of him.

34. And Simeon blessed them and sayde vnto Mary his mother: beholde this chyld shalbe the fall and resurreccio of many in Israel and a signe which shalbe spoke agaynste.

35. And morover the swearde shall pearce thy soule yt the thoughtes of many hertes maye be opened.

36. And ther was a Prophetesse one Anna the doughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Aser: which was of a greate age and had lyved with an husbande. vii. yeres from her virginite.

37. And she had bene a wedowe aboute .iiii. scoore and .iiii. yere which went never oute of the temple but served God with fastinge and prayer nyght and daye.

38. And the same came forth that same houre and praysed the Lorde and spake of him to all that loked for redempcion in Hierusalem.

39. And assone as they had performed all thinges accordinge to the lawe of the Lorde they returned into Galile to their awne cite Nazareth.

40. And the chylde grewe and wexed stronde in sprete and was filled with wysdome and the grace of God was with hym.

41. And his father and mother went to Hierusalem every yeare at the feeste of ester.

42. And when he was .xii. yere olde they went vp to Hierusalem after the custome of the feeste.

43. And when they had fulfilled the dayes as they returned home the chylde Iesus boode styll in Hierusalem vnknowynge to his father and mother.

44. For they supposed he had bene in the copany and therfore came a days iorney and sought him amoge their kynsfolke and acquayntaunce.

45. And when they founde hym not they went backe agayne to Hierusalem and sought him.

46. And it fortuned after .iii. dayes that they founde him in the teple sittinge in the middes of the doctours both hearynge them and posinge them.

47. And all that hearde him mervelled at his wit and answers.

48. And when they sawe him they were astonyed. And his mother sayde vnto him: sonne why hast thou thus dealte with vs? Beholde thy father and I have sought the sorowenge.

49. And he sayde vnto the: how is it yt ye sought me? Wist ye not that I must goo aboute my fathers busines?

50. And they vnderstode not ye sayinge that he spake to them.

51. And he went with them and came to Nazareth and was obedient to the. But his mother kept all these thinges in her hert.

52. And Iesus increased in wisdom and age and in favoure with god and man.

## Luke 3

1. In the fiftenthe yeare of the raygne of Tiberius the Emperoure Pontius Pylate beinge leftenaut of Iurie and Herode beinge Tetrach of Galile and his brother Philip Tetrach in Iturea and in the region of Traconites and Lysanias the Tetrach of Abyline

2. when Anna and Cayphas were the hye prestes: the worde of God came vnto Iohn ye sonne of zacharias in the wildernes.

3. And he came in to all the coostes aboute Iordan preachynge the baptyme of repentaunce for the remission of synnes

4. at it is written in the boke of the sayinges of Esaias ye Prophet which sayeth: The voyce of a cryar in wyldernes prepare the waye of the Lorde make hys pathes strayght.

5. Every valley shalbe fylled and every moutayne and hyll shalbe brought lowe. And crocked thinges shalbe made streight: and the rough wayes shalbe made smoth:

6. and all flesshe shall se the saveour sent of God.

7. Then sayde he to the people that were come to be baptysed of him: O generacion of vipers who hath taught you to flye from the wrath to come?

8. Bringe forth due frutes of repentaunce and begynne not to saye in youre selves we have Abraham to oure father. For I saye vnto you: God is able of these stones to reyse vp chyldren vnto Abraham.

9. Now also ys the axe leyd vnto the rote of the trees: so yt every tree which bringeth not forth good frute shalbe hewe doune and caste in to ye fyre.

10. And the people axed him sayinge: What shall we do then?

11. He answered and sayde vnto them: He that hath two coottes let him parte with him that hath none: and he that hath meate let him do lyke wyse.

12. Then came ther Publicans to be baptised and sayde vnto him: Master what shall we do?

13. And he sayde vnto the: requyre no more then that which ys appoynted vnto you.

14. The soudyoures lyke wyse demaunded of hym sayinge: and what shall we do? And he sayde to them: Do violence to noo ma: nether trouble eny man wrongfully: but be content with youre wages.

15. As the people were in a doute and all men disputed in their hertes of Iohn whether he were very Christ:

16. Ihon answered and sayde to them all: I baptyse you wt water but a stronger then I cometh after me whose shue latchet I am not worthy to vnlouse: he will baptise you with the holy goost and with fyre:

17. which hath his fanne in his hond and will pourge his floore and will gader the corne into his barne: but the chaffe wyll he bourne with fyre that never shalbe quenched.

18. And many other thinges in his exhortacion preached he vnto the people.

19. Then Herode the Tetrach (when he was rebuked of him for Herodias his brother Philippes wyfe and for all the evyls which Herod had done)

20. added this above all and leyd Iohn in preson.

21. And yt fortuned as all the people receaved baptyme (and when Iesus was baptised and dyd praye) that heave was opened

22. and the holy goost came doune in a bodely shape lyke a dove vpo him and a voyce came fro heve sayinge: Thou arte my dere sonne in the do I delyte.

## Luke 4

1. Iesus then full of the holy goost returnyd fro Iordan and was caryed of ye sprete into wildernes

2. and was .xl. dayes tempted of the devyll. And in thoose dayes ate he no thinge. And when they were ended he afterward hongred.

3. And the devyll sayde vnto him: yf thou be the sonne of God comaunde this stone yt it be breed.

4. And Iesus answered hym sayinge: It is writte: man shall not live by breed only but by every worde of God.

5. And ye devyll toke him vp into an hye moutayne and shewed him all the kyngdoms of the worlde eve in ye twincklinge of an eye.

6. And ye devyll sayde vnto him: all this power will I geve ye every whit and the glory of the: for yt is delyvered to me and to whosoever I will I geve it.

7. Yf thou therfore wilt worshippe me they shalbe all thyne.

8. Iesus answered him and sayde: hence from me Sathan. For it is written: Thou shalt honour the Lorde thy God and him only serve.

9. And he caryed him to Ierusalem and set him on a pynacle of the temple and sayd vnto him: Yf thou be the sonne of God cast thy silfe doune from hens.

10. For it is written he shall geve his angels charge over the to kepe the

11. and with there hondis they shall stey the vp that thou dasshe not thy fote agaynst a stone.

12. Iesus answered and sayde to him it is sayd: thou shalt not tempte the Lorde thy God.

13. Assone as the devyll had ended all his temptacions he departed from him for a season.

14. And Iesus retourned by the power of ye sprete in to Galile and there went a fame of him thorowe oute all the regio roude aboute.

15. And he taught in their synagoges and was commended of all men.

16. And he came to Nazareth where he was noursed and as hys custome was went in to the synagoge on the Saboth dayes and stode vp for to rede.

17. And ther was delyvered vnto him ye boke of ye Prophete Esaias. And when he had opened the boke he founde the place where it was written.

18. The sprete of the lorde vpon me because he hath annoynted me: to preache ye gospell to ye poore he hath sent me: and to heale the broken harted: to preache delyverauce to the captive and sight to the blinde and frely to set at lyberte them that are brused

19. and to preache the acceptable yeare of the Lorde.

20. And he cloosed the booke and gave it agayne to the minister and sate doune. And the eyes of all that were in the synagoge were fastened on him.

21. And he began to saye vnto them. This daye is this scripture fulfilled in youre eares.

22. And all bare him witnes and wondred at the gracious wordes which proceded oute of his mouth and sayde: Is not this Iosephs sonne?

23. And he sayde vnto them: Ye maye very well saye vnto me this proverbe: Phisicion heale thy silfe. Whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum do the same here lyke wyse in thyne awne countre.

24. And he sayde verely I saye vnto you: No Prophet is accepted in his awne countre.

25. But I tell you of a truth many wyddowes were in Israell in the dayes of Helias when hevyn was shet thre yeres and syxe monethes when greate fammisshemet was throughoute all the londe

26. and vnto none of them was Helias sent save in to Sarephta besydes Sidon vnto a woma that was a widow.

27. And many lepers were in Israel in the tyme of Heliseus the Prophete: and yet none of them was healed savinge Naaman of Siria.

28. And as many as were in ye sinagoge when they herde that were filled with wrath:

29. and roose vp and thrust him oute of the cite and ledde him eve vnto the edge of the hill wher on their cite was bilte to cast him doune hedlynge.

30. But he went his waye eve thorow the myddes of them:

31. and came in to Capernaum a cyte of Galile and there taught the on the Saboth dayes.

32. And they were astonyed at his doctrine: for his preachige was wt power.

33. And in the synagoge ther was a ma which had a sprete of an vncleane devell and cryed with aloude voyce

34. sayinge: let me alone what hast thou to do with vs thou Iesus of Nazareth? Arte thou come to destroye vs? I knowe the what thou arte eve the holy of God.

35. And Iesus rebuked him sayinge: holde thy peace and come oute of him. And the devyll threwe him in the myddes of them and came oute of him and hurt him not.

36. And feare came on them all and they spake amonge them selves sayinge: what maner a thinge is this? For with auctorite and power he commaundeth the foule spretes and they come out?

37. And ye fame of him spreed abroode thorowoute all places of the countre round aboute.

38. And he roose vp and came oute of ye sinagoge and entred in to Simons housse. And Simos motherelawe was take with a greate fever and they made intercession to him for her.

39. And he stode over her and rebuked the fever: and it leeft her. And immediatly she arose and ministred vnto them.

40. When the sonne was doune all they that had sicke take with divers deseases brought them vnto him: and he layde his hondes on every one of them and healed them.

41. And devils also cam out of many of them crying and saying: thou arte Christ the sonne of God. And he rebuked them and suffered them not to speake: for they knewe that he was Christ.

42. Assone as it was daye he departed and went awaye into a desert place and ye people sought him and came to him and kept him that he shuld not departe from the.

43. And he sayde vnto the: I muste to other cities also preache the kyngdome of God: for therfore am I sent.

44. And he preached in the synagoges of Galile.

## Luke 5

1. It came to passe as the people preased vpon him to heare the worde of God that he stoode by the lake of Genezareth:

2. and sawe two shippes stonde by the lake syde but the fisshermen were gone out of the and were wasshynge their nettes.

3. And he entred in to one of the shippes which perteyned to Simon and prayed him that he wolde thrust out a litell from the londe. And he sate doune and taught the people out of the ship.

4. When he had leeft speakynge he sayde vnto Simon: Launche out in to the depe and let slippe youre nettes to make a draught

5. And Simon answered and sayde to him: Master we have labored all nyght and have taken nothinge. Neverthelater at thy worde I will loose forthe the net.

6. And when they had so done they inclosed a greate multitude of fisshes. And their net brake:

7. but they made signes to their felowes which were in the other ship that they shuld come and helpe the And they came: and filled bothe the shippes that they soncke agayne.

8. When Simon Peter sawe that he fell doune at Iesus knees sayinge: Lorde goo

9. fro me for I am a synfull man. For he was vtterly astonyed and all that were wt him at ye draught of fisshe which they toke:

10. and so was also Iames and Iohn ye sonnes of zebede which were parteners wt Simon. And Iesus sayde vnto Simon: feare not fro hence forthe thou shalt catche men.

11. And they brought the shippes to londe and forsoke all and folowed him.

12. And it fortuned as he was in a certayne cite: beholde ther was a man full of leprosy: and when he had spied Iesus he fell on his face and besought him sayinge: Lorde yf thou wilt thou canst make me cleane.

13. And he strethed forth ye hond and touched him sayinge: I will be thou cleane. And immediatly the leprosy departed from him.

14. And he warned him that he shuld tell no man: but that he shuld goo and shewe him selfe to the Preste and offer for his clensynge accordinge as Moses commaundement was for a witnes vnto them.

15. But so moche the moare went ther a fame abroade of him and moche people cam to geder to heare and to be healed of him of their infirmities.

16. And he kepte him silfe aparte in ye wildernesses and gave him silfe to prayer.

17. And it happened on a certayne daye that he taught: and ther sate the pharises: and docturs of lawe which were come out of all ye tounes of Galile Iurie and Hierusalem. And the power of the Lorde was to heale the.

18. And beholde me brought a man lyinge in his beed which was taken with a palsie: and sought meanes to brynge him in and to laye him before him.

19. And whe they coulde not finde by what waye they might bringe him in be cause of ye prease they wet vp on the toppe of ye housse and let him doune thorowe the tylinge beed and all in the middes before Iesus.

20. When he sawe their fayth he sayde vnto him: man thy synnes are forgeven the.

21. And the Scribes and the Parises begane to thinke sayinge: What felow is this which speaketh blasphemy? Who can forgeve synnes but God only?

22. When Iesus perceaved their thoughtes he answered and sayde vnto them: What thinke ye in youre hertes?

23. Whether is easyar to saye thy synnes are forgeve the or to saye: rise and walke?

24. But that ye maye knowe that the sonne of ma hath power to forgeve synnes on erth he sayde vnto ye sicke of the palsie: I saye to the aryse take vp thy beed and go home to thy housse.

25. And immediatly he rose vp before them and toke vp his beed where on he laye and departed to his awne housse praysinge God.

26. And they were all amased and they lauded God and were filled with feare sayinge: We have sene straunge thynges to daye.

27. And after that he went forthe and sawe a Publican named Levi sittinge at the receyte of custome and sayde vnto him: folow me.

28. And he leeft all roose vp and folowed him.

29. And that same Levi made him a greate feaste at home in his awne housse. And ther was a greate copany of publicans and of other that sate at meate with him.

30. And the Scribes and Pharises murmured agaynst his disciples sayinge: Why eate ye and drinke ye with publicas and synners?

31. Iesus answered and sayde vnto the: They yt are whole nede not of ye phisicion: but they yt are sicke.

32. I came not to call ye rightewes but synners to repentauce.

33. Then they sayde vnto him: Why do the disciples of Iohn fast often and praye and the disciples of ye Pharises also: and thine eate and drinke?

34. And he sayde vnto them: Can ye make ye chyldren of the weddinge fast as longe as ye brydgrome is present with the?

35. The dayes will come whe the brydgrome shalbe take awaye from them: then shall they fast in those dayes

36. Then he spake vnto them in a similitude: No ma putteth a pece of a newe garment in to an olde vesture: for yf he do: then breaketh he the newe and the pece that was taken out of the newe agreeth not wt the olde.

37. Also no ma poureth newe wyne into olde vessels. For yf he do the newe wyne breaketh the vessels and runneth out it silfe and the vessels perisshe:

38. But newe wyne must be poured into newe vessels and bothe are preserved.

39. Also no man yt drinketh olde wine strayght waye can awaye with newe for he sayeth ye olde is plesauter.

## Luke 6

1. It happened on an after saboth that he went thorow the corne felde and that his disciples plucked the eares of corne and ate and rubbed them in their hondes.

2. And certayne of the Pharises sayde vnto them: Why do ye that which is not laufull to do on the saboth dayes?

3. And Iesus answered them and sayde: Have ye not redde what David dyd when he him sylfe was anhungred and they which were with him:

4. how he went into the housse of God and toke and ate the loves of halowed breed and gave also to them which were with him: which was not laufull to eate but for the prestes only.

5. And he sayde vnto them: The sonne of man is Lorde of the saboth daye.

6. And it fortuned in a nother saboth also that he entred in to ye sinagoge and taught. And ther was a ma whose right honde was dryed vp.

7. And ye Scribes and Pharises watched him to se whether he wolde heale on the Saboth daye that they myght fynde an accusacion agaynst him.

8. But he knewe their thoughtes and sayde to the man which had ye wyddred honde: Ryse vp and stonde forthe in the myddes. And he arose and stepped forthe.

9. Then sayde Iesus vnto them: I will axe you a question: Whether is it laufull on the saboth dayes to do good or to do evill? to save lyfe or for to destroye it?

10. And he behelde them all in copasse and sayd vnto ye man: Stretche forth thy honde. And he dyd so and his honde was restored and made as whoole as the other.

11. And they were filled full of madnes and comuned one with another what they myght do to Iesu.

12. And it fortuned in thoose dayes that he went out into a mountayne for to praye and cotinued all nyght in prayer to god.

13. And assone as it was daye he called his disciples and of the he chose twelve which also he called apostles.

14. Simon who he named Peter: and Andrew his brother. Iames and Iho Philip and Bartlemew

15. Mathew and Thomas Iames the sonne of Alpheus and Simon called zelotes

16. and Iudas Iames sonne and Iudas Iscarioth which same was the traytour.

17. And he came doune with them and stode in the playne felde with the company of his disciples and agreate multitude of people out of all parties of Iurie and Ierusalem and from the see cooste of Tire and Sidon which came to heare hym and to be healed of their diseases:

18. and they also that were vexed with foule spretes and they were healed.

19. And all the people preased to touche him: for there went vertue out of him and healed them all.

20. And he lifted vp his eyes apon the disciples and sayde: Blessed be ye poore: for yours is the kyngdome of God.

21. Blessed are ye that honger now: for ye shalbe satisfied. Blessed are ye yt wepe now: for ye shall laugh.

22. Blessed are ye when men hate you and thrust you oute of their companye and rayle and abhorre youre name as an evyll thinge for the sonne of manes sake.

23. Reioyse ye then and be gladde: for beholde youre rewarde is greate in heven. After this manner their fathers entreated the Prophetes.

24. But wo be to you that are ryche: for ye have therin youre consolacion.

25. Wo be to you yt are full: for ye shall honger. Wo be to you that now laugh: for ye shall wayle and wepe.

26. Wo be to you when all men prayse you: for so dyd their fathers to the false prophetes.

27. But I saye vnto you which heare: Love youre enemyes. Do good to the which hate you.

28. Blesse the that course you. And praye for the which wrongfully trouble you.

29. And vnto him that smyteth the on the one cheke offer also ye other. And him that taketh awaye thy goune forbid not to take thy coote also.

30. Geve to every man that axeth of the. And of him that taketh awaye thy goodes axe them not agayne.

31. And as ye wolde that men shuld doo to you: so do ye to them lyke wyse.

32. If ye love the which love you: what thanke are ye worthy of? For the very synners love their lovers.

33. And yf ye do for them which do for you: what thanke are ye worthy of? For the very synners do even the same.

34. If ye lende to them of whome ye hoope to receave: what thanke shall ye have: for the very synners lende to synners to receave as moch agayne.

35. Wherfore love ye youre enemys do good and lende lokynge for nothinge agayne and youre rewarde shalbe greate and ye shalbe the chyldren of the hyest: for he is kynde vnto the vnkynde and to the evyll.

36.  Be ye therfore mercifull as youre father is mercifull.

37. Iudge not and ye shall not be Iudged. Condemne not: and ye shall not be condemned. Forgeve and ye shalbe forgeven.

38. Geve and yt shalbe geven vnto you: good measure pressed doune shaken to geder and runnynge over shall men geve into youre bosomes. For with what measure ye mete with ye same shall men mete to you agayne.

39. And he put forthe a similitude vnto the: Can the blynde leade ye blynde? Do they not both then fall into ye dyche?

40. The disciple is not above his master. Every ma shalbe perfecte even as his master is.

41. Why seyst thou a moote in thy brothers eye  considerest not ye beame yt is in thyne awne eye?

42. Ether how canest thou saye to thy brother: Brother let me pull out ye moote that is in thyne eye: when thou perceavest not the beame that is in thyne awne eye? Ypocrite cast out ye beame out of thyne awne eye fyrst and then shalt thou se perfectly to pull out the moote out of thy brothers eye.

43. It is not a good tree that bringeth forthe evyll frute: nether is that an evyll tree that bringeth forthe good frute

44. For every tree is knowen by his frute. Nether of thornes gader men fygges nor of busshes gader they grapes.

45. A good man out of the good treasure of his hert bringeth forthe that which is good. And an evyll man out of the evyll treasure of his hert bringeth forthe that which ys evyll. For of the aboundaunce of ye her his mouthe speakethe.

46. Why call ye me Master Master: and do not as I bid you?

47. whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayinges and dothe the same I will shewe you to whome he ys lyke.

48. He is like a man which bilt an housse: and digged depe and layde the foundacio on a rocke. Whe the waters arose the fludde bet apo that housse and coulde not move yt. For it was grounded apon a rocke.

49. But he that heareth and doth not is lyke a man that with out foundacion bylt an housse apon the erth agaynst which the fludde did bet: and it fell by and by. And ye fall of yt housse was greate.

## Luke 7

1. When he had ended all his sainges in the audience of the people he entred into Capernau

2. And a certayne Centurions seruaunte was sicke and redy to dye whom he made moche of.

3. And when he hearde of Iesu he sent vnto him the elders of the Iewes besechinge him yt he wolde come and heale his servaunt.

4. And they came to Iesus and besought him instantly sayinge: He is worthi that thou shuldest do this for him.

5. For he loveth oure nacion and hath bilt vs a sinagoge

6. And Iesus went with them.  And when he was not farre fro the housse the Centurio sent frendes to him sayinge vnto him: Lorde trouble not thy silfe: for I am not worthy yt thou shuldest enter vnder my roffe.

7. Wherfore I thought not my silfe worthy to come vnto the: but saye the worde and my servaunt shalbe whoole.

8. For I lyke wyse am a man vnder power and have vnder me soudiers and I saye vnto won goo: and he goeth. And to another come: and he cometh. And to my servaunt do this: and he doeth it.

9. When Iesus herde this he merveyled at him and turned him about and sayd to the people that folowed him: I saye vnto you I have not founde so greate faith noo not in Israel.

10. And they yt were sent turned backe home agayne and founde the servaunt that was sicke whoole.

11.  And it fortuned after that that he went into a cite called Naim and many of his disciples went wt him and moche people.

12. When he came nye to the gate of the cite: beholde ther was a deed man caried out which was ye only sonne of his mother and she was a widowe and moche people of the cite was with her.

13. And when ye lorde sawe her he had compassion on her and sayde vnto her: wepe not.

14. And he went and touched the coffyn and they yt bare him stode still. And he sayde: Yonge man I saye vnto the aryse.

15. And ye deed sate vp and beganne to speake. And he delyvered him to his mother.

16. And ther ca a feare on the all. And they glorified god sayinge: a greate prophet is rysen amoge vs and god hath visited his people

17. And this rumor of him wet forthe throughout all Iurie and thorowout all the regions which lye rounde about.

18. And ye disciples of Iohn shewed him of all these thinges.

19. And Iohn called vnto him .ii. of his disciples and sent the to Iesus sayinge: Arte thou he that shall come: or shall we loke for another?

20. When the men were come vnto him they sayde: Iohn baptiste sent vs vnto ye sayinge: Arte thou he that shall come: or shall we wayte for another?

21. And at yt same tyme he cured many of their infirmites and plages and of evyll spretes and vnto many that were blynde he gave sight

22. And Iesus answered and sayd vnto them: Goo youre wayes and shewe Iohn what thinges ye have sene and harde: how yt the blynde se the halt goo the lepers are clensed the deafe heare the deed aryse to the poore is the glad tydinges preached

23. and happy is he that is not offended by me.

24. When ye messengers of Iohn were departed he began to speake vnto ye people of Iohn What wet ye oute into ye wildernes for to se? went ye to se arede shaken wt ye wynde?

25. But what went ye out for tose? A ma clothed in soofte rayment? Beholde they which are gorgeously apparelled and lyve delicatly are in kynges courtes.

26. But what went ye forth to se? A prophete? Ye I saye to you and moare then a prophete

27. This is he of who it is wrytte: Beholde I sende my messenger before thy face to prepare thy waye before the.

28. For I saye vnto you: a greater prophete then Iohn amoge wemes chyldre is ther none. Neverthelesse one yt is lesse in ye kyngdo of god is greater the he

29. And all the people that hearde and the publicans iustified God and were baptised with the baptim of Iohn.

30. But the pharises and scribes despised ye counsell of god agaynst them selves and were not baptised of him.

31.  And ye lorde sayd: Wher vnto shall I lyke the men of this generacion and what thinge are they lyke?

32. They are lyke vnto chyldre sittynge in ye market place and cryinge one to another and sayinge: We have pyped vnto you and ye hahave not daunsed: we have mourned to you and ye have not wept.

33. For Iohn baptist cam nether eatynge breed ner drinkynge wyne and ye saye: he hath the devyll.

34. The sonne of man is come and eateth and drinketh and ye saye: beholde a man which is a glotton and a drinker of wyne a frende of publicans and synners.

35. Yet is wysdome iustified of all her chyldren.

36. And one of the pharises desyred him that he wolde eate with him. And he went into ye pharises housse and sate doune to meate.

37. And beholde a woman in that cite which was a synner assone as she knewe that. Iesus sate at meate in the pharises housse she brought an alablaster boxe of oyntmet

38. and she stode at his fete behynde him wepynge and beganne to wesshe his fete with teares and dyd wipe the with the heares of her heed and kyssed his fete and anoynted them with oyntment.

39. When the pharise which bade him sawe that he spake with in him sylfe sayinge: If this man were a prophete he wolde surely have knowen who and what maner woman this is which toucheth him for she is a synner.

40. And Iesus answered and sayde vnto him: Simon I have some what to saye vnto ye. And he sayd master saye on.

41. There was a certayne lender which had two detters ye one ought five hondred pence and the other fyfty.

42. When they had nothinge to paye he forgave the boothe. Which of them tell me will love him moost?

43. Simon answered and sayde: I suppose that he to whom he forgave moost. And he sayde vnto him: Thou hast truly iudged.

44. And he turned to the woman and sayde vnto Simon: Seist thou this woman? I entred into thy housse and thou gavest me noo water to my fete but she hath wesshed my fete with teares and wiped the with the heeres of her heed.

45. Thou gavest me no kysse: but she sence ye tyme I came in hath not ceased to kysse my fete

46. Myne heed wt oyle thou dydest not anoynte: but she hath annoynted my fete wt oyntmet.

47. Wherefore I saye vnto the: many synnes are forgeve her for she loved moche. To whom lesse is forgeven the same doeth lesse love.

48. And he sayde vnto her thy synnes are forgeven ye

49. And they yt sate at meate with him beganne to saye within them selves: Who is this which forgeveth synnes also?

50. And he sayde to ye woman: Thy faith hath saved the Goo in peace.

## Luke 8

1. And it fortuned after that that he him sylfe went throughout cities and tounes preachynge and shewinge ye kyngdom of God and the twelve with him.

2. And also certayne wemen which wer healed of evell spretes and infirmities: Mary called Magdalen out of whom went seven devyls

3. and Ioanna ye wyfe of Chusa Herodees stewarde and Susanna and many other: which ministred vnto the of their substaunce.

4. When moch people were gadred to gether and were come to him out of all cities he spake by a similitude.

5. A sower went out to sowe his seede: and as he sowed some fell by the waye syde and it was troden vnder fete and the foules of the ayre devoured it vp.

6. And some fell on ston and assone as it was spronge vp it widdred awaye because it lacked moystnes.

7. And some fell amonge thornes and ye thornes spronge vp with it and choked it.

8. And some fell on good grounde and sproge vp and bare frute an hondred foolde. And as he sayde these thinges he cryed: He that hath eares to heare let him heare.

9.  And his disciples axed him sayinge: what maner similitude is this?

10. And he sayde: vnto you is it geven to knowe the secretes of the kyngdom of God: but to other in similitudes that when they se they shuld not se: and when they heare they shuld not vnderstonde.

11. The similitude is this. The seede is ye worde of God.

12. Thoose yt are besyde the waye are they that heare and afterwarde cometh ye devyll and taketh awaye the worde out of their hertes lest they shuld beleve and be saved.

13. They on the stonnes are they which when they heare receave the worde with ioye. But these have noo rootes which for a whyle beleve and in tyme of temtacio goo awaye.

14. And yt which fell amonge thornes are they which heare and goo forth and are choked wt cares and wt riches and volupteous lyvinge and bringe forth noo frute.

15. That in ye good grounde are they which with a good and pure hert heare the worde and kepe it and bringe forth frute with pacience.

16.  No man lyghteth a candell and covereth it vnder a vessell nether putteth it vnder ye table: but setteth it on a candelsticke that they that enter in maye se ye lyght.

17. No thinge is in secret yt shall not come abroode: Nether eny thinge hyd that shall not be knowen and come to lyght.

18. Take hede therfore how ye heare. For whosoever hath to him shalbe geve: And whosoever hath not fro him shalbe take even that same which he supposeth that he hath.

19. Then came to him his mother and his brethren and coulde not come at him for prease.

20. And they tolde him sayinge: Thy mother and thy brethren stonde with out and wolde se the.

21. He answered and sayd vnto them: my mother and my brethren are these which heare the worde of God and do it.

22.  And it chaunsed on a certayne daye that he went into a shippe and his disciples also and he sayde vnto them: Let vs goo over vnto the other syde of the lake. And they Lanched forthe.

23. And as they sayled he fell a slepe and there arose a storme of wynde in ye lake and they were fylled with water and were in ieopardy.

24. And they went to him and awoke him sayinge: Master Master we are loost. Then he arose and rebuked the wynde and the tempest of water and they ceased and it wexed calme.

25. And he sayd vnto the: where is youre faith? They feared and wondred sayinge one to another: what felowe is this? for he comaundeth bothe the wyndes and water and they obey him?

26. And they sayled vnto the region of ye Gaderenites which is over agaynst Galile.

27. And as he went out to londe ther met him a certayne man out of ye cite which had a devyll longe tyme and ware noo clothes nether aboode in eny housse: but amonge graves.

28. When he sawe Iesus he cryed and fell doune before him and with a loude voyce sayde: What have I to do with the Iesus the sonne of the God moost hyest? I beseche the torment me not.

29. Then he comaunded ye foule sprete to come out of the man. For ofte tymes he caught him and he was bounde with chaynes and kept with fetters: and he brake the bondes and was caryed of the fende into wyldernes.

30.  And Iesus axed him sayinge: what is thy name? And he sayde: Legion because many devyls were entred into him.

31. And they besought him yt he wolde not comaunde the to goo out into ye depe.

32. And ther was there by an heerde of many swyne fedynge on an hyll: and they besought him yt he wolde soffre the to enter into the. And he soffred the.

33. Then went the devyls out of the man and entred into the swyne: And the heerd toke their course and ran heedlynge into the lake and were choked.

34. When the herdmen sawe what had chaunsed they fleed and tolde it in the cite and in the villages.

35. And they came out to se what was done: and came to Iesus and founde ye man out of who the devyls were departed sittynge at the fete of Iesus clothed and in his right mynde and they were afrayde.

36. They also wich sawe it tolde the by what meanes he yt was possessed of ye devyll was healed.

37. And all the whole multitude of ye cotrye of the Gaderenites besought him yt he wolde departe from the: for they were taken wt greate feare. And he gate him into the shippe and returned backe agayne.

38. Then the man out of whom the devyls were departed besought him yt he myght be wt him: But Iesus sent him awaye sayinge:

39. Goo home agayne into thyne awne housse and shewe what great thinges God hath done to ye. And he went his waye and preached thorow out all the cite what great thinges Iesus had done vnto him.

40.  And it fortuned when Iesus was come agayne that ye people receaved him. For they all wayted for him.

41. And beholde ther came a man named Iairus (and he was a ruler of ye synagoge) and he fell doune at Iesus fete and besought him yt he wolde come into his housse

42. for he had but a doughter only apon a twelve yere of age and she laye a dyinge. And as he went the people thronged him.

43. And a woman havynge an issue of bloud twelve yeres (which had spent all her substance amonge phisicios nether coulde be holpen of eny)

44. came behinde him and touched the hem of his garmet and immediatly her issue of bloud staunched.

45. And Iesus sayde: Who is it that touched me? when every man denyed Peter and they yt were with him sayde: Master the people thrust the and vexe the: and sayest thou who touched me?

46. And Iesus sayd: Some body touched me. For I perceave that vertue is gone out of me.

47. When the woman sawe that she was not hid she came trimblynge and fell at is fete and tolde him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediatly.

48. And he sayde vnto hyr: Doughter be of good comforte Thy faith hath made the hoale goo in peace.

49.  Whyll he yet spake there came one from ye rulers of the synagogis housse which sayde to him: thy doughter is deed disease not the master.

50. When Iesus hearde that He answered the father sayinge: Feare not beleve only and she shalbe made whole.

51. And when he came to ye housse he suffred no man to goo in with him save Peter Iames and Iohn and the father and the mother of the mayden.

52. Every body weept and sorowed for her. And he sayde: Wepe not: for she is not deed but slepeth.

53. And they lewgh him to scorne. For they knew that she was deed.

54. And he thrust the all out and caught her by the honde and cryed sayinge: Mayde aryse.

55. And hyr sprete came agayne and she roose strayght waye. And he commaunded to geve her meate.

56. And the father and the mother of hyr were astonyed. But he warned the that they shuld tell noo man what was done.

## Luke 9

1. Then called he the .xii. to gether and gave them power and auctorite over all devyls and that they myght heale diseases.

2. And he sent them to preache the kyngdome of God and to cure the sick.

3. And he sayd to them: Take nothinge to sucker you by ye waye: nether staffe nor scripe nether breed nether money nether have twoo cootes.

4. And whatsoever housse ye enter into there abyde and thence departe.

5. And whosoever will not receave you when ye go out of that cite shake of the very dust from youre fete for a testimony agaynst them.

6. And they went out and went thorow the tounes preachinge the gospell and healynge every wheare.

7. And Herod the tetrarch herde of all that was done of him and douted because that it was sayde of some that Iohn was rysen agayne from deeth:

8. and of some that Helyas had apered: and of other that one of the olde prophetes was rysen agayne.

9. And Herod sayde: Iohn have I behedded: who then is this of whom I heare suche thinges? And he desyred to se him.

10.  And the Apostles retourned and tolde him what great thinges they had done. And he toke them and went a syde into a solitary place nye to a citie called Bethsaida.

11. And ye people knewe of it and folowed him. And he receaved them and spake vnto them of the kyngdome of God and healed them that had nede to be healed.

12. And when ye daye beganne to weare awaye then came the twelve and sayde vnto him: sende ye people awaye that they maye goo into the tounes and villages roundabout and lodge and get meate for we are here in a place of wyldernes.

13. But he sayde vnto them: Geve ye the to eate. And they sayde. We have no moo but fyve loves and two fisshes except we shuld goo and bye meate for all this people.

14. And they were about a fyve thousand men. And he sayde to his disciples: Cause them to syt doune by fyfties in a company.

15. And they dyd soo and made them all syt doune.

16. And he toke the fyve loves and the two fisshes and loked vp to heven and blessed them and brake and gave to the disciples to set before ye people.

17. And they ate and were all satisfied. And ther was taken vp of that remayned to the twelve baskettes full of broken meate.

18. And it fortuned as he was alone prayinge his disciples were wt him and he axed the sayinge: Who saye ye people yt I am?

19. They answered and sayd: Iohn Baptist. Some saye Helyas. And some saye one of the olde prophetes is rysen agayne.

20. He sayde vnto the: Who saye ye that I am? Peter answered and sayde: thou arte the Christ of god.

21. And he warned and commaunded them that they shuld tell no man yt thinge

22. sayinge: that the sonne of man must suffre many thinges and be reproved of the elders and of the hye prestes and scribes and be slayne and the thirde daye ryse agayne.

23. And he sayde to them all yf eny man will come after me let him denye him sylfe and take vp his crosse dayly and folowe me.

24. Whosoever will save his lyfe shall lose it. And who soever shall lose his lyfe for my sake the same shall save it.

25. For what avauntageth it a man to wynne the whole worlde yf he loose him sylfe or runne in domage of him sylfe?

26. For whosoever is ashamed of me and of my sayinges: of him shall the sonne of man be ashamed when he cometh in his awne glorie and in the glorie of his father and of the holy angels.

27. And I tell you of a surety: There be some of the yt stonde here which shall not tast of deeth tyll they se ye kyngdome of god.

28.  And it folowed about an .viii. dayes after thoose sayinges that he toke Peter Iames and Iohn and went vp into a moutayne to praye.

29. And as he prayed ye facion of his countenaunce was changed and his garment was whyte and shoone.

30. And beholde two men talked wt him and they were Moses and Helyas

31. which appered gloriously and spake of his departinge which he shuld ende at Ierusalem.

32. Peter and they that were with him were hevy with slepe. And when they woke they sawe his glorie and two men stondinge with him.

33. And it chaunsed as they departed fro him Peter sayde vnto Iesus: Master it is good beinge here for vs. Let vs make thre tabernacles one for the and one for Moses and one for Helyas: and wist not what he sayde.

34. Whyll he thus spake ther came a cloude and shadowed them: and they feared when they were come vnder the cloude.

35. And ther came a voyce out of the cloude sayinge: This is my deare sonne heare him.

36. And assone as ye voyce was past Iesus was founde alone. And they kept it cloose and tolde noo man in thoose dayes eny of those thinges which they had sene.

37. And it chaunsed on the nexte daye as they came doune from the hyll moche people met him.

38. And beholde a man of the copany cryed out sayinge: Master I beseche ye beholde my sonne for he is all that I have:

39. and se a sprete taketh him and sodenly he cryeth and he teareth him that he fometh agayne and with moche payne departeth fro him when he hath rent him and

40. I besought thy disciples to cast him out and they coulde not.

41. Iesus answered and sayde: O generacion with oute fayth and croked: how longe shall I be with you? and shall suffre you? Bringe thy sonne hidder.

42. As he yet was a cominge the fende ret him and tare him. And Iesus rebuked ye vnclene sprete and healed the childe and delivered him to his father.

43. And they were all amased at ye mighty power of God.Whyll they wondred every one at all thinges which he dyd he sayd vnto his disciples:

44. Let these sayinges synke doune into youre eares. The tyme will come when the sonne of man shalbe delivered into the hondes of men.

45. But they wist not what yt worde meant and yt was hyd fro the that they vnderstode yt not. And they feared to axe him of that sayinge.

46.  Then ther arose a disputacion amoge the: who shuld be the greatest.

47. When Iesus perceaved ye thoughtes of their hertes he toke a chylde and set him hard by him

48. and sayd vnto the: Whosoever receaveth this chylde in my name receaveth me. And whosoever receaveth me receaveth him yt sent me. For he yt is least amonge you all the same shalbe greate.

49. And Iohn answered and sayde: Master we sawe one castinge out devyls in thy name and we forbade him because he foloweth not with vs.

50. And Iesus sayde vnto him: forbyd ye him not. For he that is not agaynst vs is wt vs.

51. And it folowed when the tyme was come yt he shulde be receaved vp then he set his face to goo to Hierusalem

52. and sent messengers before him. And they went and entred into a citie of the Samaritans to make redy for him.

53. But they wolde not receave him be cause his face was as though he wolde goo to Ierusalem.

54. When his disciples Iames and Iohn sawe yt they sayde: Lorde wilt thou that we comaunde that fyre come doune from heven and consume them even as Helias dyd?

55. Iesus turned about and rebuked them sayinge: ye wote not what maner sprete ye are of.

56. The sonne of ma ys not come to destroye mennes lives but to save them. And they went to another toune.

57.  And it chaunsed as he went in the waye a certayne man sayd vnto him: I will folowe the whither soever thou goo.

58. Iesus sayd vnto him: foxes have holes and bryddes of ye ayer have nestes: but the sonne of man hath not where on to laye his heed.

59. And he sayde vnto another: folowe me. And the same sayde: Lorde suffre me fyrst to goo and bury my father.

60. Iesus sayd vnto him: Let the deed bury their deed: but goo thou and preache the kyngdome of God.

61. And another sayde: I wyll folowe the Lorde: but let me fyrst goo byd them fare well which are at home at my housse.

62. Iesus sayde vnto him: No man that putteth his honde to the plowe and loketh backe is apte to the kyngdome of God.

## Luke 10

1. After these thinges the Lorde apoynted other seventie also and sent them two and two before him into every citie and place whither he him silfe wolde come.

2. And he sayde vnto them the harvest is greate: but the laborers are feawe. Praye therfore the Lorde of ye harvest to send forth laborers into his hervest.

3. Goo youre wayes: beholde I sende you forthe as lambes amonge wolves.

4. Beare noo wallet nether scryppe nor shues and salute noo man by the waye.

5. Into whatsoever housse ye enter fyrst saye: Peace be to this housse.

6. And yf ye sonne of peace be theare youre peace shall rest vpon him: yf not yt shall returne to you agayne.

7. And in ye same housse tary still eatinge and drinkinge soche as they have. For the laborer is worthy of his ewarde. Go not fro housse to housse:

8. and in to whatso ever citye ye enter yf they receave you eate soche thinges as are set before you

9. and heale the sicke yt are theare and saye vnto them: the kyngdome of God is come nye vpon you.

10. But into whatsoever citie ye shall enter yf they receave you not goo youre wayes out into the stretes of ye same and saye:

11. even the very dust which cleaveth on vs of your citie we wipe of agaynst you: Not withstondinge marke this that ye kyngdome of God was come nie vpon you.

12. Ye and I saye vnto you: that it shalbe easier in that daye for Sodom then for yt cytie.

13. Wo be to the Chorazin: wo be to ye Bethsaida. For yf ye miracles had bene done in Tyre and Sido which have bene done in you they had a greate whyle agone repeted sitting in heere and asshes.

14. Neverthelesse it shalbe easier for Tyre and Sidon at the iudgement then for you.

15. And thou Capernau which art exalted to heave shalt be thrust doune to hell.

16. He yt heareth you heareth me: and he that dispiseth you despiseth me: and he that dispiseth me despiseth him that sent me.

17. And the sevetie returned agayne with ioye sayinge: Lorde even the very devyls are subdued to vs thorowe thy name.

18. And he sayde vnto them: I sawe satan as it had bene lightenyng faule doune fro heave.

19. Beholde I geve vnto you power to treade on serpetes and scorpions and over all maner power of the enimye and no thinge shall hurte you.

20. Neverthelesse in this reioyse not that ye spretes are vnder youre power: but reioyse be cause youre names are wrytten in heaven.

21. That same tyme reioysed Iesus in ye sprete and sayde: I confesse vnto ye father Lorde of heaven and erth yt thou hast hyd these thynges from the wyse and prudent and hast opened them to the babes. Even so father for soo pleased it the.

22. All thinges are geven me of my father. And no man knoweth who the sonne is but the father: nether who the father is save the sonne and he to who the sonne wyll shewe him.

23. And he turned to his disciples and sayde secretly: Happy are ye eyes which se yt ye se.

24. For I tell you that many prophetes and kynges have desired to se those thinges which ye se and have not sene them: and to heare those thinges which ye heare and have not hearde them.

25. And beholde a certayne Lawere stode vp and tempted him sayinge: Master what shall I do to inheret eternall life?

26. He sayd vnto him: What is written in the lawe? How redest thou?

27. And he answered and sayde: Loue thy Lorde God with all thy hert and with all thy soule and with all thy stregthe and with all thy mynde: and thy neghbour as thy sylfe.

28. And he sayde vnto him: Thou hast answered right. This do and thou shalt live.

29. He willinge to iustifie him silfe sayde vnto Iesus: Who is then my neghbour?

30. Iesus answered and sayde: A certayne ma descended fro Hierusalem into Hierico and fell in to the hondes of theves which robbed him of his raymet and wounded him and departed levynge him halfe deed.

31. And by chaunce ther came a certayne preste that same waye and when he sawe him he passed by.

32. And lykewyse a Levite when he was come nye to the place wet and loked on him and passed by.

33. Then a certayne Samaritane as he iornyed came nye vnto him and when he sawe him had compassion on him

34. and went to and bounde vp his woundes and poured in oyle and wyne and put him on his awne beaste and brought him to a comen ynne and made provision for him.

35. And on the morowe when he departed he toke out two pece and gave them to the host and sayde vnto him. Take cure of him and whatsoever thou spedest moare when I come agayne I will recompence the.

36. Which now of these thre thynkest thou was neighbour vnto him yt fell into ye theves hondes?

37. And he sayde: he that shewed mercy on him. Then sayde Iesus vnto him. Goo and do thou lyke wyse.

38. It fortuned as they wet that he entred in to a certayne toune. And a certayne woman named Martha receaved him into her housse.

39. And this woman had a sister called Mary which sate at Iesus fete and hearde his preachinge.

40. And Martha was combred about moche servinge and stode and sayde: Master doest thou not care that my sister hath leeft me to minister alone? Byd her therfore that she helpe me.

41. And Iesus answered and sayde vnto her: Martha Martha thou carest and arte troubled about many thinges:

42. verely one is nedfull. Mary hath chosen her that good parte which shall not be taken awaye from her.

## Luke 11

1. And it fortuned as he was prayinge in a certayne place: when he ceased one of his disciples sayde vnto him: Master teache vs to praye as Iohn taught his disciples.

2. And he sayd vnto the: When ye praye saye: O oure father which arte in heave halowed be thy name. Thy kyngdome come. Thy will be fulfilled even in erth as it is in heaven.

3. Oure dayly breed geve vs evermore.

4. And forgeve vs oure synnes: For eve we forgeve every man yt treaspaseth vs. And ledde vs not into teptacio. But deliver vs fro evill.

5. And he sayde vnto them: if any of you shuld have a frede and shuld goo to him at mid nyght and saye vnto him: frende lende me thre loves

6. for a frende of myne is come out of the waye to me and I have nothinge to set before him:

7. and he within shuld answere and saye trouble me not the dore is now sheet and my servautes are with me in the chamber I canot ryse and geve them to the.

8. I saye vnto you though he wold not aryse and geve him because he is his frede: yet because of his importunite he wold rise and geve him as many as he neded.

9. And I saye vnto you: axe and it shalbe geven you. Seke and ye shall fynde. knocke and it shalbe opened vnto you.

10. For every one that axeth receaveth: and he that seketh fyndeth: and to him that knocketh shall it be openned.

11. Yf the sonne shall axe breed of eny of you that is a father: wyll he geve him a stone? Or yf he axe fisshe wyll he for a fysshe geve him a serpent?

12. Or yf he axe an egge: wyll he offer him a scorpion?

13. Yf ye then which are evyll canne geve good giftes vnto youre chyldren how moche more shall the father of heaven geve an holy sprete to them that desyre it of him?

14. And he was a castynge out a devyll which was dome. And it folowed when the devyll was gone out the domme spake and the people wondred.

15. But some of the sayde: he casteth out devyls by the power of Belzebub the chefe of the devyls.

16. And other tempted him sekinge of him a signe fro heave.

17. But he knewe their thoughtes and sayde vnto them: Every kingdome devided with in it silfe shalbe desolate: and one housse shall fall vpon another.

18. So if Satan be devided with in him silfe: how shall his kyngdome endure? Because ye saye that I cast out devyls by the power of Belzebub.

19. Yf I by the power of Belzebub caste oute devyls: by whome do youre chyldren cast them out? Therfore shall they be youre iudges.

20. But if I with ye finger of God cast out devyls noo doute the kyngdome of God is come vpon you.

21. When a stronge man armed watcheth his housse: yt he possesseth is in peace.

22. But when a stronger then he cometh vpo him and overcometh him: he taketh from him his harnes wherin he trusted and devideth his gooddes.

23. He that is not with me is agaynst me. And he that gadereth not with me scattereth.

24. When the vnclene sprete is gone out of a man he walketh through waterlesse places sekinge reest. And when he fyndeth none he sayeth: I will returne agayne vnto my housse whence I came out.

25. And when he cometh he fyndeth it swept and garnissed.

26. Then goeth he and taketh to him seve other spretes worsse then himsilfe: and they enter in and dwell there. And the ende of that man is worsse then the begynninge.

27. And it fortuned as he spake those thinges a certayne woman of the copany lyfte vp her voyce and sayde vnto him: Happy is the wombe that bare the and the pappes which gave the sucke.

28. But he sayde: Ye happy are they that heare the worde of God and kepe it.

29. When the people were gadered thicke to geder: he began to saye. This is an evyll nacion: they seke a signe and ther shall no signe be geven them but the signe of Ionas the Prophet.

30. For as Ionas was a signe to the Ninivites so shall ye sonne of ma be to this nacio.

31. The quene of the southe shall ryse at iudgement with the men of this generacio and condempne them: for she came fro the ende of the worlde to heare the wysdome of Salomon. And beholde a greater then Salomon is here.

32. The men of Ninive shall ryse at the iudgement wt this generacio and shall condepne the: for they repented at the preachinge of Ionas. And beholde a greater then Ionas is here.

33. Noo man lighteth a candell and putteth it in a previe place nether vnder a busshell: But on a candelsticke that they that come in maye se ye light.

34. The light of thy body is the eye. Therfore when thine eye is single: then is all thy body full of light. But if thine eye be evyll: then shall thy body also be full of darknes.

35. Take hede therfore that the light which is in the be not darknes.

36. For if all thy body shalbe light havynge noo parte darke: then shall all be full of light even as when a candell doeth light the with his brightnes.

37. And as he spake a certayne Pharise besought him to dyne with him: and he went in and sate doune to meate.

38. When the Pharise sawe that he marveylled yt he had not fyrst wesshed before dyner.

39. And ye Lorde sayde to him: Now do ye Pharises make clene the out side of the cup and of the platter: but youre inwarde parties are full of raveninge and wickednes.

40. Ye foles dyd not he that made that which is without: make that which is within also?

41. Neverthelesse geve almose of that ye have and beholde all is clene to you.

42. But wo be to you Pharises for ye tithe the mynt and rewe and all manner erbes and passe over iudgment and the love of God. These ought ye to have done and yet not to have left the other vndone.

43. Wo be to you Pharises: for ye love the vppermost seates in the synagoges and gretinges in the markets.

44. Wo be to you scribes and pharises ypocrites for ye are as graves which appere not and the men yt walke over the are not ware of the.

45. Then answered one of the lawears and sayd vnto him: Master thus sayinge thou puttest vs to rebuke also.

46. Then he sayde: Wo be to you also ye lawears: for ye lade men with burthens greveous to be borne and ye youre selves touche not ye packes wt one of youre fyngers.

47. Wo be to you: ye bylde the sepulchres of the Prophetes and youre fathers killed the:

48. truly ye beare witnes that ye alowe the dedes of youre fathers for they kylled them and ye bylde their sepulchres.

49. Therfore sayde ye wisdome of God: I will send them Prophetes and Apostles and of them they shall slee and persecute:

50. that the bloude of all Prophetes which was sheed fro the beginninge of the worlde maye be requyred of this generacion

51. from the bloud of Abell vnto the bloud of zachary which perisshed bitwene the aulter and the temple. Verely I saye vnto you: it shalbe requyred of this nacion.

52. Wo be to you lawears: for ye have taken awaye ye keye of knowledge ye entred not in youre selves and them that came in ye forbade.

53. When he thus spake vnto them the lawears and the Pharises began to wexe busye about him and to stop his mouth with many questions

54. layinge wayte for him and sekinge to catche somethinge of his mought wherby they might accuse him.

## Luke 12

1. As ther gadered together an innumerable multitude of people (in so moche that they trood one another) he began to saye vnto his disciples: Fyrst of all beware of the leve of the Pharises which is ypocrisy.

2. For ther is no thinge covered that shall not be vncovered: nether hyd that shall not be knowen.

3. For whatsoever ye have spoken in in darknes: that same shalbe hearde in light. And that which ye have spoken in the the eare eve in secret places shalbe preached even on the toppe of the housses.

4. I saye vnto you my fredes: Be not afrayde of them that kyll the body and after that have no moare that they can do.

5. But I will shewe you whom ye shall feare. Feare him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell. Ye I saye vnto you him feare.

6. Are not five sparowes bought for two farthinges? And yet not one of them is forgotten of God.

7. Also even the very heres of youre heedes are nombred. Feare not therfore: ye are moare of value then many sparowes.

8. I saye vnto you: Whosoever confesseth me before men eve him shall ye sonne of man confesse also before ye angels of God.

9. And he that denyeth me before men: shalbe denyed before ye angels of God.

10. And whosoever speaketh a worde agaynst ye sonne of ma it shalbe forgeven him. But vnto him yt blasphemeth the holy goost it shall not be forgeven.

11. When they bringe you vnto the synagoges and vnto the rulers and officers take no thought how or what thinge ye shall answer or what ye shall speake.

12. For the holy goost shall teache you in the same houre what ye ought to saye.

13. One of the company sayde vnto hym: Master byd my brother devide the enheritauce with me.

14. And he sayde vnto him: Man who made me a iudge or a devider over you?

15. Wherfore he sayde vnto them: take hede and beware of covetousnes. For no mannes lyfe stondeth in the aboundaunce of the thinges which he possesseth.

16. And he put forth a similitude vnto them sayinge: The groude of a certayne riche ma brought forth frutes plenteously

17. and he thought in himsilfe sayinge: what shall I do? because I have noo roume where to bestowe my frutes?

18. And he sayde: This will I do. I will destroye my barnes and bilde greater and therin will I gadder all my frutes and my goodes:

19. and I will saye to my soule: Soule thou hast moch goodes layde vp in stoore for many yeares take thyne ease: eate drinke and be mery.

20. But God sayde vnto him: Thou fole this night will they fetche awaye thy soule agayne from the. Then whose shall thoose thinges be which thou hast provyded?

21. So is it with him that gadereth ryches and is not ryche in God.

22. And he spake vnto his disciples: Therfore I saye vnto you: take no thought for youre lyfe what ye shall eate nether for youre body what ye shall put on.

23. The lyfe is moare then meate and the bodye is moare then rayment.

24. Considre the ravens for they nether sowe nor repe which nether have stoorehousse ner barne and yet God fedeth them. How moche are ye better then the foules.

25. Which of you with takynge thought can adde to his stature one cubit?

26. Yf ye then be not able to do that thinge which is least: why take ye thought for the remmaunt?

27. Considre the lylies how they growe: They laboure not: they spyn not: and yet I saye vnto you that Salomon in all this royalte was not clothed lyke to one of these.

28. Yf the grasse which is todaye in the felde and tomorowe shalbe cast into the fornace God so clothe: how moche moore will he clothe you o ye endued wt litell faith?

29. And axe not what ye shall eate or what ye shall drinke nether clyme ye vp an hye

30. for all suche thinges the hethen people of the worlde seke for. Youre father knoweth that ye have nede of suche thinges.

31. Wherfore seke ye after the kyngedome of God and all these thinges shalbe ministred vnto you.

32. Feare not litell floocke for it is youre fathers pleasure to geve you a kingdome.

33. Sell that ye have and geve almes. And make you bagges which wexe not olde and treasure that fayleth not in heaven where noo these commeth nether moth corrupteth.

34. For where youre treasure is there will youre hertes be also.

35. Let youre loynes be gerdde about and youre lightes brennynge

36. and ye youre selves lyke vnto men that wayte for their master when he will returne fro a weddinge: that assone as he cometh and knocketh they maye ope vnto him.

37. Happy are those servauntes which the Lorde when he cometh shall fynde wakynge. Verely I saye vnto you he will gerdde him selfe about and make them sit doune to meate and walke by and minister vnto them.

38. And yf he come in the seconde watche ye if he come in the thyrde watche and shall fynde them soo happy are those servauntes.

39. This vnderstonde that yf the good man of the housse knewe what houre ye these wolde come he wolde suerly watche: and not suffer his housse to be broken vp.

40. Be ye prepared therfore: for the sonne of man will come at an houre when ye thinke not.

41. Then Peter sayde vnto him: Master tellest thou this similitude vnto vs or to all men?

42. And the Lorde sayde: If there be any faith full servaut and wise whom his Lorde shall make ruler over his housholde to geve them their duetie of meate at due season:

43. happy is that servaunt whom his master when he cometh shall finde soo doinge.

44. Of a trueth I saye vnto you: that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.

45. But and yf the evyll servaunt shall saye in his hert: My master wyll differre his cominge and shall beginne to smyte the servauntes and maydens and to eate and drinke and to be dronken:

46. the Lorde of that servaunt will come in a daye when he thinketh not and at an houre when he is not ware and will devyde him and will geve him his rewarde with the vnbelevers.

47. The servaut that knewe his masters will and prepared not him selfe nether dyd accordinge to his will shalbe bete with many strypes.

48. But he that knewe not and yet dyd committe thinges worthy of strypes shalbe beaten with feawe strypes. For vnto whom moche is geven of him shalbe moche requyred. And to whom men moche commyt the moare of him will they axe.

49. I am come to sende fyre on erth: and what is my dysyre but that it were all redy kyndled?

50. Not with stondinge I must de baptised with a baptyme: and how am I payned till it be ended?

51. Suppose ye that I am come to sende peace on erth? I tell you naye: but rather debate.

52. For fro hence forthe ther shalbe five in one housse devided thre agaynst two and two agaynst thre.

53. The father shalbe devided agaynst the sonne and the sonne agaynst the father. The mother agaynst the doughter and the doughter agaynst the mother. The motereleawe agaynst hir doughterelawe and the doughterelawe agaynst hir motherelawe.

54. Then sayde he to the people: when ye se a cloude ryse out of the west strayght waye ye saye: we shall have a shower and soo it is.

55. And when ye se the south wynde blow ye saye: we shall have heet and it cometh to passe.

56. Ypocrites ye can skyll of the fassion of the erth and of the skye: but what is ye cause that ye canot skyll of this time?

57. Ye and why iudge ye not of youre selves what is righte?

58. Whill thou goest with thyne adversary to the ruler: as thou arte in the waye geve diligence that thou mayst be delivered fro him least he bringe the to the iudge and the iudge delyver the to the iaylar and the iaylar cast the in to preson.

59. I tell ye thou departest not thence tyll thou have made good ye vtmost myte.

## Luke 13

1. Ther were present at the same season that shewed him of ye Galileas whose bloude Pylate mengled with their awne sacrifice.

2. And Iesus answered and sayde vnto them: Suppose ye that these Galileans were greater synners then all the other Galileas because they suffred suche punisshmet?

3. I tell you naye: but except ye repent ye shall all in lyke wyse perysshe.

4. Or those .xviii. apon which ye toure in Syloe fell and slewe the thinke ye that they were synners above all men yt dwell in Ierusalem?

5. I tell you naye: But excepte ye repent ye all shall lykewyse perisshe.

6. He put forthe this similiiude A certayne man had a fygge tree planted in his veneyarde and he came and sought frute theron and founde none.

7. Then sayde he to ye dresser of his vyneyarde: Beholde this thre yeare have I come and sought frute in this fygge tree and fynde none: cut it doune: why combreth it the grounde?

8. And he answered and sayde vnto him: lorde let it alone this yeare also till I digge rounde aboute it and doge it to se

9. whether it will beare frute: and if it beare not then after yt cut it doune

10. And he taught in one of their sinagoges on ye saboth dayes.

11. And beholde ther was a woma which had a sprete of infirmite .xviii. yeares: and was bowed to gether and coulde not lifte vp hersilfe at all.

12. When Iesus sawe her he called her to him and sayde to her: woman thou arte delyvered from thy disease.

13. And he layde his hondes on her and immediatly she was made strayght and glorified God.

14. And the ruler of the sinagoge answered with indignacion (be cause that Iesus had healed on the saboth daye) and sayde vnto the people. Ther are sixe dayes in which men ought to worke: in them come and be healed and not on the saboth daye.

15. Then answered him the Lorde and sayd: Ypocrite doth not eache one of you on the saboth daye lowse his oxe or his asse from the stall and leade him to the water?

16. And ought not this doughter of Abraham whom Sathan hath bounde loo .xviii. yeares be lowsed from this bonde on the saboth daye?

17. And when he thus sayde all his adversaries were ashamed and all the people reioysed on all the excellent dedes that were done by him.

18. Then sayde he: What is the kyngdome of God lyke? or wherto shall I compare it?

19. It is lyke a grayne of mustard seede which a man toke and sowed in his garden: and it grewe and wexed a greate tree and the foules of the ayer made nestes in the braunches of it.

20. And agayne he sayde: wher vnto shall I lyken ye kyngdome of god?

21. it is lyke leve which a woman toke and hidde in thre busshels of floure tyll all was thorow levended.

22. And he went thorow all maner of cities and tounes teachinge and iorneyinge towardes Ierusalem.

23. Then sayde one vnto him: Lorde are ther feawe that shalbe saved? And he sayde vnto them:

24. stryve with youre selves to enter in at ye strayte gate: For many I saye vnto you will seke to enter in and shall not be able.

25. When the good man of ye housse is rysen vp and hath shett to the dore ye shall beginne to stonde with out and to knocke at the dore sayinge: Lorde lorde open vnto vs: and he shall answer and saye vnto you: I knowe you not whence ye are.

26. Then shall ye begin to saye. We have eaten in thy presence and dronke and thou hast taught in oure stretes.

27. And he shall saye: I tell you I knowe you not whence ye are: departe from me all ye workers of iniquite.

28. There shalbe wepinge and gnasshinge of teth when ye shall se Abraham and Isaac and Iacob and all the prophetes in the kyngdom of God and youre selves thrust oute at dores.

29. And they shall come from the eest and from the weest and from the northe and from the southe and shall syt doune in the kyngdome of God.

30. And beholde ther are last which shalbe fyrst: And ther are fyrst which shalbe last.

31. The same daye there came certayne of the pharises and sayd vnto him: Get the out of the waye and departe hence: for Herode will kyll ye.

32. And he sayd vnto them. Goo ye and tell that foxe beholde I cast oute devyls and heale the people to daye and to morowe and the third daye I make an ende.

33. Neverthelesse I must walke todaye and tomorowe and the daye folowinge: For it cannot be that a Prophet perishe eny other where save at Ierusalem.

34. O Ierusalem Ierusalem which kyllest prophetes and stonest them that are sent to ye: how often wolde I have gadered thy childre to gedder as the hen gathereth her nest vnder her wynges but ye wolde not.

35. Beholde youre habitacion shalbe left vnto you desolate. For I tell you ye shall not se me vntill the tyme come that ye shall saye blessed is he that commeth in the name of the Lorde.

## Luke 14

1. And it chaunsed that he went into the housse of one of ye chefe pharises to eate breed on a saboth daye: and they watched him.

2. And beholde ther was a man before him which had the dropsye.

3. And Iesus answered and spake vnto the lawears and pharises sayinge: is it laufull to heale on the saboth daye?

4. And they helde their peace. And he toke him and healed him and let him goo:

5. and answered the sayinge whiche of you shall have an asse or an oxe fallen into a pitt and will not strayght waye pull him out on the Saboth daye?

6. And they coulde not answer him agayne to that.

7. He put forthe a similitude to ye gestes whe he marked how they preased to the hyest roumes and sayd vnto the:

8. When thou arte bidde to a weddynge of eny man syt not doune in ye hyest roume lest a more honorable man then thou be bidden of him

9. and he that bade bothe him and the come and saye to the: geve this man roume and thou then beginne with shame to take the lowest roume.

10. But rather when thou arte bidden goo and syt in the lowest roume that when he that bade the cometh he maye saye vnto the: frende syt vp hyer. Then shalt thou have worshippe in the presence of them that syt at meate with the.

11. For whosoever exalteth him sylfe shalbe brought lowe. And he yt hubleth him sylfe shalbe exalted

12. Then sayde he also to him that had desyred him to diner: When thou makest a diner or a supper: call not thy frendes nor thy brethre nether thy kinsmen nor yet ryche neghbours: lest they bidde the agayne and a recompence be made the.

13. But when thou makest afeast call the poore the maymed the lame and the blynde

14. and thou shalt be happy for they cannot recompence the. But thou shalt be recompensed at the resurreccion of the iuste men.

15. When one of them that sate at meate also hearde that he sayde vnto him: happy is he that eateth breed in the kyngdome of God.

16. Then sayd he to him. A certayne man ordened a greate supper and bade many

17. and sent his servaunt at supper tyme to saye to them that wer bidden come: for all thinges are now redy.

18. And they all atonce begane to make excuse. The fyrst sayd vnto him: I have bought a ferme and I must nedes goo and se it I praye the have me excused.

19. And another sayd: I hove bought fyve yooke of oxen and I goo to prove them I praye the have me excused.

20. The thyrde sayd: I have maried a wyfe and therfore I cannot come.

21. And the servaunt went and brought his master worde therof. Then was the good man of the housse displeased and sayd to his servaut: Goo out quickly into ye stretes and quarters of the cite and bringe in hidder the poore and the maymed and the halt and the blynde.

22. And the servaut sayd: lorde it is done as thou comaundedst and yet ther is roume.

23. And the lorde sayd to the servaunt: Go out into ye hye wayes and hedges and compell the to come in that my housse maye be filled.

24. For I saye vnto you that none of those men which were bidde shall tast of my supper.

25. Ther went agreate copany with him and he turned and sayde vnto them:

26. If a man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wyfe and chyldren and brethren and sisters more over and his awne lyfe he cannot be my disciple.

27. And whosoever beare not his crosse and come after me cannot be my disciple.

28. Which of you disposed to bilde a toure sytteth not doune before and counteth ye cost whether he have sufficient to performe it?

29. lest after he hath layde ye foundacion and is not able to performe it all yt beholde it beginne to mocke him

30. sayinge: this man beganne to bilde and was not able to make an ende.

31. Or what kynge goeth to make batayle agaynst another kinge and sitteth not doune fyrst and casteth in his mynde whether he be able wt ten thousande to mete him that cometh agaynst him wt .xx thousand.

32. Or els whyll ye other is yet a greate waye of he will sende embasseatours and desyre peace.

33. So lykewyse none of you yt forsaketh not all yt he hath can be my disciple.

34. Salt is good but yf salt have loste hyr saltnes what shall be seasoned ther with?

35. It is nether good for ye londe nor yet for ye donge hill but men cast it out at ye dores. He yt hath eares to heare let him heare.

## Luke 15

1. Then resorted vnto him all ye publicas and synners for to heare him.

2. And the pharises and scribes murmured sayinge: He receaved to his copany synners and eateth with them.

3. Then put he forthe this similitude to the sayinge:

4. What man of you havynge an hundred shepe yf he loose one of thee doth not leve nynty and nyne in the wyldernes and goo after yt which is loost vntyll he fynde him?

5. And whe he hath founde him he putteth him on his shulders with ioye:

6. And assone as he cometh home he calleth to gedder his lovers and neghbours sayinge vnto them: reioyse with me for I have founde my shepe which was loost.

7. I say vnto you yt lyke wyse ioye shalbe in heven over one synner yt repenteth moore then over nynety and nyne iuste persons whiche nede noo repentauce.

8. Ether what woman havynge .x. grotes yf she loose one doth not lyght a candell and swepe ye housse and seke diligently tyll she fynde it?

9. And when she hath founde it she calleth her lovers and her neghbours sayinge: Reioyce wt me for I have founde the groate which I had loost.

10. Lykwyse I saye vnto you ioye is made in ye presence of ye angels of god over one synner yt repenteth.

11. And he sayde: a certayne man had two sonnes

12. and the yonger of them sayde to his father: father geve me my parte of the goodes yt to me belongeth. And he devided vnto them his substaunce.

13. And not longe after ye yonger sonne gaddered all that he had to gedder and toke his iorney into a farre countre and theare he wasted his goodes with royetous lyvinge.

14. And when he had spent all that he had ther rose a greate derth thorow out all yt same londe and he began to lacke.

15. And he went and clave to a citesyn of yt same countre which sent him to his felde to kepe his swyne.

16. And he wold fayne have filled his bely with the coddes that ye swyne ate: and noo man gave him.

17. Then he came to him selfe and sayde: how many hyred servauntes at my fathers have breed ynough and I dye for honger.

18. I will aryse and goo to my father and will saye vnto him: father I have synned agaynst heven and before ye

19. and am no moare worthy to be called thy sonne make me as one of thy hyred servauntes.

20. And he arose and went to his father. And when he was yet a greate waye of his father sawe him and had compassion and ran and fell on his necke and kyssed him.

21. And the sonne sayd vnto him: father I have synned agaynst heven and in thy sight and am no moare worthy to be called thy sonne.

22. But his father sayde to his servautes: bringe forth that best garment and put it on him and put a rynge on his honde and showes on his fete.

23. And bringe hidder that fatted caulfe and kyll him and let vs eate and be mery:

24. for this my sonne was deed and is alyve agayne he was loste and is now founde. And they began to be merye.

25. The elder brother was in the felde and when he cam and drewe nye to ye housse he herde minstrelcy and daunsynge

26. and called one of his servauntes and axed what thoose thinges meate.

27. And he sayd vnto him: thy brother is come and thy father had kylled ye fatted caulfe because he hath receaved him safe and sounde.

28. And he was angry and wolde not goo in. Then came his father out and entreated him.

29. He answered and sayde to his father: Loo these many yeares have I done the service nether brake at eny tyme thy commaundment and yet gavest thou me never soo moche as a kyd to make mery wt my lovers:

30. but assone as this thy sonne was come which hath devoured thy goodes with harlootes thou haste for his pleasure kylled ye fatted caulfe.

31. And he sayd vnto him: Sonne thou wast ever with me and all that I have is thyne:

32. it was mete that we shuld make mery and be glad: for this thy brother was deed and is a lyve agayne: and was loste and is founde.

## Luke 16

1. And he sayd also vnto his disciples. Ther was a certayne rych man which had a stewarde that was acused vnto him that he had wasted his goodes.

2. And he called him and sayd vnto him: How is it that I heare this of the? Geve a comptes of thy steward shippe: For thou mayste be no longer stewarde.

3. The stewarde sayd wt in him selfe: what shall I do? for my master will take awaye fro me ye stewarde shippe. I canot digge and to begge I am ashamed.

4. I woote what to do yt when I am put out of ye stewardshippe they maye receave me into their houses.

5. Then called he all his masters detters and sayd vnto ye fyrst: how moche owest thou vnto my master?

6. And he sayd: an hondred tonnes of oyle. And he sayd to him: take thy bill and syt doune quickly and wryte fiftie.

7. Then sayd he to another: what owest thou? And he sayde: an hondred quarters of wheate. He sayd to him: Take thy bill and write foure scoore.

8. And the lorde comended the vniust stewarde because he had done wysly. For ye chyldren of this worlde are in their kynde wyser then ye chyldren of lyght.

9. And I saye also vnto you: make you frendes of the wicked mammon that when ye shall departe they may receave you into everlastinge habitacions.

10. He that is faithfull in that which is leste ye same is faithfull in moche. And he yt is vnfaithfull in ye least: is vnfaithfull also in moche.

11. So then yf ye have not ben faithfull in ye wicked mamon? who will beleve you in that which is true?

12. And yf ye have not bene faithfull in another manes busines: who shall geve you youre awne?

13. No servaunt can serve .ii. masters for other he shall hate ye one and love ye other or els he shall lene to the one and despyse the other. Ye can not serve God and mammon.

14. All these thinges herde the pharises also which were coveteous and they mocked him.

15. And he sayd vnto the: Ye are they which iustifie youre selves before me: but God knoweth youre hertes. For ye which is highlie estemed amoge me is abhominable in yt sight of god

16. The lawe and the Prophetes raygned vntyll the tyme of Iohn: and sence that tyme the kyngdom of God is preached and every man stryveth to goo in.

17. Soner shall heven and erth perisshe then one tytle of the lawe shall perisshe.

18. Whosoever forsaketh his wyfe and marieth another breaketh matrimony. And every man which marieth her that is devorsed from her husbande committeth advoutry also.

19. Ther was a certayne ryche man which was clothed in purple and fyne bysse and fared deliciously every daye.

20. And ther was a certayne begger named Lazarus whiche laye at his gate full of soores

21. desyringe to be refresshed with the cromes whiche fell from the ryche manes borde. Neverthelesse the dogges came and licked his soores.

22. And yt fortuned that the begger dyed and was caried by the angelles into Abrahas bosome. The riche man also died and was buried.

23. And beinge in hell in tormetes he lyfte vp his eyes and sawe Abraham a farre of and Lazarus in his bosome

24. and he cryed and sayd: father Abraham have mercy on me and sende Lazarus that he maye dippe the tippe of his fynger in water and cole my tonge: for I am tourmented in this flame.

25. But Abraha sayd vnto him Sonne remembre that thou in thy lyfe tyme receavedst thy pleasure and contrary wyse Lazarus payne. Now therfore is he comforted and thou art punysshed.

26. Beyonde all this bitwene you and vs ther is a greate space set so that they which wolde goo from thence to you cannot: nether maye come from thence to vs.

27. Then he sayd: I praye the therfore father send him to my fathers housse.

28. For I have fyve brethren: for to warne the left they also come into this place of tourmet.

29. Abraha sayd vnto him: they have Moses and the Prophetes let them heare them.

30. And he sayd: naye father Abraham but yf one came vnto the from the ded they wolde repent.

31. He sayd vnto him: If they heare not Moses and ye prophetes nether will they beleve though one roose from deeth agayne.

## Luke 17

1.  Then sayde he to ye disciples it can not be avoyded but that offences will come. Neverthelesse wo be to him thorow whom they come.

2. It were better for him that a mylstone were hanged aboute his necke and that he were cast into ye see then that he shuld offende one of this lytleons.

3. Take hede to youre selves. If thy brother trespas agaynst the rebuke him:

4. and yf he repent forgeve him. And though he sinne agest ye .vii. tymes in a daye and seve tymes in a daye tourne agayne to ye sayinge: it repenteth me forgeve him

5. And the apostles sayde vnto the Lorde: increase oure faith.

6. And the Lorde sayde: yf ye had faith lyke a grayne of mustard sede and shuld saye vnto this sycamine tree plucke thy selfe vp by the rootes and plant thy selfe in the see: he should obey you.

7. Who is it of you yf he had a servaute plowinge or fedinge catell that wolde saye vnto him when he were come from the felde Goo quickly and syt doune to meate:

8. and wolde not rather saye to him dresse wherwith I maye sup and gyrde vp thy selfe and serve me tyll I have eaten and dronken: and afterwarde eate thou and drinke thou?

9. Doeth he thanke that servaunt because he dyd that which was commaunded vnto him? I trowe not.

10. Soo lyke wyse ye when ye have done all thoose thinges which are commaunded you: saye we are vnprofitable servautes. We have done: ye which was oure duetye to do.

11. And it chaunsed as he went to Ierusalem that he passed thorow Samaria and Galile.

12. And as he entred into a certayne toune ther met him ten men yt were lepers. Which stode a farre of

13. and put forth their voyces and sayde: Iesu master have mercy on vs.

14. When he sawe the he sayde vnto them: Goo and shewe youre selves to the prestes. And it chaunsed as they went they were clensed.

15. And one of them when he sawe that he was clensed turned backe agayne and with a loude voyce praysed God

16. and fell doune on his face at his fete and gave him thankes. And the same was a Samaritane.

17. And Iesus answered and sayde: are ther not ten clensed? But where are those nyne?

18. Ther are not founde that returned agane to geve God prayse save only this straunger.

19. And he sayde vnto him: aryse and goo thy waye thy faith hath made the whoale.

20. When he was demaunded of ye pharises when the kyngdome of God shuld come: he answered them and sayde: The kyngdome of God cometh not with waytinge for.

21. Nether shall men saye: Loo here loo there. For beholde the kyngdome of God is with in you.

22. And he sayde vnto the disciples: The dayes will come when ye shall desyre to se one daye of the sonne of man and ye shall not se it.

23. And they shall saye to you: Se here Se there. Goo not after them nor folowe them

24. for as the lyghtenynge that apereth out of the one parte of the heven and shyneth vnto the other parte of heven: Soo shall the sonne of man be in his dayes.

25. But fyrst must he suffre many thinges and be refused of this nacion.

26. As it happened in ye tyme of Noe: So shall it be in the tyme of the sonne of man.

27. They ate they dranke they maryed wyves and were maryed even vnto yt same daye yt Noe went into ye arke: and ye floud cam and destroyed the all.

28. Lykewyse also as it chaunsed in the dayes of Lot. They ate they dranke they bought they solde they planted they bilte.

29. And even the same daye that Lot went out of Zodom it rayned fyre and brymstone from heven and destroyed them all.

30. After these ensamples shall it be in the daye when the sonne of man shall appere.

31. At that daye he that is on the housse toppe and his stuffe in the housse: let him not come doune to take it out. And lykewyse let not him that is in the feldes turne backe agayne to that he lefte behynde.

32. Remember Lottes wyfe.

33. Whosoever will goo about to save his lyfe shall loose it: And whosoever shall loose his lyfe shall save it.

34. I tell you: In that nyght ther shalbe two in one beed the one shalbe receaved and the other shalbe forsaken.

35. Two shalbe also a grindynge to gedder: the one shalbe receaved and the other forsaken.

36. And they answered and sayde to him: wheare Lorde? And he sayd vnto the: whersoever ye body shalbe thyther will the egles resoorte.

## Luke 18

1. And he put forth a similitude vnto the signifyinge that men ought alwayes to praye and not to be wery

2. sayinge: Ther was a Iudge in a certayne cite which feared not god nether regarded man.

3. And ther was a certayne wedowe in the same cite which came vnto him sayinge: avenge me of myne adversary.

4. And he wolde not for a whyle. But afterwarde he sayd vnto him selfe: though I feare not God nor care for man

5. yet because this wedowe troubleth me I will avenge her lest at the laste she come and hagge on me.

6. And the lorde sayd: heare what the vnrightewes Iudge sayeth.

7. And shall not god avenge his electe which crye daye and nyght vnto him ye though he differre them?

8. I tell you he will avenge them and that quickly. Neverthelesse when the sonne of man cometh suppose ye that he shall fynde faithe on the erthe.

9. And he put forthe this similitude vnto certayne which trusted in the selves yt they were perfecte and despysed other.

10. Two men went vp into ye teple to praye: ye one a pharise and the other a publican.

11. The pharise stode and prayed thus wt him selfe. God I thanke the yt I am not as other men are extorsioners vniuste advoutrers or as this publican.

12. I fast twyse in ye weke. I geve tythe of all that I possesse.

13. And the publican stode afarre of and wolde not lyfte vp his eyes to heven but smote his brest sayinge: God be mercyfull to me a synner.

14. I tell you: this ma departed hoe to his housse iustified moore then the other. For every man that exalteth him selfe shalbe brought low: And he yt hubleth him selfe shalbe exalted

15. They brought vnto him also babes yt he shuld touche the. When his disciples sawe that they rebuked the.

16. But Iesus called the vnto him and sayde: Suffre chyldren to come vnto me and forbidde the not. For of soche is ye kyngdome of God.

17. Verely I saye vnto you: whosoever receaveth not the kyngdome of God as a chylde: he shall not enter therin.

18. And a certayne ruler axed him sayinge: Good Master: what ought I to do to obtayne eternall lyfe?

19. Iesus sayd vnto him: Why callest thou me good? No man is good save God only.

20. Thou knowest ye comaundmentes: Thou shalt not commit advoutry: thou shalt not kyll: thou shalt not steale: thou shalt not beare false witnes: Honoure thy father and thy mother.

21. And he sayde: all these have I kept from my youthe.

22. When Iesus hearde that he sayde vnto him: Yet lackest thou one thinge. Sell all that thou hast and distribute it vnto the poore and thou shalt have treasure in heven and come and folowe me.

23. When he heard that he was hevy: for he was very ryche.

24. When Iesus sawe him morne he sayde: with what difficulte shall they that have ryches enter into the kyngdome of God:

25. it is easyer for a camell to goo thorow a nedles eye then for a ryche man to enter into the kyngdome of God.

26. Then sayde they that hearde that: And who shall then be saved?

27. And he sayde: Thinges which are vnpossible with men are possible with God.

28. Then Peter sayde: Loo we have lefte all and have folowed the.

29. And he sayde vnto them: Verely I saye vnto you ther is noo man that leaveth housse other father and mother other brethren or wyfe or chyldren for the kyngdome of Goddes sake

30. which same shall not receave moche moore in this worlde: and in the worlde to come lyfe everlastinge.

31. He toke vnto him twelve and sayde vnto them. Beholde we go vp to Ierusalem and all shalbe fulfilled that are written by ye Prophetes of the sonne of man.

32. He shalbe delivered vnto the gentils and shalbe mocked and shalbe despytfully entreated and shalbe spetted on:

33. and when they have scourged him they will put him to deeth and the thyrde daye he shall aryse agayne.

34. But they vnderstode none of these thinges. And this sayinge was hid fro them. And they perceaved not the thinges which were spoken.

35. And it came to passe as he was come nye vnto Hierico a certayne blynde man sate by the waye syde begginge.

36. And when he hearde the people passe by he axed what it meant.

37. And they sayde vnto him yt Iesus of Nazareth passed by.

38. And he cryed sayinge: Iesus ye sonne of David have thou mercy on me.

39. And they which went before rebuked him that he shuld holde his peace. But he cryed so moche the moare thou sonne of David have mercy on me.

40. And Iesus stode styll and commaunded him to be brought vnto him. And when he was come neare he axed him

41. sayinge: What wilt thou that I do vnto the? And he sayde: Lorde yt I maye receave my sight.

42. Iesus sayde vnto him: receave thy sight: thy faith hath saved the.

43. And immediatly he sawe and folowed him praysinge God. And all the people when they sawe it gave laude to God.

## Luke 19

1. And he entred in and went thorow Hierico.

2. And beholde ther was a ma named Zacheus which was a ruler amoge the Publicans and was riche also.

3. And he made meanes to se Iesus what he shuld be: and coulde not for the preace because he was of a lowe stature.

4. Wherfore he ran before and asceded vp into a wilde fygge tree to se him: for he shulde come that same waye.

5. And when Iesus cam to the place he loked vp and sawe him and sayd vnto him: zache attonce come doune for to daye I must abyde at thy housse.

6. And he came doune hastelye and receaved him ioyfully.

7. And when they sawe that they all groudged sayinge: He is gone in to tary with a man that is a synner.

8. And zache stode forth and sayd vnto ye Lorde: beholde Lorde ye haulfe of my gooddes I geve to the povre and if I have done eny ma wroge I will restore him fower folde.

9. And Iesus sayd to him: this daye is healthe come vnto this housse for as moche as it also is become the chylde of Abraha.

10. For the sonne of ma is come to seke and to save that which was looste.

11. As they hearde these thinges he added ther to a similitude be cause he was nye to Hierusalem and because also they thought that the kyngdome of God shuld shortely appere.

12. He sayde therfore: a certayne noble man wet into a farre countre to receave him a kyngdome and then to come agayne.

13. And he called his ten servauntes and delyvered them ten pounde sayinge vnto them: by and sell till I come.

14. But his citesens hated him and sent messengers after him sayinge: We will not have this man to raygne over vs.

15. And it came to passe when he was come agayne and had receaved his kyngdome he comaunded these servautes to be called to him (to whom he gave his money) to witt what every man had done.

16. Then came ye fyrst sayinge: Lorde thy pounde hath encreased ten poude.

17. And he sayde vnto him: Well good servaute because thou wast faithfull in a very lytell thynge take thou auctorite over ten cities.

18. And the other came sayinge: Lorde thy poude hath encreased fyve pounde.

19. And to ye same he sayde: and be thou also ruler ouer fyve cities.

20. And the thyrde came and sayde: Lorde beholde here thy pounde which I have kepte in a napkyn

21. for I feared the because thou arte a strayte man: thou takest vp that thou laydest not doune and repest that thou dyddest not sowe.

22. And he sayde vnto him: Of thine awne mouth iudge I the thou evyll servaunt. knewest thou that I am a strayte man takinge vp that I layde not doune and repinge that I dyd not sowe?

23. Wherfore then gavest not thou my money into the banke that at my cominge I might have required myne awne with vauntage?

24. And he sayde to them that stode by: take fro him that pounde and geve it him that hath ten poude.

25. And they sayd vnto him: Lorde he hath ten pounde.

26. I saye vnto you that vnto all the that have it shalbe geve: and from him yt hath not eve that he hath shalbe taken from him.

27. Moreover those myne enemys which wolde not that I shuld raigne over them bringe hidder and slee them before me.

28. And when he had thus spoken he proceded forthe before a ssendinge vp to Ierusalem.

29. And it fortuned when he was come nye to Bethphage and Bethany besydes moute olivete he sent two of his disciples

30. sayinge: Goo ye in to the toune which is over agaynste you. In the which assone as ye are come ye shall finde a colte tyed wheron yet never man sate. Lowse him and bringe him hider.

31. And if eny man axe you why that ye loowse him: thus saye vnto him ye lorde hath nede of him.

32. They that were sent went their waye and founde eve as he had sayde vnto the.

33. And as they were aloosinge ye coolte the owners sayde vnto the: why lowse ye ye coolte?

34. And they sayde: for ye Lorde hath nede of him.

35. And they brought him to Iesus. And they cast their raymet on ye colte and set Iesus thero.

36. And as he wet they spredde their clothes in ye waye.

37. And when he was now come wheare he shuld goo doune fro the moute olivete ye whole multitude of ye disciples began to reioyce and to lawde God with a loude voyce for all ye miracles yt they had sene

38. sayinge: Blessed be the kynge that cometh in the name of the Lorde: peace in heave and glory in the hyest.

39. And some of ye Pharises of the copany sayde vnto him: Master rebuke thy disciples.

40. He answered and sayde vnto the: I tell you yf these shuld holde their peace the stones wold crye.

41. And when he was come neare he behelde the citie and wept on it

42. sayinge: Yf thou haddest dest knowen those thinges which belonge vn thy peace eve at this thy tyme. But now are they hydde from thyne eyes.

43. For the dayes shall come vpo the that thy enemys shall cast a banke aboute the and copasse the rounde and kepe the in on every syde

44. and make the even with the grounde with thy chyldren which are in the. And they shall not leve in the one stone vpo another because thou knewest not the tyme of thy visitacion.

45. And he went in to the temple and begane to cast out them that solde therin and them that bought

46. sayinge vnto them yt is written: my housse is the housse of prayer: but ye have made it a den of theves.

47. And he taught dayly in the temple. The hye Prestes and the Scribes and the chefe of the people went about to destroye him:

48. but coulde not finde what to do. For all the people stacke by him and gave him audience.

## Luke 20

1. And yt fortuned in one of those dayes as he taught the people in the temple and preached the gospell: the hye prestes and the scribes came with the elders

2. and spake vnto him sayinge. Tell vs by what auctorite thou doest these thinges? Ether who is he yt gave ye this auctorite?

3. He answered and saide vnto the: I also will axe you a questio and answer me.

4. The baptyme of Iohn: was it from heaven or of men?

5. And they thought with in them selves sayinge: yf we shall saye from heave: he will saye: why then beleved ye him not?

6. But and yf we shall saye of men all ye people will stone vs. For they be persuaded that Ihon is a Prophet.

7. And they answered that they coulde not tell whence it was.

8. And Iesus sayde vnto them: nether tell I you by what auctorite I do these thinges.

9. Then begane he to put forthe to the people this similitude. A certayne man planted a vyneyarde and let it forthe to fermers and went him selfe into a straunge countre for a greate season.

10. And when the tyme was come he sent a servaut to his tennauntes that they shuld geve him of the frutes of the vyneyarde. And the tennauntes dyd bet him and sent him awaye empty.

11. And agayne he sent yet another servaunt. And they dyd bet him and foule entreated him also and sent him awaye emptye.

12. Moreover he sent the thyrde to and him they wouded and cast out.

13. Then sayde the lorde of the vyneyarde: what shall I do? I will sende my deare sonne him peradventure they will reverence when they se him.

14. But when the fermers sawe him they thought in them selves sayinge: this is the heyre come let vs kyll him that the inheritaunce maye be oures.

15. And they cast him out of the vyneyarde and kylled him. Now what shall the Lorde of the vyneyarde do vnto them?

16. He will come and destroye those fermers and will let out his vyneyarde to other. When they hearde that they sayde: God forbyd.

17. And he behelde them and sayde: what meaneth this then yt is wrytten: The stone that the bylders refused the same is made ye heed corner stone?

18. whosoever stomble at that stone shalbe broken: but on whosoever it faul vpon it wyll grynde him to powder.

19. And the hye Prestes and the Scribes the same howre went about to laye hondes on him but they feared the people. For they perceaved that he had spoken this similitude agaynst them.

20. And they watched him and sent forth spies which shuld fayne them selves perfecte to take him in his wordes and to delyvre him vnto the power and auctorite of the debite.

21. And they axed him sayinge: Master we knowe that thou sayest and teachest ryght nother cosiderest thou eny manes degre but teachest the waye of God truly.

22. Ys it laufull for vs to geve Cesar tribute or no?

23. He perceaved their craftynes and sayde vnto them: why tept ye me?

24. Shewe me a peny. Whose ymage and superscripcio hath it? They answered and sayde: Cesars.

25. And he sayde vnto them: Geve then vnto Cesar that which belongeth vnto Cesar: and to God that which pertayneth to God.

26. And they coulde not reprove his sayinge before the people. But they marvayled at his answer and helde their peace.

27. Then came to him certayne of the Saduces which denye that ther is eny resurreccio. And they axed him

28. sayinge: Master Moses wrote vnto vs if eny mannes brother dye havinge a wyfe and the same dye with out yssue: that then his brother shuld take his wyfe and reyse vp seede vnto his brother.

29. Ther were seven brethren and the fyrste toke a wyfe and dyed with out children.

30. And the seconde toke the wyfe and he dyed chyldlesse.

31. And the thyrde toke her and in lyke wyse the resydue of the seven and leeft no chyldren be hynde them and dyed.

32. Last of all the woma dyed also.

33. Now at the resurreccio whose wyfe of them shall she be? For seven had her to wyfe.

34. Iesus answered and sayde vnto them. The chyldre of this worlde mary wyves and are maryed

35. but they which shalbe made worthy to enioye that worlde and the resurreccion from deeth nether mary wyves nether are maryed

36. nor yet can dye eny moare. For they are equall vnto the angels: and are the sonnes of God in as moche as they are the chyldre of the resurreccion.

37. And that the deed shall ryse agayne even Moses signified besydes the busshe when he sayde: the Lorde God of Adraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Iacob.

38. For he is not the God of the deed but of them which live. For all live in him.

39. Then certayne of the Pharises answered and sayde: Master thou hast well sayde.

40. And after that durst they not axe him eny question at all.

41.  Then sayde he vnto them: how saye they that Christ is Davids sonne?

42. And David him selfe sayth in the boke of the Psalmes: The Lorde sayde vnto my Lorde syt on my right honde

43. tyll I make thine enemys thy fothe stole.

44. Seinge David calleth him Lorde: How is he then his sonne.

45. Then in the audience of all the people he sayde vnto his disciples

46. beware of the Scribes which desyre to goo in longe clothinge: and love gretynges in the markets and the hyest seates in the synagoges and chefe roumes at feastes

47. which devoure widdowes houses and that vnder a coloure of longe prayinge: the same shall receave greater damnacion.

## Luke 21

1. As he behelde he sawe the ryche men how they cast in their offeringes into the treasury.

2. And he sawe also a certayne povre widdowe which cast in thyther two mites.

3. And he sayde: of a trueth I saye vnto you this poore wyddowe hath put in moare then they all.

4. For they all have of their superfluyte added vnto the offerynge of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the substaunce that she had.

5. As some spake of the teple how it was garnesshed with goodly stones and iewels he sayde.

6. The dayes will come whe of these thynges which ye se shall not be lefte stone apon stone that shall not be throwen doune.

7. And they axed him sayinge: Master whe shall these thinges be and what signe will therbe whe suche thinges shall come to passe.

8. And he sayd: take hede that ye be not deceaved. For many will come in my name saying: I am he: and the tyme draweth neare. Folowe ye not them therfore.

9. But when ye heare of warre and of dissencion: be not afrayd. For these thinges must fyrst come: but the ende foloweth not by and by.

10. Then sayd he vnto the: Nacion shall ryse agaynst nacion and kingdom agaynst kyngdome

11. and greate erthquakes shall be in all quarters and honger and pestilence: and fearfull thinges. And greate signes shall therbe from heven.

12. But before all these they shall laye their hondes on you and persecute you delyueringe you vp to the sinagoges and into preson and bringe you before kynges and rulers for my names sake.

13. And this shall chaunce you for a testimoniall.

14. Let it sticke therfore faste in youre hertes not once to stody before what ye shall answere:

15. for I will geve you a mouth and wisdome where agaynste all youre adversarys shall not be able to speake nor resist.

16. Ye and ye shalbe betrayed of youre fathers and mothers and of youre brethren and kynsmen and lovers aud some of you shall they put to deeth.

17. And hated shall ye be of all men for my names sake.

18. Yet ther shall not one heer of youre heedes perisshe.

19. With youre pacience possesse youre soules.

20.  And when ye se Ierusalem beseged with an hoste then vnderstonde that the desolacio of the same is nye.

21. Then let them which are in Iewrye flye to the mountaynes. And let them which are in the middes of it departe oute. And let not them that are in other countreis enter ther in.

22. For these be the dayes of vengeance to fulfill all that are writte.

23. But wo be to them that be with chylde and to them that geve sucke in those dayes: for ther shalbe greate trouble in the londe and wrath over all this people.

24. And they shall fall on the edge of the swearde and shalbe leed captive into all nacions. And Ierusalem shalbe trooden vnder fote of the gentyls vntyll the tyme of the gentyls be fulfilled.

25.  And ther shalbe signes in the sunne ad in the mone and in the starres: and in ye erth the people shalbe in soche perplexite yt they shall not tell which waye to turne them selves. The see and the waters shall roore

26. and menes hertes shall fayle them for feare and for lokinge after thoose thinges which shall come on the erth. For the powers of heve shall move.

27. And then shall they se the sonne of ma come in a clowde with power and greate glory.

28. When these thinges begyn to come to passe: then loke vp and lifte vp youre heddes for youre redemcion draweth neye.

29. And he shewed the a similitude: beholde ye fygge tree and all other trees

30. when they shute forth their buddes ye se and knowe of youre awne selves that sommer is then nye at hod.

31. So lyke wyse ye (when ye se these thinges come to passe) vnderstonde that the kyngdome of God is neye.

32. Verely I saye vnto you: this generacion shall not passe tyll all be fulfilled.

33. Heaven and erth shall passe: but my wordes shall not passe.

34.  Take hede to youre selves lest youre hertes be overcome with surfettinge and dronkennes and cares of this worlde: and that that daye come on you vnwares.

35. For as a snare shall it come on all them that sit on the face of the erthe.

36. Watche therfore continually and praye that ye maye obtayne grace to flye all this that shall come and that ye maye stonde before the sonne of man.

37. In the daye tyme he taught in the temple and at night he went out and had abydinge in the mount olivete.

38. And all the people came in the morninge to him in the temple for to heare him.

## Luke 22

1. The feaste of swete breed drue nye whiche is called ester

2. and the hye prestes and Scribes sought how to kyll him but they feared the people.

3. Then entred Satan into Iudas whose syr name was Iscariot (which was of the nombre of the twelve)

4. and he went his waye and comuned with the hye Prestes and officers how he might betraye him to them.

5. And they were glad: and promysed to geve him money.

6. And he consented and sought oportunite to betraye him vnto them when the people were awaye.

7. Then came ye daye of swete breed when of necessite the esterlambe must be offered.

8. And he sent Peter and Iohn sayinge: Goo and prepare vs the ester lambe that we maye eate.

9. They sayde to him. Where wilt thou yt we prepare?

10. And he sayd vnto them. Beholde when ye be entred into the cite ther shall a man mete you bearinge a pitcher of water him folowe into the same housse yt he entreth in

11. and saye vnto ye good ma of ye housse. The master sayeth vnto ye: where is ye gest chamber where I shall eate myne ester lambe wt my disciples?

12. And he shall shew you a greate parloure paved. Ther make redy.

13. And they wet and foude as he had sayd vnto the: and made redy ye ester lambe.

14.  And when the houre was come he sate doune and the twelve Apostles with him.

15. And he sayde vnto them: I have inwardly desyred to eate this ester lambe with you before yt I suffre.

16. For I saye vnto you: hence forthe I will not eate of it eny moore vntill it be fulfilled in the kingdome of God.

17. And he toke the cup and gave thankes and sayde. Take this and devyde it amonge you.

18. For I saye vnto you: I will not drinke of the frute of the vyne vntill the kingdome of God be come.

19. And he toke breed gave thankes and gave to them sayinge: This is my body which is geven for you. This do in the remembraunce of me.

20. Lykewyse also when they had supped he toke the cup sayinge: This cup is the newe testament in my bloud which shall for you be shedde.

21. Yet beholde the honde of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.

22. And ye sonne of man goeth as it is appoynted: But wo be to yt man by whom he is betrayed.

23. And they began to enquyre amoge them selves which of them it shuld be that shuld do that.

24.  And ther was a stryfe amoge the which of them shuld be taken for the greatest.

25. And he sayde vnto them: the kynges of the getyls raygne over them and they that beare rule over them are called gracious lordes.

26. But ye shall not be so. But he that is greatest amonge you shalbe as the yongest: and he that is chefe shalbe as the minister.

27. For whether is greater he that sitteth at meate: or he that serveth? Is not he that sitteth at meate? And I am amoge you as he that ministreth.

28. Ye are they which have bidden with me in my temptacions.

29. And I apoynt vnto you a kyngdome as my father hath appoynted to me:

30. that ye maye eate and drynke at my table in my kyngdome and sit on seates and iudge the twelve tribes of Israell.

31. And the Lorde sayde: Simon Simon beholde Satan hath desired you to sifte you as it were wheate:

32. bnt I have prayed for the that thy faith fayle not. And when thou arte converted strengthe thy brethre.

33. And he sayd vnto him. Lorde I am redy to go with the in to preson and to deth.

34. And he sayde: I tell the Peter the cocke shall not crowe this daye tyll thou have thryse denyed yt thou knewest me.

35.  And he sayde vnto them: when I sent you with out wallet and scripe and shoes? lacked ye eny thinge? And they sayd no.

36. And he sayde to them: but nowe he that hath a wallet let him take it vp and lykewyse his scrippe. And he that hath no swearde let him sell his coote and bye one.

37. For I saye vnto you that yet that which is written must be performed in me: even with the wycked was he nombred. For those thinges which are written of me have an ende.

38. And they sayde: Lorde beholde here are two sweardes. And he sayde vnto them: it is ynough.

39. And he came out and went as he was wote to mounte olivete. And the disciples folowed him.

40. And when he came to the place he sayde to the: praye lest ye fall into temptacio.

41. And he gate him selfe from them about a stones cast and kneled doune and prayed

42. sayinge: Father yf thou wilt withdrawe this cup fro me. Neverthelesse not my will but thyne be be fulfilled.

43. And ther appered an angell vnto him from heaven confortinge him.

44. And he was in an agonye and prayed somwhat longer. And hys sweate was lyke droppes of bloud tricklynge doune to the grounde.

45. And he rose vp from prayer and came to his disciples and foude them slepinge for sorowe

46. and sayde vnto them: Why slepe ye? Ryse and praye lest ye fall into temptacion.

47. Whill he yet spake: beholde ther came a company and he that was called Iudas one of the twelve wet before them and preased nye vnto Iesus to kysse him.

48. And Iesus sayd vnto him: Iudas betrayest thou ye sonne of man with a kysse?

49. When they which were about him sawe what wolde folow they sayde vnto him. Lorde shall we smite with swearde.

50. And one of them smote a servaut of ye hiest preste of all and smote of his right eare.

51. And Iesus answered and sayd: Soffre ye thus farre forthe. And he touched his eare and healed him.

52. Then Iesus sayde vnto the hye prestes and rulers of the temple and the elders which were come to him. Be ye come out as vnto a thefe with sweardes and staves?

53. When I was dayly with you in the teple ye stretched not forth hondes agaynst me. But this is even youre very houre and the power of darcknes.

54. Then toke they him and ledde him and brought him to the hye prestes housse. And peter folowed a farre of.

55. When they had kyndled a fyre in the middes of the palys and were set doune to geder Peter also sate doune amonge them.

56. And wone of the wenches behelde him as he sate by the fyer and set good eyesight on him and sayde: this same was also with him.

57. Then he denyed hym sayinge: woman I knowe him not

58. And after a lytell whyle another sawe him and sayde: thou arte also of them. And Peter sayd man I am not.

59. And aboute the space of an houre after another affirmed sayinge: verely even this felowe was with hym for he is of Galile

60. and Peter sayde: ma I woote not what thou sayest. And immediatly whyll he yet spake the cocke crewe.

61. And the Lorde tourned backe and loked apon Peter. And Peter remembred the wordes of the Lorde how he sayde vnto him before ye cocke crowe thou shalt denye me thryse.

62. And Peter went out and wepte bitterly.

63. And the men that stode about Iesus mocked him and smoote him

64. and blyndfolded him and smoote his face. And axed him sayinge: arede who it is that smoote ye?

65. And many other thinges despytfullye sayd they agaynst him.

66. And assone as it was daye the elders of the people and the hye prestes and scribes came to gedder and ledde him into their counsell sayinge:

67. arte thou very Christ? tell vs. And he sayde vnto the: yf I shall tell you ye will not beleve

68. And yf also I axe you ye will not answere me or let me goo.

69. Herafter shall the sonne of man sit on the ryght honde of the power of God.

70. Then sayde they all: Arte thou then the sonne of God? He sayd to them: ye saye yt I am.

71. Then sayde they: what nede we eny further witnes? We oure selves have herde of his awne mouthe.

## Luke 23

1. And the whole multitude of them arose and ledde him vnto Pylate.

2. And they beganne to accuse him sayinge: We have founde this felowe pervertynge the people and forbiddynge to paye tribute to Cesar: sayinge that he is Christ a kynge.

3. And Pylate apposed him sayinge: arte thou the kynge of the iewes? He answered him and sayde: thou sayest it.

4. Then sayde Pylate to the hye prestes and to the people: I fynde noo faute in this man.

5. And they were the moore fearce sayinge. He moveth the people teachynge thorowout all Iewry and beganne at Galile even to this place.

6. When Pilate hearde mencion of Galile he axed whether the ma were of Galile.

7. And assone as he knewe that he was of Herodes iurisdiccion he sent him to Herode which was also at Ierusalem in those dayes.

8. And when Herode sawe Iesus he was excedinglie gladde. For he was desyrous to se him of a longe season because he had hearde many thinges of him and trusted to have sene some myracle done by him.

9. Then questeoned he with him of many thinges. But he answered him not one worde.

10. The hye prestes and scribes stode forthe and accused him straytly.

11. And Herod wt his men of warre despysed him and mocked him and arayed him in whyte and sent him agayne to Pylate.

12. And the same daye Pylate and Herod were made frendes togeder. For before they were at variaunce.

13. And Pylate called to geder the hye prestes and the rulers and the people

14. and sayde vnto them: Ye have brought this man vnto me as one that perverted the people. And beholde I have examined him before you and have founde no faute in this man of those thinges where of ye accuse him.

15. No nor yet Herode. For I sent you to him: and lo no thinge worthy of deeth is done to him.

16. I will therfore chasten him and let him lowsse.

17. For of necessite he must have let one lowse vnto them at that feast.

18. And all the people cryed at once sayinge: awaye with him and delyvre to vs Barrabas:

19. which for insurrccion made in the cite and morther was cast into preson.

20. Pylate spake agayne to them willynge to let Iesus lowse.

21. And they cryed sayinge: Crucify him Crucify him

22. He sayde vnto them the thyrde tyme. What evyll hath he done? I fynde no cause of deeth in him. I will therfore chasten him and let him lowse.

23. And they cryed with loude voyce and required that he myght be crucifyed. And the voyce of them and of the hye Prestes prevayled.

24. And Pylate gave sentence that it shuld be as they required

25. and let lowse vnto them him that for insurreccion and morther was cast into preson whom they desyred: and delyvered Iesus to do with him what they wolde.

26. And as they ledde him awaye they caught one Symon of Syrene commynge out of the felde: and on him layde they the crosse to beare it after Iesus.

27. And ther folowed him a greate company of people and of wemen which weme bewayled and lamented him.

28. But Iesus turned backe vnto them and sayde: Doughters of Ierusalem wepe not for me: but wepe for youre selves and for youre chyldren.

29. For beholde the dayes will come when men shall saye: happy are the baren and the wombes that never bare and the pappes which never gave sucke.

30. Then shall they beginne to saye to the mountaynes fall on vs: and to the hilles cover vs.

31. For yf they do this to a grene tree what shalbe done to the drye?

32. And ther were two evyll doers ledde with him to be slayne.

33. And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary there they crucified him and the evyll doers one on ryght honde and the other on the lefte.

34. Then sayde Iesus: father forgeve them for they woot not what they do. And they parted his rayment and cast loottes.

35. And the people stode and behelde. And the rulers mocked him with thee saying: he holpe other men let him helpe him selfe yf he be Christ the chosen of god.

36. The soudiers also mocked him and came and gave him veneger

37. and sayde: yf thou be that kynge of ye Iewes save thy silfe.

38. And his superscripcio was writte over him in greke in latine and Ebreu: This is the kynge of the Iewes.

39. And one of the evyll doers which hanged rayled on him sayinge: If thou be Christ save thy selfe and vs.

40. The other answered and rebuked him sayinge. Net herfearest thou god because thou arte in the same damnacion?

41. We are ryghteously punesshed for we receave accordynge to oure dedes: But this man hath done nothinge amysse.

42. And he sayde vnto Iesus: Lorde remember me when thou comest into thy kyngdome.

43. And Iesus sayde vnto him: Verely I saye vnto the to daye shalt thou be with me in Paradyse.

44. And it was about the sixt houre. And ther came a darcknes over all the londe vntyll ye nynth houre

45. and the sonne was darckened. And the vayle of the temple dyd rent even thorow the myddes.

46. And Iesus cryed with a greate voyce and sayd: Father into thy hondes I comende my sprete. And when he thus had sayd he gave vp the goost.

47. When ye Centurion sawe what had happened he glorified God sayinge: Of a surtie this man was perfecte.

48. And all the people that came to geder to that sight beholdynge the thinges which were done: smoote their bestes and returned home.

49. And all his acquayntaunce and the wemen that folowed him from Galile stode a farre of beholdynge these thinges.

50. And beholde ther was a man named Ioseph a councelloure and was a good man and a iuste

51. and dyd not consent to the counsell and dede of them which was of Aramathia a cite of the Iewes: which same also wayted for ye kyngdome of God:

52. he went vnto Pilate and begged the boddy of Iesus

53. and toke it doune and wrapped it in a lynnen clooth and layed it in an hewen toumbe wherin was never man before layed.

54. And that daye was ye Saboth even and the Saboth drue on.

55. The wemen that folowed after which came with him from Galile behelde the sepulcre and how his body was layed.

56. And they returned and prepared odoures and oyntmetes: but rested the Saboth daye accordynge to the commaundement.

## Luke 24

1. On the morowe after the saboth erly in the morninge they came vnto the toumbe and brought the odoures which they had prepared and other wemen with them

2. And they founde the stone rouled awaye fro the sepulcre

3. and went in: but founde not the body of the Lorde Iesu.

4. And it happened as they were amased therat: Beholde two men stode by them in shynynge vestures.

5. And as they were a frayde and bowed doune their faces to the erth: they sayd to them: why seke ye the lyvinge amonge the deed?

6. He is not here: but is rysen. Remember how he spake vnto you when he was yet with you in Galile

7. sayinge: that the sonne of man must be delyvered into the hondes of synfull men and be crucified and the thyrde daye ryse agayne.

8. And they remembred his wordes

9. and returned from the sepulcre and tolde all these thinges vnto the eleven and to all the remanaunt.

10. It was Mary Magdalen and Ioanna and Mary Iacobi and other that were with the which tolde these thinges vnto the Apostles

11. and their wordes semed vnto them fayned thinges nether beleved they them.

12. Then aroose Peter and ran vnto the sepulcre and stouped in and sawe the lynnen cloothes layde by them selfe and departed wondrynge in him selfe at that which had happened.

13. And beholde two of them went that same daye to a toune which was fro Ierusalem about thre scoore for longes called Emaus:

14. and they talked togeder of all these thinges that had happened.

15. And it chaunsed as they comened togeder and reasoned that Iesus him selfe drue neare and went with them.

16. But their eyes were holden that they coulde not knowe him.

17. And he sayde vnto them: What maner of comunicacions are these that ye have one to another as ye walke and are sadde.

18. And the one of them named Cleophas answered and sayd vnto him: arte thou only a straunger in Ierusalem and haste not knowen the thinges which have chaunsed therin in these dayes?

19. To whom he sayd: what thinges? And they sayd vnto him: of Iesus of Nazareth which was a Prophet myghtie in dede and worde before god and all the people.

20. And how the hye prestes and oure rulers delyvered him to be condempned to deeth: and have crucified him.

21. But we trusted that it shuld have bene he that shuld have delyvered Israel. And as touchynge all these thinges to daye is even the thyrd daye that they were done.

22. Ye and certayne wemen also of oure company made vs astonyed which came erly vnto the sepulcre

23. and founde not his boddy: and came sayinge that they had sene a vision of angels which sayde that he was alyve.

24. And certayne of them which were with vs went their waye to the sepulcre and founde it even so as the wemen had sayde: but him they sawe not.

25. And he sayde vnto the: O foles and slowe of herte to beleve all yt the prophetes have spoken.

26. Ought not Christ to have suffred these thinges and to enter into his glory?

27. And he began at Moses and at all the prophetes and interpreted vnto them in all scriptures which were wrytten of him.

28. And they drue neye vnto the toune wich they went to. And he made as though he wolde have gone further.

29. But they constrayned him sayinge: abyde with vs for it draweth towardes nyght and the daye is farre passed. And he went in to tary with the.

30. And it came to passe as he sate at meate wt them he toke breed blessed it brake and gave to them.

31. And their eyes were openned and they knewe him: and he vnnisshed out of their syght.

32. And they sayde betwene them selves: dyd not oure hertes burne with in vs whyll he talked with vs by the waye and as he opened to vs the scriptures?

33. And they roose vp the same houre and returned agayne to Ierusalem and founde the eleven gadered to geder and them that were with them which

34. sayde: the Lorde is rysen in dede and hath apered to Simon.

35. And they tolde what thinges was done in the waye and how they knewe him in breakynge of breed.

36. As they thus spake Iesus him selfe stode in ye myddes of them and sayde vnto them: peace be with you.

37. And they were abasshed and afrayde supposinge yt they had sene a sprete

38. And he sayde vnto the: Why are ye troubled and why do thoughtes aryse in youre hertes?

39. Beholde my hondes and my fete that it is even my selfe. Handle me and se: for spretes have not flesshe and bones as ye se me have.

40. And when he had thus spoken he shewed them his hondes and his fete.

41. And whyll they yet beleved not for ioye and wondred he sayde vnto the: Have ye here eny meate?

42. And they gave him a pece of a broyled fisshe and of an hony combe.

43. And he toke it and ate it before them.

44. And he sayde vnto the. These are the wordes which I spake vnto you whyll I was yet with you: that all must be fulfilled which were written of me in the lawe of Moses and in the Prophetes and in the Psalmes.

45. Then openned he their wyttes that they myght vnderstond the scriptures

46. and sayde vnto them. Thus is it written and thus it behoved Christ to suffre and to ryse agayne from deeth the thyrde daye

47. and that repentaunce and remission of synnes shuld be preached in his name amonge all nacions and must beginne at Ierusalem.

48. And ye are witnesses of these thinges.

49. And beholde I will sende the promes of my father apon you. But tary ye in ye cite of Ierusalem vntyll ye be endewed with power from an hye.

50. And he ledde the out into Bethany and lyfte vp his hondes and blest them.

51. And it cam to passe as he blessed the he departed from the and was caryed vp in to heven.

52. And they worshipped him and returned to Ierusalem with greate ioye

53. and were continually in the temple praysinge and laudinge God. Amen.
