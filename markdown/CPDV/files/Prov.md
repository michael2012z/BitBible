# Proverbs

## Proverbs 1

1. The use and end of the proverbs. An exhortation to flee the company of the wicked: and to hearken to the voice of wisdom.  The parables of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel,

2. in order to know wisdom and discipline,

3. to understand words of prudence, and to accept the instruction of doctrine, justice and judgment, and equity,

4. so as to give discernment to little ones, knowledge and understanding to adolescents.

5. By listening, the wise shall become wiser and the intelligent shall possess governments.1:5The word ‘gubernacula’ could also more generally refer to ‘positions of leadership.’ Note how sapiens and intelligens are used as nouns, but audiens is used as a participle; this is discerned from the context.(Conte)

6. He shall turn his soul to a parable and to its interpretation, to the words of the wise and their enigmas.

7. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. The foolish despise wisdom as well as doctrine.1:7The word ‘foolish’ is a better translation than ‘fools’ because ‘foolish’ describes a person by their behavior, which may change.(Conte)

8. Listen, my son, to the discipline of your father, and forsake not the law of your mother,

9. so that grace may be added to your head and a collar to your neck.1:9A ‘torques’ can refer to a necklace of twisted metal, but it can also refer to non-metal adornment around the neck. In this translation, using a Christological and specifically Roman Catholic meaning, the text is taken as referring to the collar of a priest.(Conte)

10. My son, if sinners should entice you, do not consent to them.

11. If they should say: “Come with us. We will lie in wait for blood. We will lay traps against the innocent, without cause.

12. Let us swallow him alive, like Hell, and whole, like one descending into the pit.

13. We will discover every precious substance. We will fill our houses with spoils.

14. Cast your lot with us. One purse will be for us all.”

15. My son, do not walk with them. Preclude your feet from their paths.1:15Why are these parables addressed to ‘my son,’ i.e. to a man, or to men in general? First, it is Solomon speaking to David, which in essence is itself a parable of a wise father speaking to his son. Second, in a special way, God is using this book to speak to priests. Third, it foreshadows the wisdom of the Son of God, Jesus Christ. Fourth, we are all (men, women, and children) called to be like the Son of God. And there may be other reasons.(Conte)

16. For their feet rush to evil, and they hurry to shed blood.

17. But a net is thrown in vain before the eyes of those who have wings.

18. Likewise, they lie in ambush against their own blood, and they undertake deceits against their own souls.

19. Thus, the ways of all those who are greedy seize the souls of those who possess.

20. Wisdom forewarns far and wide; she bestows her voice in the streets.

21. She cries out at the head of crowds; at the entrance of the gates of the city, she offers her words, saying:

22. “Little ones, how long will you choose to be childish, and how long will the foolish desire what is harmful to themselves, and how long will the imprudent hate knowledge?

23. Be converted by my correction. Lo, I will offer my spirit to you, and I will reveal my words to you.

24. For I called, and you refused. I extended my hand, and there was no one who watched.

25. You have despised all my counsels, and you have neglected my rebukes.

26. Similarly, I will ridicule you at your demise, and I will mock you, when that which you feared shall overcome you.

27. When sudden calamity rushes upon you, and your demise advances like a tempest, when tribulation and anguish overcome you,

28. then they will call to me, and I will not heed, they will arise in the morning, and not find me.

29. For they held hatred for discipline, and they would not accept the fear of the Lord;

30. they would not consent to my counsel, but they detracted from all of my corrections.

31. Therefore, they shall eat the fruit of their way, and they shall have their fill of their own counsels.

32. The loathing of the little ones shall destroy them, and the prosperity of the foolish shall perish them.

33. But whoever will listen to me shall rest without terror, and shall have full enjoyment of abundance, without fear of evils.”  

## Proverbs 2

1. The advantages of wisdom: and the evils from which it delivers.  My son, if you would accept my words, and conceal my commandments within you,

2. so that your ears may listen to wisdom, then bend your heart in order to know prudence.

3. For if you would call upon wisdom and bend your heart to prudence,

4. if you will seek her like money, and dig for her as if for treasure,

5. then you will understand the fear of the Lord, and you will discover the knowledge of God.

6. For the Lord bestows wisdom, and out of his mouth, prudence and knowledge.

7. He will preserve the salvation of the righteous, and he will protect those who walk in simplicity:

8. serving the paths of justice, and guarding the ways of sanctity.

9. Then you shall understand justice and judgment, and equity, and every good path.

10. If wisdom is to enter into your heart, and if knowledge is to become pleasing to your soul,

11. then counsel must guard you, and prudence must serve you,

12. so that you may be rescued from the evil way, and from the man who speaks perversities,

13. from those who leave the straight path to walk in dark ways,

14. who rejoice when they have done evil, and who exult in the most wicked things.

15. Their ways are perverse, and their steps are infamous.

16. So may you be rescued from the foreign woman, and from the outsider, who softens her speech,2:16The word ‘extranea’ is feminine here, but in English the feminine is discerned from the subsequent use of ‘her’.(Conte)

17. and who leaves behind the Guide of her youth,

18. and who has forgotten the covenant of her God. For her household inclines toward death, and her paths toward Hell.

19. All those who enter to her will not return again, nor will they take hold of the paths of life.

20. So may you walk in the good way, and keep to the difficult paths of the just.2:20The word ‘calles’ is difficult to render in English in just one word. It refers to a less traveled, uneven or difficult path, such as a mountain path, or a rocky or narrow path.(Conte)

21. For those who are upright shall live upon the earth, and the simple shall continue upon it.

22. Yet truly, the impious shall perish from the earth, and those who act unjustly shall be taken away from it. 

## Proverbs 3

1. An exhortation to the practice of virtue.  My son, do not forget my law, but let your heart guard my precepts.

2. For they shall set before you length of days, and years of life, and peace.

3. Let not mercy and truth abandon you: encircle them around your throat, and inscribe them on the tablets of your heart.

4. And so shall you discover grace and good discipline, in the sight of God and men.

5. Have confidence in the Lord with all your heart, and do not depend upon your own prudence.

6. In all your ways, consider him, and he himself will direct your steps.

7. Do not seem wise to yourself. Fear God, and withdraw from evil.

8. Certainly, it shall be health to your navel, and refreshment to your bones.

9. Honor the Lord with your substance, and give to him from the first of all your fruits,

10. and then your storehouses will be filled with abundance, and your presses shall overflow with wine.

11. My son, do not discard the discipline of the Lord, and do not fall away when you are corrected by him.

12. For whomever the Lord loves, he corrects, and just as a father does with a son, he wins him over.

13. Blessed is the man who finds wisdom and who advances to prudence.

14. Her acquisition is better than trading in silver, and her fruit is better than the first and purest gold.

15. She is more precious than all riches, and all that can be desired cannot prevail in comparison to her.

16. Length of days is at her right hand, and at her left hand is wealth and glory.

17. Her ways are beautiful ways, and all her paths are peaceful.

18. She is a tree of life to those who overtake her, and he who shall take hold of her is blessed.

19. The Lord founded the earth on wisdom. He secured the heavens with prudence.

20. By his wisdom, the abyss erupted and the clouds increased with dew.

21. My son, let not these things move away from your eyes. Preserve law as well as counsel.

22. And so shall there be life in your soul and grace in your voice.

23. Then you shall walk confidently in your way, and your feet will not stumble.

24. When you slumber, you shall not fear. When you rest, your sleep also will be sweet.

25. Do not fear unexpected terror, nor the power of the impious falling upon you.

26. For the Lord will be at your side, and he will guard your feet, so that you may not be seized.

27. Do not prevent him who is able from doing good. When you are able, do good yourself too.

28. Do not say to your friend: “Go away, and then return. Tomorrow I will give to you.” When you are able to do so, give in the present.

29. Do not undertake evil against your friend, even though he has trust in you.

30. Do not contend against a man without cause, even though he has done no evil to you.

31. Do not rival an unjust man, and do not imitate his ways.3:31Or, ‘Do not compete with an unjust man,’ or, ‘Do not rival an unjust man.’(Conte)

32. For everyone who ridicules is an abomination to the Lord, and his communication is for the simple.

33. Destitution in the house of the impious is from the Lord. But the habitations of the just shall be blessed.

34. He will ridicule those who ridicule, but he will bestow grace upon the mild.

35. The wise will possess glory. The exaltation of the foolish is disgraceful.  

## Proverbs 4

1. A further exhortation to seek after wisdom.  Listen, sons, to the discipline of a father, and pay attention, so that you may know prudence.

2. I will bestow upon you a good gift. Do not relinquish my law.

3. For I, too, was the son of my father, tender and an only son in the sight of my mother.

4. And he taught me, and he also said: “Let your heart accept my words. Keep my precepts, and you shall live.

5. Obtain wisdom, obtain prudence. May you neither forget, nor turn away from, the words of my mouth.

6. Do not send her away, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will preserve you.

7. The beginning of wisdom is to obtain wisdom, and, with all that you possess, to acquire prudence.

8. Grasp her, and she will exalt you. You will be glorified by her, when you have embraced her.

9. She will bestow upon your head an increase in graces, and she will protect you with a noble crown.

10. Listen, my son, and accept my words, so that years of life may be multiplied for you.

11. I will demonstrate to you the way of wisdom. I will lead you along the paths of equity.

12. When you have entered by these, your steps will not be constrained, and when running, you will have no obstacle.

13. Take hold of discipline. Do not dismiss it. Guard it, for it is your life.

14. Do not delight in the paths of the impious, nor permit the way of evil-doers to please you.

15. Take flight from it. Do not pass close to it. Turn away and abandon it.

16. For they do not sleep, unless they have done evil. And their sleep is quickly taken away from them, unless they have overthrown.

17. They eat the bread of impiety, and they drink the wine of iniquity.

18. But the path of the just is like a shining light: it advances and increases, even to the day of completion.

19. The way of the impious is darkened. They do not know where they may fall.

20. My son, pay attention to my sermons, and incline your ear to my eloquent words.

21. Let them not recede from your eyes. Keep them in the midst of your heart.

22. For they are life to those who find them and health to all that is flesh.

23. Preserve your heart with all watchfulness, for life proceeds from this.

24. Remove from yourself a corrupt mouth, and let detracting lips be far from you.

25. Let your eyes look straight ahead, and let your eyelids precede your steps.

26. Direct the path of your feet, and all your ways shall be secure.

27. Turn aside, neither to the right, nor to the left; yet turn your foot away from evil. For the Lord knows the ways that are on the right, and truly, those that are on the left are perverse. But he himself will make your courses straight. Then your journey will advance in peace.  

## Proverbs 5

1. An exhortation to fly unlawful lust, and the occasions of it.  My son, pay attention to my wisdom, and incline your ear to my prudence,

2. so that you may guard your thinking, and so that your lips may preserve discipline. Do not pay attention to the deceit of a woman.

3. For the lips of a loose woman are like a dripping honeycomb, and her voice is smoother than oil.5:3The word ‘meretricis’ can mean prostitute, but it can also, more often, refer to a woman who behaves like a prostitute: either a kept woman with only one lover, or a promiscuous woman with many lovers. The translation as ‘loose woman’ is a better fit for the meaning of the text. As is clear from the previous verse, this passage is not merely warning against prostitution, but against loose living.(Conte)

4. But in the end, she is as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp as a two-edged sword.

5. Her feet descend into death, and her steps reach even to Hell.

6. They do not walk along the path of life; her steps are wandering and untraceable.

7. Therefore, my son, listen to me now, and do not withdraw from the words of my mouth.

8. Make your way at a distance from her, and do not approach the doors of her house.

9. Do not give your honor to foreigners, and your years to the cruel.

10. Otherwise, outsiders may be filled with your strength, and your labors may be in a foreign house,

11. and you may mourn in the end, when you will have consumed your flesh and your body. And so you may say:

12. “Why have I detested discipline, and why has my heart not been quieted by correction?

13. And why have I not listened to the voice of those who guided me? And why has my ear not inclined to my teachers?

14. I have almost been with all evil in the midst of the church and of the assembly.”

15. Drink water from your own cistern and from the springs of your own well.

16. Let your fountains be diverted far and wide, and divide your waters in the streets.5:16This verse seems to contradict the previous and subsequent verses. The original Douay-Rheims version has a note that relates water to doctrine. My understanding of that note: distribute good doctrine far and wide among men of sincere intention, but not to those who make themselves to be foreigners to the truth.(Conte)5:16The previous verse (5:15) refers to drinking water from ones own well. This can refer to doctrine, as verses 12 to 14 indicate. This can also refer to chastity and marriage, as the subsequent verses indicate. However, verse 5:16 cannot be taken to refer to sexuality, but only to doctrine. It often happens, as Scripture weaves together comments on a variety of related subjects, that some verses are to be understood more narrowly, and others more broadly.(Conte)

17. Hold them for yourself alone, and do not let strangers be partakers with you.5:17When applied to doctrine, this verse and the previous one can be understood in a number of ways. Concerning doctrine, one can distribute it far and wide, sharing it in the streets. Or one can keep it to oneself, so that only you and God know your thoughts about the Faith. But in either case, one cannot ‘let strangers be partakers’ casting the pearls of true doctrine before those swine who ridicule and despise the truth.(Conte)5:17It is not so unusual to have two consecutive verses that seem to contradict one another. This technique of writing causes the reader to think about the correct meaning of each verse. This is also seen later in Proverbs when the topic is responding to the foolish according to their folly.(Conte)

18. Let your spring be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of your youth:5:18So then, rejoice in true doctrine with your beloved wife. Share the Faith with her. But also, this verse refers in a figurative manner to marital relations.(Conte)

19. a beloved doe and most pleasing fawn. Let her breasts inebriate you at all times. Be delighted continually by her love.

20. Why are you seduced, my son, by a strange woman, and why are you kept warm by the bosom of another?

21. The Lord beholds the ways of man, and he considers all his steps.

22. His own iniquities take hold of the impious, and he is bound by the cords of his own sins.

23. He shall die, for he has not held to discipline. And by the multitude of his foolishness, he shall be deceived.  

## Proverbs 6

1. Documents on several heads.  My son, if you have taken a pledge on behalf of your friend, then you have bound your hand to an outsider,

2. then you are ensnared by the words of your own mouth, and taken captive by your own words.

3. Therefore, my son, do what I say, and free yourself, for you have fallen into the hand of your neighbor. Run, hurry, awaken your friend.

4. Do not grant sleep to your eyes, nor let your eyelids slumber.

5. Rescue yourself like a gazelle from the hand, and like a bird from the hand of the fowler.

6. Go to the ant, you lazy one, and consider her ways, and so learn wisdom.

7. For though she has no ruler, nor instructor, nor leader,

8. she provides meals for herself in the summer, and she gathers at the harvest what she may eat.

9. How long will you slumber, you lazy one? When will you rise up from your sleep?

10. You will sleep a little, you will slumber a little, you will fold your hands a little to sleep,

11. and then destitution will meet with you, like a traveler, and poverty, like an armed man. Yet truly, if you would be diligent, then your harvest will arrive like a fountain, and destitution will flee far from you.

12. An apostate man, a harmful man, walks with a perverse mouth;6:12One meaning of this passage is to refer to the Antichrist. The word ‘inutilis’ can mean ‘useless,’ but in the context of apostasy and perverse words, it must have its alternate meaning, which is ‘harmful.’(Conte)

13. he winks with the eyes, touches with the foot, speaks with the finger.

14. With a depraved heart he devises evil, and at all times he sows conflict.

15. To this one, his perdition will arrive promptly, and he shall be crushed suddenly: he will no longer have any remedy.

16. Six things there are that the Lord hates, and the seventh, his soul detests:6:16Again, this refers, in one level of meaning to the Antichrist. He will have a reign of six years, plus part of a seventh year. The six things are the six full years of his reign, and the seventh is the most detestable time of his reign (when he attempts to make a false ascension to the heavens). The number 616 refers to the Antichrist’s name: six letters in his first name, six letters in this last name, with his middle initial in-between.(Conte)

17. haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,

18. a heart that devises the most wicked thoughts, feet running swiftly unto evil,

19. a deceitful witness bringing forth lies, and he who sows discord among brothers.6:19These three verses (6:17-19) are a description of the Antichrist: he tries to sow discord among the brethren of the Church; he bears false witness against the true Christ.(Conte)

20. My son, preserve the precepts of your father, and do not dismiss the law of your mother.

21. Bind them to your heart unceasingly, and encircle them around your throat.

22. When you walk, let them keep step with you. When you sleep, let them guard you. And when you keep watch, speak with them.

23. For commandment is a lamp, and law is a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life.

24. So may they guard you from an evil woman, and from the flattering tongue of the outsider.6:24The negative things that are said in the Book of Proverbs about an evil woman or a loose (or kept) woman, can also be applied to the false prophet, who is a associated with the Antichrist and who will be a female antipope.(Conte)

25. Let not your heart desire her beauty; do not be captivated by her winks.

26. For the price of a prostitute is only one loaf. Yet the woman seizes the precious soul of a man.6:26The loaf is the false Eucharist promoted by this female false prophet, especially when she becomes antipope. She tries to seize men’s souls with flattery. She is attractive looking, and claims to be chaste, but she a loose woman, worse than a prostitute.(Conte)

27. Would a man be able to conceal fire in his bosom, so that his garments would not burn?

28. Or could he walk over burning coals, so that his feet would not be burned?

29. So also, he who enters to the wife of his neighbor shall not be clean when he touches her.

30. Not so great is the fault when someone has stolen. For he steals so as to satisfy a hungry soul.6:30The fault is not so great, etc: The sin of theft is not so great, as to be compared with adultery: especially when a person pressed with hunger (which is the case here spoken of) steals to satisfy nature. Moreover the damage done by theft may much more easily be repaired, than the wrong done by adultery. But this does not hinder, but that theft also is a mortal sin, forbidden by one of the ten commandments.(Challoner)

31. Also, if he is apprehended, he shall repay sevenfold and hand over all the substance of his house.

32. But whoever is an adulterer, because of the emptiness of his heart, will destroy his own soul.

33. He gathers shame and dishonor to himself, and his disgrace will not be wiped away.

34. For the jealousy and fury of the husband will not spare him on the day of vindication,

35. nor will he agree to the pleadings of anyone, nor will he accept, as repayment, a multitude of gifts. 

## Proverbs 7

1. The love of wisdom is the best preservative from being led astray by temptation.  My son, guard my words and conceal my precepts within you.

2. Son, preserve my commandments, and you shall live. And keep my law as the pupil of your eye.

3. Bind it with your fingers; write it on the tablets of your heart.

4. Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” and call prudence your friend.

5. So may she guard you from the woman who is an outsider, and from the stranger who sweetens her words.

6. For I gaze from the window of my house, through the lattice,

7. and I see little ones. I consider a frenzied youth,

8. who crosses the street at the corner and close to the way of that house.

9. He steps into shadows, as day becomes evening, into the darkness and gloom of the night.

10. And behold, a woman meets him, dressed like a harlot, prepared to captivate souls: chattering and rambling,

11. unwilling to bear silence, unable to keep her feet at home,

12. now outside, now in the streets, now lying in ambush near the corners.

13. And overtaking the youth, she kisses him, and with a provocative face, she flatters him, saying:

14. “I vowed sacrifices for well-being. Today I have repaid my vows.

15. Because of this, I have gone out to meet you, desiring to see you, and I have found you.

16. I have woven my bed with cords. I have strewn it with embroidered tapestries from Egypt.

17. I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloe, and cinnamon.

18. Come, let us be inebriated in abundance, and let us delight in the embraces of desire, until the day begins to dawn.

19. For my husband is not in his house. He has gone away on a very long journey.

20. He took with him a bag of money. He will return to his house on the day of the full moon.”

21. She enmeshed him with many words, and she drew him forward with the flattery of her lips.

22. Immediately, he follows her, like an ox being led to the sacrifice, and like a lamb acting lasciviously, and not knowing that he is being drawn foolishly into chains,

23. until the arrow pierces his liver. It is just as if a bird were to hurry into the snare. And he does not know that his actions endanger his own soul.

24. Therefore, my son, hear me now, and attend to the words of my mouth.

25. Do not let your mind be pulled into her ways. And do not be deceived by her paths.

26. For she has tossed aside many wounded, and some of those who were very strong have been slain by her.

27. Her household is the way to Hell, reaching even to the inner places of death.  

## Proverbs 8

1. The preaching of wisdom. Her excellence.  Does not wisdom call out, and prudence bestow her voice?

2. At the summits and the tops of exalted places, standing above the ways, in the midst of the paths,

3. beside the gates of the city, at the very doors, she speaks, saying:

4. “O men, to you I call out, and my voice is to the sons of men.

5. O little ones, understand discernment. And you who are unwise, turn your souls.

6. Listen, for I will speak about great things, and my lips will be opened, so as to foretell what is right.

7. My throat shall practice truth, and my lips shall detest the impious.

8. All my words are just. There is no depravity in them, and no perversity.

9. They are upright to those who understand, and equitable to those who discover knowledge.

10. Accept my discipline, and not money. Choose the doctrine that is greater than gold.

11. For wisdom is better than all that is most precious, and everything that is desirable cannot compare to her.

12. I, wisdom, dwell in counsel, and I am inside learned thoughts.

13. The fear of the Lord hates evil. I detest arrogance, and pride, and every wicked way, and a mouth with a double tongue.

14. Counsel is mine, and equity. Prudence is mine. Strength is mine.

15. Through me, kings reign and legislators decree just conditions.

16. Through me, princes rule and the powerful decree justice.

17. I love those who love me. And those who stand watch for me until morning shall discover me.

18. With me, are wealth and glory, superb riches and justice.

19. For my fruit is better than gold and precious stones, and my progeny better than choice silver.

20. I walk in the way of justice, in the midst of the paths of judgment,

21. so that I may enrich those who love me, and thus complete their treasures.

22. The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways, before he made anything, from the beginning.

23. I was ordained from eternity, and out of antiquity, before the earth was formed.

24. The abyss did not yet exist, and I was already conceived; neither had the fountains of waters yet erupted.

25. The mountains, with their great mass, had not yet been established. Before the hills, I was brought forth.

26. Still he had not made the earth, and the rivers, and the poles of the globe of the earth.

27. I was already present: when he prepared the heavens; when, with a certain law and a circuit, he fortified the abyss;

28. when he made firm the sky above, and set free the fountains of waters;

29. when he encompassed the sea within its limits, and laid down a law for the waters, lest they transgress their limits; when he weighed the foundations of the earth.

30. I was with him in composing all things. And I was delighted, throughout every day, by playing in his sight at all times,

31. playing in globe of the earth. And my delight was to be with the sons of men.

32. Therefore, sons, hear me now. Blessed are those who preserve my ways.

33. Listen to discipline, and become wise, and do not be willing to cast it aside.

34. Blessed is the man who listens to me, and who stands watch at my gates every day, and who observes at the posts of my doors.

35. He who finds me, finds life, and he will draw salvation from the Lord.8:35Or health, or prosperity from the Lord.(Conte)

36. But he who sins against me will wound his own soul. All who hate me love death.”  

## Proverbs 9

1. Wisdom invites all to her feast. Folly calls another way.  Wisdom has built a house for herself. She has hewn seven columns.

2. She has immolated her victims. She has mixed her wine and set forth her table.9:2Wine was mixed with water for drinking in ancient times. This purified the water and prevented those who drank from becoming too inebriated. The mixing of wine with water also has symbolic meaning.(Conte)

3. She has sent her maids to call out to the tower and to the fortified walls of the city,

4. “If anyone is little, let him come to me.” And to the unwise, she has said:

5. “Approach. Eat my bread, and drink the wine that I have mixed for you.

6. Leave behind childishness. And live and walk by the ways of prudence.”

7. Whoever teaches a mocker causes injury to himself. And whoever argues with the impious produces a blemish on himself.

8. Do not be willing to argue with a mocker, lest he hate you. Dispute with the wise, and he will love you.

9. Present an opportunity to the wise, and wisdom shall be added to him. Teach the just, and he will hurry to receive it.

10. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of holiness is prudence.

11. For by me, your days will be multiplied and years of life will be added to you.

12. If you would be wise, you will be so for yourself. But if you would be one who ridicules, you alone shall carry the evil.

13. A foolish and loud woman, who is full of enticements and who knows nothing at all,

14. sat at the entrance of her house on a seat, in a high place of the city,

15. so as to call to those who were passing by the way and continuing on their journey:

16. “Whoever is little, let him turn aside to me.” And to the frenzied, she said,9:16Notice that the foolish woman imitates wisdom personified (both represented as feminine). They both call out to whoever is little, but the call from the foolish woman is false.(Conte)

17. “Stolen waters are more soothing, and secret bread is more pleasant.”

18. And he did not know that giants are there, and that her companions are in the depths of Hell.

The word ‘filios’ is masculine and refers to sons, but the word ‘nepotes’ is not masculine and refers to grandchildren. Since the word ‘vir’ is lacking and the word ‘nepotes’ is not specific to male descendents, the word filios is translated as children. An alternate translation is equally viable: ‘The good man leaves behind heirs: sons and grandsons.’(Conte)

16. The wise fear, and so turn away from evil. The foolish leap ahead with confidence.14:16Sometimes the word ‘et’ is used in a way in Latin in which the word ‘and’ is not used in English. So, it is translated as ‘with,’ or perhaps even replaced by punctuation, rather than words.(Conte)

There is the fruit of a man’s mouth and the ‘genimina’ (spouts, shoots, vegetables, crops, produce, etc.). The translation of harvest makes the verse more comprehensible in English than any of the more literal translation choices.(Conte)

13. My son, eat honey, because it is good, and the honeycomb, because it is so sweet to your throat.24:13The superlative does not always mean the one that is above all others.

8. Just like one who casts a stone into the pile of Mercury, so also is he who gives honor to the foolish.

9. In the manner of a thorn, if it were to spring up from the hand of a drunkard, so also is a parable in the mouth of the foolish.26:9If a drunkard had a thorn sticking out of his hand, he would repeatedly and inadvertently harm himself with it.(Conte)

16. The lazy one seems wiser to himself than seven men speaking judgments.

17. Just like one who takes hold of a dog by the ears, so also is he who crosses impatiently and meddles in the quarrels of another.

23. In the same manner as an earthen vessel, if it were adorned with impure silver, conceited lips are allied with a wicked heart.26:23Even though ‘pessimo’ is superlative, the translation does not need to use the grammatical superlative because ‘wicked’ includes a superlative meaning, i.e. most bad or very bad.(Conte)
