15. Woe to the dissolute in heart, who do not trust God! For, as a result, they will not be protected by him.2:15Both are viable translations: ‘who do not believe in God’ and ‘who do not believe God.’ Both meanings are correct.(Conte)

17. If he believes in her, he will inherit her, and whatever arises from him will be confirmed.

18. For she walks with him through temptation, and she chooses him from the beginning.4:18In temptation, etc: The meaning is, that before wisdom will choose any for her favourite, she will try them by leading them through contradictions, afflictions, and temptations, the usual noviceship of the children of God.(Challoner)

19. She will lead fear and dread and trials over him, and she will crucify him with the tribulation of her doctrine, until she has tested him in his thoughts and she can trust in his soul. 

20. And then she will strengthen him, and lead him along a straight path, and rejoice in him.

21. And she will disclose her secrets to him, and she will store up treasure, of the knowledge and understanding of justice, in him.

## Sirach 5

1. We must not presume of our wealth or strength: nor of the mercy of God, to go on in sin: we must be steadfast in virtue and truth.

3. And you should not say: “How powerful am I?” or, “Who will cast me down because of my deeds?” For God will vindicate with vengeance.

10. Do not choose to be anxious for unjust wealth. For these things will not benefit you in the day of darkness and retribution.

12. Be steadfast in the way of the Lord and in the truth of your understanding and knowledge, and let words of peace and justice overtake you.

13. Be meek when listening to a word, so that you may understand. And offer a true response in wisdom.

14. If you understand, then answer your neighbor. But if you do not, then let your hand be over your mouth, so that you are not caught by an inept word, and then confounded.

15. Honor and glory are in the words of those who understand, yet truly, the tongue of the imprudent man is his undoing.

16. You should not be called a whisperer, and you should not be caught by your own tongue, and then confounded.

17. For confusion and remorse is upon a thief, and a wicked mark is upon the double-tongued; but for the whisperer, there is hatred and animosity and disgrace.

18. Justify the small and the great similarly. 

## Sirach 6

2. You should not extol yourself, like a bull, in the thoughts of your soul, lest perhaps your strength may be cast down through foolishness,

3. which would consume your leaves, and destroy your fruit, and leave you behind like a dry tree in the desert.

4. For a wicked soul will destroy the one who has it. For it gladly provides enemies to him, and it will lead him to the fate of the impious. 

5. A sweet word multiplies friends and mitigates enemies. And thankful words abound in a good man.

6. Allow many to be at peace with you, but allow one out of a thousand to be your counselor.

7. If you would obtain a friend, test him before you accept him, and do not trust him readily.

8. For there is a friend according to his own time, but he will not remain in the day of tribulation.

9. And there is a friend who can be turned to animosity. And there is a friend who will reveal hatred and ridicule and insults.

10. And there is a friend who is a companion at table, but he will not remain in a day of need.

11. A friend, if he remains steadfast, will be to you as you are to yourself, and he will act with faithfulness among those of your household.

12. If he humbles himself before you and hides himself from your face, you shall have a noble and harmonious friendship.

13. Distance yourself from your enemies, and pay attention to your friends.

14. A faithful friend is a strong shelter, and whoever has found one has found a treasure.

15. Nothing is comparable to a faithful friend, and no weight of silver or gold is worth more than the goodness of his fidelity.

16. A faithful friend is a medicine for life and immortality; and those who fear the Lord will find one.

17. He who fears God will have a similar good friendship, because his friend will be like him. 

18. Son, from your youth receive instruction, and then you will find wisdom, even to your grey hairs.

29. For, in the very end, you will find rest in her, and she will turn into your delight.

30. Then her fetters will be a strong protection and a firm foundation for you, and her chains will be a robe of glory.

31. For in her is the beauty of life, and her bindings are a healing bandage.

32. You will be clothed with her as with a robe of glory, and you will set her upon your head like a crown of rejoicing.

33. Son, if you heed me, you will learn. And if you adapt your mind, you will be wise.

34. If you incline your ear, you will receive doctrine. And if you love to listen, you will be wise.

35. Stand among the multitude of prudent elders, and join yourself to their wisdom from the heart, so that you may be able to hear every discourse about God, and so that the proverbs of praise may not flee from you.

36. And if you see a man of understanding, stand watch for him, and let your feet wear down the steps of his doors.

37. Set your thoughts on the precepts of God, and be entirely constant in his commandments. And he himself will give a heart to you, and the desire of wisdom will be given to you.

4. You should not be continually in need of entertainment, nor should you be persuaded by it, lest perhaps you may perish by its effectiveness.9:4This is not an condemnation of dancing or singing, but of the excessive use of entertainment in any form, lest perhaps the entertainment may have an excessive influence over you.

And weep over the foolish, for his understanding has failed.22:10For the fool: In the language of the Holy Ghost, he is styled a fool, that turns away from God to follow vanity and sin. And what is said by the wise man against fools is meant of such fools as these.(Challoner)

21. Just as chaff in a high place, or a wall made of mortar without stones set within, will not continue against the face of the wind,22:21The word ‘pali’ refers to chaff, not to a pole or a fence; for some reason the Latin puts the word in the second declension (masculine), rather than in the first declension (feminine). The phrase ‘cæmenta sine impensa posita’ refers to a wall, which would usually be made of stones and mortar, but which is made ‘sine impensa posita’ without (sine) heavy or weighed things (impensa), i.e. stones, set within it (posita).(Conte)

23. Despite a cowardly heart, the thoughts of the foolish will not fear any situation; yet neither will one who continues always in the precepts of God.22:23The foolish man does not think that his nervous heart will dread any situation; he reaches this incorrect conclusion because of his foolishness. But those who keep the precepts of God truly do not need to dread any situation.(Conte)

29. In the time of his tribulation, remain faithful to him, so that you may also be an heir with him in his inheritance.

30. Just as the steam from an oven, or the smoke from a fire, rises up before a flame, so also do curses and insults and threats rise up before bloodshed.

## Sirach 23

1. A prayer for grace to flee sin: cautions against profane swearing and other vices.  Lord, Father and Ruler of my life: may you not abandon me to their counsel, nor permit me to fall by them.23:1By them: Viz., the tongue and the lips, mentioned in the last verse of the foregoing chapter.(Challoner)

2. They would impose scourges over my thoughts and over the discipline of wisdom in my heart. And they would not spare me from their ignorances, nor would they allow their own offenses to become apparent.23:2That they spare me not in their ignorances, etc: That is, that the scourges and discipline of wisdom may restrain the ignorances, that is, the slips and offences which are usually committed by the tongue and the lips.(Challoner)

3. And they intend that my ignorances would increase, and my offenses be multiplied, and my sins abound. And so I would fall in the sight of my adversaries, and be rejoiced over by my enemy.

9. Do not allow your mouth to become accustomed to swearing oaths. For in this, there are many pitfalls.

10. Truly, do not allow the naming of God to be continually in your mouth, and do not treat as if common the names of the holy ones. For you will not escape punishment by them.

11. Just as a servant, continually interrogated, will not be without a bruise, so everyone who swears oaths and takes God’s name will not be entirely free from sin.

12. A man who swears many oaths will be filled with iniquity, and scourges will not depart from his house.

13. And if he fails to fulfill it, his offense will be over him, and if he pretends he fulfilled it, he offends doubly.

14. And if he swears an oath insincerely, he will not be justified. For his house will be filled with retribution for him.

21. Two kinds of persons abound in sins, and a third adds wrath and perdition. 

22. A desirous soul is like a burning fire, it will not be quenched, until it devours something.

23. And a man who is wicked in the desires of his flesh will not desist until he has kindled a fire.

24. To a man of fornication, all bread is sweet; he will not tire of transgression, to the very end.

25. Every man who transgresses his own bed has contempt for his own soul. And so he says: “Who can see me?

26. Darkness surrounds me, and the walls enclose me, and no one catches sight of me. Whom should I fear? The Most High will not remember my offenses.”

27. And he does not understand that God’s eye sees all things. For fear within a man such as this drives away from him both the fear of God and the eyes of those men who fear God.

28. And he does not acknowledge that the eyes of the Lord are much brighter than the sun, keeping watch over all the ways of men, even to the depths of the abyss, and gazing into the hearts of men, even to the most hidden parts.

29. For all things, before they were created, were known to the Lord God. And even after their completion, he beholds all things.

30. This man will be punished in the streets of the city, and he will be chased like a young horse. And in a place that he does not suspect, he will be captured.

31. And because he did not understand the fear of the Lord, he will be in disgrace before all men,

32. as will be every woman, too, who abandons her husband and establishes an inheritance by marriage to another man.

35. Her children will not take root, and her branches will not produce fruit.

37. And those who are left behind will acknowledge that there is nothing better than the fear of God, and that there is nothing sweeter than to have respect for the commandments of the Lord.

38. It is a great glory to follow the Lord. For length of days will be received from him.  

## Sirach 24

1. Wisdom praises herself: her origin, her dwelling, her dignity, and her fruits.  Wisdom will praise her own mind, and she will be honored by God, and she will be glorified in the midst of her people.

2. And she will open her mouth in the churches of the Most High, and she will be glorified in the sight of his virtue.

3. And in the midst of her own people, she will be exalted. And she will be admired by the holy assembly.

4. And she will have praise within the multitude of the elect. And she will be blessed among the blessed. And she will say:

5. “I went forth from the mouth of the Most High, as the first-born before all creatures.

6. I caused an unfailing light to arise in the heavens. And I covered all the earth like a cloud.

7. I lived in the highest places, and my throne is in the pillar of a cloud.

8. I alone have encompassed the circuit of heaven, and have penetrated to the depths of the abyss, and have walked upon the waves of the sea,

9. and have stood upon the whole earth. And among every people,

10. and in every nation, I have held primacy.

11. And by virtue, I have tread upon the hearts of all, the great and the lowly. And I have sought my rest in all of them. And I will continue, as the inheritance of the Lord.

12. Then the Creator of all things instructed and spoke with me. And the One who created me rested in my tabernacle. 

13. And he said to me: ‘Let your dwelling place be with Jacob, and let your inheritance be in Israel, for you shall take root among my elect.’

14. From the beginning, and before the world, I was created. And even unto the future world, I will not cease to exist. For I have ministered before him in the holy habitation.

15. And in this way, I was established in Zion. And likewise, in the holy city, I found rest. And my authority was in Jerusalem.

16. And I took root among an honorable people, within the portion of my God, within his inheritance. And so my abode is in the full assembly of the saints.

20. I gave off an aromatic fragrance like cinnamon or balsam. I produced a sweet odor like the best myrrh.

21. And I perfumed my dwelling place with sweet gum, and aromatic resin, and flower petals, and aloe, as well as the finest cedar from Lebanon. And my fragrance is like undiluted balsam.24:21The word ‘ungula’ literally means claw or talon, but is also used in botany to refer to the claw-shaped base of certain flower petals. Galbanum is a type of aromatic resin. Sweet gum is the closest translation which preserves the figurative meaning of the text and also is easily understandable in English. Challoner translates ‘gutta’ (lit. a droplet) as aloe. The phrase ‘Libanus non incisus’ refers to cedar wood from Lebanon (see previous verse). The phrase ‘non incisus’ means uncut, but certainly it is not an uncut tree; rather, it is an expression referring to the excellence of the cedar wood.(Conte) 

22. I have extended my branches like a terebinth tree, and my branches are of honor and grace.

23. Like the vine, I have born the fruit of a sweet fragrance. And my flowers are the fruit of honor and integrity.

24. I am the mother of the beauty of love, and of fear, and of knowledge, and of holy hope.

25. All grace of the way and of the truth is in me. All hope of life and of virtue is in me.

26. Journey toward me, all you who desire me, and be filled by my harvest.

27. For my spirit is sweeter than honey, and my inheritance is better than honey and the honeycomb.

26. And be cautious concerning your own sons. And be attentive to those of your own household.

27. In all of your works, trust your soul to faith. For this is the keeping of the commandments.32:27In faith: That is, follow sincerely thy soul in her faith and conscience.(Challoner)

28. Whoever believes God attends to the commandments. And whoever trusts in him will not be diminished. 

## Sirach 33

1. The fear of God is the best security. Times and men are in the hands of God. Take care of yourself as long as you live, and look after your servants.  No evils will befall one who fears the Lord. Instead, God will preserve him during temptation and will free him from evils.

2. A wise man does not hate the commandments and the justices, and so he will not be thrown about violently, like a ship in a storm.

3. A man of understanding puts his faith in the law of God, and so the law is faithful to him.

11. With a multitude of disciplines, the Lord has distinguished them and diversified their ways.

12. Some of them, he has blessed and exalted. And some of them he has sanctified and placed close to himself. And some of them, he has cursed and brought low, and he has turned them from their station.

13. Just as the clay is in the potter’s hand, so as to form and to shape it,

14. so are all his ways in accord with his dispensation, and so is man in the hand of the One who made him. And he will repay him according to his judgment.

15. Good is against evil, and life is against death; so also is a sinner against a just man. And so should you consider all the works of the Most High: two and two, and one against another.

19. Listen to me, you great ones, with all the peoples. And incline your ears, you rulers of the Church.

20. You should not give authority over yourself to a son or wife, to a brother or friend, in your life.

21. While you are still living and breathing, let no one among all flesh change you.33:21Change you: That is, so as to have this power over you.(Challoner)

23. In all your works, be pre-eminent.33:23The pre-eminence: That is, be master in thy own house, and part not with thy authority.(Challoner)

24. You should not allow a blemish upon your glory. On the day of the consummation of the days of your life, at the time of your passing, distribute your inheritance. 

25. Fodder and a rod and a burden are for a donkey; bread and discipline and work are for a servant.

26. He works under discipline, and he seeks rest. Allow his hands to be idle, and he seeks liberty.

27. The yoke and the strap bend a stiff neck, and continual labors bend a servant.

32. If you harm him unjustly, he will turn away and flee.

33. And then, when he lifts himself up and departs, you will not know whom to ask, or in what way to seek him. 

## Sirach 34

1. The vanity of dreams. The advantage of experience, and of the fear of God.  The hopes of a senseless man are empty and false; and dreams extol the imprudent.

3. In the vision of dreams, one thing represents another, as when a mask is before the face of a man.

4. What can be cleansed by the unclean? And what truth can be spoken from a lie?

5. Erroneous divinations and false signs and the dreams of evildoers are emptiness.

9. He who has not been tested, what does he know? A man with much experience will consider many things. And whoever has learned much will explain with understanding.

10. He who has no experience knows little. And he who has done many things has made many mistakes.34:10In the context of a passage extolling the benefits of experience, the word ‘malitiam’ refers to faults, not to wickedness. Experience brings wisdom, but who can be free from fault who has much experience?(Conte)

11. He who has not been tested, what kind of things can he know? He who has been deceived will be more cunning.

12. I have seen much by wandering, and the customs of many things.

13. At times, I have even been in danger of death because of these things, but I was freed by the grace of God.

14. The spirit of those who fear God is sought, and they will be blessed by his providence.

21. An immolation from iniquity is a stained oblation, and the derisions of the unjust are not well pleasing.

22. The Lord is only for those who persevere for him in the way of truth and justice. 

23. The Most High does not approve of the gifts of the iniquitous. Neither does he have respect for the oblations of the unjust; neither will he forgive their sins because of the multitude of their sacrifices.

24. Whoever offers a sacrifice from the substance of the poor is like one who sacrifices the son in the sight of his father.

25. The bread of the indigent is the life of the poor. Whoever cheats them out of it is a man of blood.

26. Whoever takes away the bread of sweat is like one who kills his neighbor.

27. He who sheds blood, and he who cheats the hired hand out of his wages, are brothers.

28. When one builds and another destroys, what benefit do they have from their labor?

29. When one prays and another curses, whose voice will God heed?

30. He who washes himself after touching the dead, and then touches him again, what was the benefit of his washing?

31. Similarly, a man who fasts for his sins, and then does the same again, what was the benefit of his humbling himself? Who will heed his prayer? 

## Sirach 35

1. What sacrifices are pleasing to God.  Whoever observes the law multiplies oblations.

10. Render glory to God with a good heart. And you should not reduce the first-fruits of your hands.

11. With every gift, have a cheerful countenance, and sanctify your tithes with exultation.

12. Give to the Most High according to his gifts to you, and act with a good eye toward the creations of your hands.

13. For the Lord gives recompense, and he will repay you seven times as much.

14. Do not be willing to offer corrupt gifts. For he will not accept them. 

15. And do not be willing to consider an unjust sacrifice. For the Lord is the judge, and with him there is no favoritism toward anyone.

17. He will not despise the prayers of the orphan, nor of the widow, if she utters a lamenting complaint.

18. Do a widow’s tears not run down her cheek? And will her outcry not cause their downfall? 

19. For from her cheek, her tears ascend even to heaven. And the Lord, the One who listens, will not take delight in them.

20. Whoever adores God with joy will be accepted, and his prayer will reach even to the clouds.

21. The prayer of one who humbles himself will pierce the clouds. And it will not be consoled until it draws near; and it will not withdraw until the Most High beholds.

22. And the Lord will not delay, and he will judge for those who are just, and he will accomplish judgment. And the Almighty will not have patience with them, so that he may crush their back.

23. And he will repay vengeance to the Gentiles, until he has taken away the multitude of the arrogant, and broken the scepters of the iniquitous,

24. until he has rendered to men according to their deeds, and according to the works of Adam, and according to his presumption,

25. until he has judged the judgment of his people. And he will delight the just with his mercy.

26. The mercy of God is beautiful in the time of tribulation, like a rain cloud in the time of drought. 

## Sirach 36

2. And send your fear upon the Gentiles, who have not sought you, so that they may acknowledge that there is no God except you, and so that they may declare your great deeds.

3. Lift up your hand over unbelieving nations, so that they may see your power.36:3The word ‘gentes’ in this context refers to those who are unbelieving; in the context of the Jews of Old Testament times, this would refer to non-Jews, but in the context of the present-day, this would refer to non-Catholic, especially non-Christians. The word ‘alienas’ is often translated as strangers or foreigners, but here it refers more to nations or peoples other than those who believe.(Conte)

4. For just as, in their sight, you have been sanctified in us, so also, in our sight, you will be magnified in them.

17. Give testimony to those who have been your creations from the beginning, and lift up the prophecies which the former prophets spoke in your name. 

18. Give a reward to those who endure for you, so that your prophets may be found to be faithful. And heed the prayers of your servants,

19. in accord with the blessing of Aaron over your people. And direct us in the way of justice, and let all who inhabit the earth know that you are God, the Beholder of all ages.

28. Who will trust one who has no nest, and who conceals himself wherever his course may take him, like a well-equipped robber passing from city to city? 

## Sirach 37

1. Of the choice of friends and counsellors.  Every friend will say: “I also am a close friend.” But there is a friend who is a friend in name only. Is this not a grief even unto death?

2. But a companion and friend may turn into an enemy.

3. O wicked presumption! From what were you created that you would cover the dry land with your malice and deceitfulness?

4. A companion may rejoice with his friend in good times, but in a time of tribulation, he will be an adversary.

5. There is a companion who commiserates with a friend for the sake of the stomach, but he will shield himself from the enemy.

11. “Your own way is good.” But then he will stand at a distance to see what befalls you.

You should not speak with a woman about her who is a rival, nor with a coward about war, nor with a merchant about exaggeration, nor with a buyer about selling, nor with a spiteful man about giving thanks,37:12In the context of a merchant trying to sell his wares, the word ‘trajectione’ refers to exaggeration, to advertising hyperbole.(Conte)

13. nor with the impious about piety, nor with the dishonest about honesty, nor with the field worker about other kinds of work,

14. nor with a worker hired for a year about the end of the year, nor with a lazy servant about great works. You should pay no heed to these persons in any matter of counsel.

16. whose soul is in agreement with your own soul, and who, when you falter in the dark, will share your sorrows.

17. And establish a heart of good counsel within yourself. For there is nothing of greater usefulness to you than this.37:17In this context, ‘delaturam’ does not refer to a fear of detraction if one does not mourn, but to a sinking down into bitterness, willingly, for a day or so, and then accepting consolation.(Conte)

18. At any time, the soul of a holy man declares more truths than seven vigilant watchmen sitting in a high place.37:18In this context ‘detractionem’ does not refer to slander or to the fear of detraction, but to a removal, that is, to a loss of a human person created by God. The reason for mourning is not fear of accusation, but because of the loss to the world.(Conte)

19. But concerning all things, pray to the Most High, so that he may direct your way in truth.

20. In all your works, let a true word precede you, with steadfast counsel before every deed.

21. A wicked word can change the heart. From the heart four kinds of things arise: good and evil, life and death. And the tongue is continually their ruler. There is a man who is an astute teacher of many, and yet this is useless to his own soul.

23. Whoever speaks mere rhetoric is hateful; he will be deceived in every matter.

29. A wise man will inherit honor among the people, and his name will live in eternity.

30. Son, test your own mind in your life, and if it is lacking, you should not give it authority.

31. For not all things are fitting for all persons, and not every kind of thing is agreeable to every soul.

32. Do not choose to be eager during any feast, and you should not act with excess toward any food.

33. For in excessive eating there will be infirmity, and gluttony will continue even unto illness.

34. By excessive drinking, many have passed away. But he who abstains will add to his life. 

## Sirach 38

1. Of physicians and medicines: what is to be done in sickness, and how we are to mourn for the dead. Of the employments of labourers and artificers.  Honor the physician because of necessity, and because the Most High created him.

2. For all healing is from God, and so he will receive gifts from the King.

3. The expertise of the physician will lift up his head, and in the sight of great men, he will be praised.

14. Truly, they will beseech the Lord, so that he may direct their treatments and cures, for the sake of their way of life.

15. He who sins in the sight of the One who made him will fall into the hands of the physician.

17. And though you will sink down into bitterness, bear his mourning for one day, and then be consoled in your sadness.

18. And carry out his mourning, according to his merit, for one or two days because of this loss.

19. Yet sadness hastens death and overwhelms strength, and the sorrow of the heart bows down the neck.

20. When one is taken away, sorrow remains. But the resources of a destitute man is found in his heart.

21. You should not give your heart over to sadness, but push it away from you. And remember the very end.

22. Do not be willing to forget this; for there is no turning back. Otherwise, it will not benefit you, and you will cause great harm to yourself.

23. Call to mind my judgment. For so shall it be for you also. Yesterday is mine, and today is yours. 

24. When the deceased is at rest, let his memory rest also. And console him at the departure of his spirit.

25. The wisdom of a scribe is found in his time of leisure. So whoever has less to do will gain wisdom.38:25A scribe: That is, a doctor of the law, or, a learned man.(Challoner)

26. With what wisdom will someone be filled who holds the plow, and who boasts of the cattle prod that drives the oxen forward, and who is occupied in these labors, and whose only conversation is about the offspring of bulls? 

27. He will give his mind over to the plowing of furrows, and his vigilance to the fattening of the cows. 

28. Similarly, every craftsman and artisan, who crafts in the night as well as in the day, who sculpts graven seals, and who, by his diligence, varies the image, will give his mind over to the likeness of the image. And he will complete the work by his vigilance. 

29. The blacksmith, sitting by his anvil and considering a work of iron, is similar. The steam from the fire singes his flesh, and he struggles against the heat of the furnace.

30. The voice of the hammer is ever in his ears, and his eye is upon the pattern of the ironwork. 

31. He gives his heart to the completion of his work, and his vigilance adorns it to perfection.

32. The potter, sitting at his work and turning the wheel with his feet, is similar. He has settled into a continual concern for his work, and there is a rhythm in all that he does.

33. He forms the clay with his arm, and he bends his strength over his feet.

34. He will give his heart over to the completion of the glazing, and his vigilance to the cleansing of the furnace.

35. All these persons trust in their own hands, and each one is wise in his own art.

36. Without these persons, a city is not built.

37. But they will neither inhabit nor walk around in the city. And they will not go across to the church.

38. They will not sit upon the seats of judges, and they will not understand a decree of judgment. And they will not make clear discipline and judgment, and they will not be found to understand parables.

39. But they will strengthen the state of the world, and their prayer will be in their artistic works, applying their soul, and searching the law of the Most High.

41. And now, with the whole heart and mouth, give praise to him, and bless the name of the Lord.  

## Sirach 40

1. The miseries of the life of man are relieved by the grace of God and his fear.  A great occupation was created for all men, and a heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam, from the day of their departure from their mother’s womb, even until the day of their burial into the mother of all:

2. their thoughts, and the fears of their heart, their imagined expectations, and the day of their end,

3. from him who sits upon a glorious throne, even to him who is humbled in earth and ashes,

5. And in the time of rest upon his bed, the sleep of the night changes his knowledge.

6. There is little or no rest, and sleep is taken from him, as if on a day of keeping watch.

## Sirach 41

1. Of the remembrance of death: of an evil and of a good name: of what things we ought to be ashamed.  O death, how bitter is the memory of you: to a man who has peace in his substance,

2. to a quiet man, and to him whose ways are directed properly in all things, and who still has the strength to take nourishment.

3. O death, your judgment is good to the indigent man, and to him whose strength has diminished,

4. who is failing due to old age, and who is anxious about all things, and to the unbelieving man who has lost patience. 

5. Do not choose to dread the judgment of death. Remember the things that occurred before you, and the things that will occur after you. This judgment is from the Lord upon all flesh.

6. And what will happen to you is well-pleasing to the Most High, whether in ten, or one hundred, or one thousand years.

7. For death is no indictment of life.41:7The word ‘inferno’ can refer to Hell, but it can also refer to death in general, even for the good.(Conte)

19. Yet truly, have respect for these things which proceed from my mouth.41:19Have a shame, etc: That is to say, be ashamed of doing any of these things, which I am now going to mention; for though sometimes shamefacedness is not to be indulged: yet it is often good and necessary: as in the following cases.(Challoner)

20. For it is not good to observe every reverence. And all things do not please all persons in their beliefs.41:20You cannot please everyone, nor can you always avoid offending everyone. So respect for the opinions of others has its limits.(Conte)

21. Have shame of these things: of fornication before father and mother, and of a lie before the first leader and the powerful,41:21Shame, in the Biblical context, does not merely mean to be ashamed of something sinful or wrong. It also refers to modesty, to a feeling of unworthiness before God, to a reverence of others and a humbling of one’s self. Thus, we should have shame before the truth of God, and the covenant, and the bread that we eat (especially the consecrated bread of the Eucharist), and the humble place where you live.(Conte)

22. of a crime before a ruler or a judge, of iniquity before a congregation or a people,

23. of injustice before a companion or a friend, and of the place in which you live,

24. of theft, and of the truth before God, and of the covenant, of reclining to eat bread, and of deceitfulness in giving or receiving,

25. of silence before those who greet you, of looking upon a woman of fornication, and of averting your face from a relative.

## Sirach 42

1. Of what things we ought not to be ashamed. Cautions with regard to women. The works and greatness of God.  You should not repeat a claim heard from the revealing of a hidden word. And then, truly, you will be without shame, and you will find favor in the sight of all men. You should not accept the reputation of someone, so that you would sin, nor should you be confounded in any of the following things:

2. in the law of the Most High and his covenant, or by giving a judgment to justify the impious;42:2Notice that the first thing one should not have shame in is good (the law and the covenant), and the second thing is bad (unjust judgment). So there is a two-fold meaning: the type of shame where one feels shame in something that is actually good, wherein there is no reason for shame, and the type of shame which one feels shame for an immoral act, wherein there is reason for shame. Do not have shame in God’s covenant and in His law; follow the covenant and the law without shame. But then, do not have shame in unjust judgment by avoiding unjust judgment (not by doing it without shame).(Conte)

3. in a word among companions and fellow travelers, or by distributing the inheritance of friends;

4. in the fairness of scales and weights, or in acquiring much or little;

5. by the corruption of buying and negotiating, or in the ample discipline of children, or in causing the side of a wicked servant to bleed.

6. A seal is good over a wicked wife.

7. Where there are many hands, seal and deliver all things by number and weight; and truly, give and receive everything in writing.

8. You should not have shame in correcting the senseless, the foolish, and those youths who would judge their elders. And so shall you be well-instructed in all things and well-approved in the sight of all the living. 

9. The vigilance of a father for his daughter is hidden, and his concern for her takes away his sleep. For perhaps, in her adolescence, she might be brought into adulthood. Or when she lives with her husband, she might become hateful.

10. In her virginity, she might be defiled, and then she may be found to be pregnant in her father’s house. Or perhaps, when she lives with her husband, she might stray, or at least become barren.

11. Keep a close watch over a self-indulgent daughter. Otherwise, at some time, she might bring you into disgrace before your enemies, and into disrepute in the city, and into reproach among the people, and so she may confound you before the multitude of the people.

12. She should not choose to gaze upon the beauty of every man, and she should not choose to spend her time in the midst of married women.42:12This passage is advice concerning how one’s young unmarried daughter should behave, in order to retain chastity. So, the verb was changed in translation to the third person singular, feminine, from the second person singular imperative. Looking at the attractiveness of every man is harmful to her chastity. So is spending time with married women, who might talk about marital relations, perhaps even in a crass manner.(Conte)

13. For a moth goes forth from garments, and iniquity over a man goes forth from a woman.42:13Iniquity pertaining to men, i.e. sins committed because of her attraction to a man, proceeds from a woman. Again, this advice pertains to a young unmarried daughter and is in the context of the previous verse about avoiding sins related to attraction of a young unmarried daughter to men.(Conte)

14. Yet iniquity over a man is better for her than if a married woman, seeking to benefit her, instead leads her into confusion and disgrace.42:14Yet the iniquity of a man [sins of women pertaining to men] is better than a woman [an older married woman] seeking to benefit [the younger unmarried woman] and yet confusing her to her disgrace.(Conte)42:14The sense of verse 14 is that even though the problems a daughter might encounter, which are warned against in verse 13, are harmful, there is a worse situation, that of married women influencing your daughter, leading her into confusion and disgrace. This passage is not saying that men’s sins are better than women’s sins. Rather, it is advice as to how to advise and govern a young unmarried daughter. If she hangs around older women, they might think to ‘help’ her by giving her advice about men which is not fitting to someone who is young and unmarried, so instead of benefiting her, they would lead her into confusion and disgrace. In other words, hanging around older married women might corrupt your virgin unmarried daughter, since they might talk about men in a licentious manner.(Conte)42:14Better is the iniquity, etc: That is, there is, commonly speaking, less danger to be apprehended to the soul from the churlishness, or injuries we receive from men, than from the flattering favours and familiarity of women.(Challoner)

20. No thought passes by him unnoticed, and no word can conceal itself from him.

21. He has adorned the magnificent works of his wisdom. He is before eternity and even unto eternity. And nothing can be added,

22. and nothing can be taken away. And he has no need of any counselor.

23. And it will devour the mountains, and burn the wilderness, and extinguish the greenery, like a fire.

And the lowly dew will arrive to meet the heat and overpower it.43:24This is a prophetic figure for the Return of Jesus Christ on a cloud, and the return with Him of the lowly Virgin Mary; and at His Return, He will destroy the ardor of sin and of the sinful Antichrist (who will be of the kingdom of the North).(Conte)

17. And you explained mysteries by means of parables. Your name became known to far off islands, and you were beloved for your peace.

19. and over the name of the Lord God, who is known as the God of Israel.

20. You gathered gold like copper, and you multiplied silver like lead.

21. But you bent your thigh to women, and you were held by the power of your body.

22. You brought a stain upon your glory, and you profaned your seed, so as to bring wrath upon your children, and to incite your foolishness,

23. so that you would cause the kingdom to be divided, and an obstinate kingdom to rule from Ephraim.

24. But God will not abandon his mercy, nor will he corrupt or abolish his own works. And he will not perish the stock of the descendants of his elect. And he will not destroy the offspring of him who loves the Lord. 

25. Therefore, he left behind a remnant for Jacob and for David, from the same stock.

26. And Solomon had his end with his fathers.

27. And he left behind himself some of his offspring, as the folly of the nation:

28. both Rehoboam, who had little prudence, and who turned away the people by his counsel,

29. and Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin, and who provided a way of sin to Ephraim. And their sins were multiplied exceedingly.

30. They thoroughly turned them away from their own land.

31. And they sought every kind of wickedness, even until punishment overwhelmed them, and freed them from every kind of sin. 

## Sirach 48

1. The praise of Elias, of Eliseus, of Ezechias, and of Isaias.  And the prophet Elijah arose like a fire, and his word burned like a torch.

2. He brought a famine upon them, and those who provoked him in their envy became few. For they could not bear the precepts of the Lord.

3. By the word of the Lord, he closed the heavens, and he brought down fire from heaven three times.

4. In this way, Elijah was magnified in his wondrous works. So who can say that he is similar to you in glory?

5. He raised up a dead man from the grave, from the fate of death, by the word of the Lord God.

6. He threw down kings unto perdition, and he easily shattered their power and boasting from his bed.48:6Notice that ‘suo’ is singular, while ‘ipsorum’ is plural. The former refers to Elijah and the latter to the kings. Elijah was able to throw down kings from his bed (or couch); he did not even have to stand up to defeat them.(Conte)

7. He heeded the judgment at Sinai, and the judgments of punishment at Horeb.

8. He anointed kings unto repentance, and he chose the prophets who would follow after him.48:8The verb here is in the second person singular because the subject is represented by the pronoun ‘qui’ (who). But using ‘who’ in English when it is not a question is awkward, so the pronoun used in third person singular. Thus, ‘post te’ becomes ‘after him’.(Conte)

9. He was received into a whirlwind of fire, into a swift chariot with fiery horses.

10. He is written in the judgments of the times, so as to lessen the wrath of the Lord, to reconcile the heart of the father to the son, and to restore the tribes of Jacob. 

11. Blessed are those who saw you, and who were adorned with your friendship.

12. For we live only in our life, and after death, our name will not be the same.

13. Certainly, Elijah was covered by the whirlwind, and his spirit was completed in Elisha. In his days, he was not fearful of the ruler, and no power defeated him.

14. No word overwhelmed him, and after death, his body prophesied.

15. In his life, he gave great portents, and in death, he wrought miracles.

16. In all these things, the people did not repent, and they did not withdraw from their sins, even until they were cast out of their land, and were dispersed throughout all the earth. 

17. And there was left behind a people very few in number, but with a leader in the house of David.

18. Some of these did what pleased God. But others committed many sins.

19. Hezekiah fortified his city, and he brought water into its midst, and he dug into rock with iron, and he built a well for water.

20. In his days, Sennacherib rose up, and he sent Rabshakeh, and he lifted up his hand against them, and he extended his hand against Zion, and he became arrogant in his power.

21. Then their hearts and hands shook. And they were in pain, like women giving birth.

22. And they called upon the merciful Lord. And they spread their hands and lifted them up to heaven. And the holy Lord God quickly heeded their voice.

23. He was not mindful of their sins, and he did not give them over to their enemies. Instead, he purified them by the hand of Isaiah, the holy prophet.

24. He threw down the army of the Assyrians, and the Angel of the Lord crushed them.

25. For Hezekiah did what pleased God, and he went with fortitude in the way of David his father, just as he had been commanded by Isaiah, a prophet great and faithful in the sight of God.

26. In his days, the sun went backwards, and he added to the king’s life.

27. With a great spirit he saw the final things. And he consoled the mourners in Zion.

28. He revealed the future, even the distant future, and hidden things before they occurred.  

## Sirach 49

1. The praise of Josias, of Jeremias, Ezechiel, and the twelve prophets. Also of Zorobabel, Jesus the son of Josedech, Nehemias, Enoch, Joseph, Seth, Sem, and Adam.  The memory of Josiah is like a blend of fragrances composed by the work of a perfumer.

2. His remembrance will be sweet like honey in every mouth, and like music at a banquet of wine.

3. He was divinely directed for the repentance of the nation, and he took away the abominations of impiety.

4. And he guided his heart toward the Lord. And during the days of sinners, he strengthened piety.

5. Other than David, and Hezekiah, and Josiah, everyone committed sin.

6. For the kings of Judah abandoned the law of the Most High, and they held contempt for the fear of God.

7. For they gave their kingdom to foreigners, and their glory to a strange people.

8. They set fire to the chosen city of sanctity, and they made its streets desolate, in accord with the hand of Jeremiah.

9. For they treated him wickedly, though he was consecrated as a prophet from his mother’s womb: to overthrow, and to root out, and to destroy, and also to rebuild and to renew.

10. It was Ezekiel who saw a vision of glory, which was revealed to him with the chariot of the Cherubim.

11. For it called to mind the enemies under the figure of rain, to do good to those who have revealed the upright ways.

12. And may the bones of the twelve prophets spring up from their place. For they strengthened Jacob, and they redeemed themselves with a virtuous faith.

13. How will we magnify Zerubbabel? For he, too, was like a signet on the right hand. 

14. So also was Jesus, the son of Jozadak, who in their days built the house, and raised up a holy temple to the Lord, as a preparation for everlasting glory.

15. And may Nehemiah be remembered for a long time. He raised up for us the walls that had been torn down. And he made firm the gates and the bars. He raised up our houses.

16. No one has been born upon the earth like Enoch. And he was also taken up from the earth.

17. And there was no one like Joseph, who was a man born to be foremost among his brothers, the firmament of his clan, a guide to his brethren, the mainstay of his people.

18. And his bones were visited, and after death, they prophesied.49:18They prophesied: That is, by their being carried out of Egypt they verified the prophetic prediction of Joseph. Gen. 50.(Challoner)

19. Shem and Seth obtained glory among men. And above every soul, at the very beginning, was Adam. 

## Sirach 50

1. The praises of Simon the high priest. The conclusion.  Simon, the high priest, son of Onias: in his life, he propped up the house, and in his days, he strengthened the temple.

2. Even the height of the temple was established by him: the double building and the high walls of the temple.

3. In his days, waters flowed out from the wells, and these were full beyond measure, like the sea.

4. He cared for his nation, and he freed it from perdition.

5. He prevailed, so as to enlarge the city. And he obtained glory by his behavior among the people. And he enlarged the entrance of the house and of the atrium.

6. He shined in his days like the morning star through the midst of a cloud, and like the full moon.

7. And he shined forth in the temple of God in this manner: like the sun when it shines brightly,

8. and like a rainbow shining amid clouds of glory, and like flowering roses in the days of spring, and like lilies along the water’s edge, and like sweet smelling frankincense in the days of summer,

9. like a fire shining brightly, and like frankincense burning within a fire,

10. like a vessel of solid gold, adorned with every precious stone,

11. like an olive tree producing buds, and like a cypress tree lifting itself on high, when he received the robe of glory and was vested with the consummation of virtue.50:11Clothed with the perfection of power: That is, with all the vestments denoting his dignity and authority.(Challoner) 

12. He gave glory to the vestment of sanctity, when he ascended to the holy altar.

13. Then, when he received the portions from the hands of the priests, he himself stood next to the altar. And around him was the crown of his brethren, like a cedar planted on a mountain of Lebanon.

14. And they stood around him like palm branches, and all were sons of Aaron in their glory.

15. Then the oblation of the Lord was in their hands, in the sight of the entire synagogue of Israel. And completing his service at the altar, so as to magnify the offering to the Most High King,

16. he extended his hand to make a libation, and he offered from the blood of the grape.

17. At the base of the altar, he poured out a divine fragrance to the Most High Prince. 

18. Then the sons of Aaron shouted; they sounded finely-made trumpets, and they made a great noise, as a memorial in the sight of God.

19. Then all the people at once hurried forward, and they fell to the ground on their faces, to adore the Lord their God, and to offer prayers to Almighty God Most High.

20. And the singers of Psalms raised their voices, and a full sweet sound increased in the great house.

21. And the people petitioned the Most High Lord in prayer, even until the honor of the Lord was completed, and they finished offering their gifts. 

22. Then, descending, he extended his hands over the entire congregation of the sons of Israel, to give glory to God from his lips, and to glory in his name.

23. And he repeated his prayer, wanting to reveal the virtue of God.

24. And now, pray to the God of all, who has accomplished great things over all the earth, who has increased our days from our mother’s womb, and who has acted toward us in accord with his mercy. 

25. May he give us joyfulness in heart, and may there be peace in our days, in Israel for unending days,

26. so that Israel may trust the mercy of God to be with us, in order to free us in his days.

27. Two nations my soul hates, and a third, which I hate, is not a nation:50:27Abhorres: Viz., with a holy indignation, as enemies of God and persecutors of his people. Such were then the Edomites who abode in mount Seir, the Philistines, and the Samaritans who dwelt in Sichem, and had their schismatical temple in that neighbourhood.(Challoner)

28. those who sit upon mount Seir, and the Philistines, and the foolish people who live at Shechem.

1. A prayer of praise and thanksgiving.  The prayer of Jesus, the son of Sirach: I will confess to you, O Lord and King, and I will give praise to you, O God my Savior.

2. I will acknowledge your name. For you have been my Helper and Protector.

3. And you have freed my body from perdition, from the snare of the iniquitous tongue, and from the lips of those who forge lies. And you have been my Helper in the sight of those who stood nearby.

4. And you have freed me according to the multitude of the mercy of your name: from those who roared and prepared to devour,

5. from the hands of those who sought my life, and from the gates of tribulation that surrounded me,

6. from the oppression of the flames that surrounded me, and so I was not burned in the midst of the fire,

7. from the depths of the bowels of hell, and from the defiled tongue, and from lying words, from an iniquitous king, and from an unjust tongue.

8. My soul shall praise the Lord, even unto death.

9. For my life was drawing near to hell below.

10. And they surrounded me on every side. And there was no one who would help me. I looked around for the assistance of men, and there was none.

11. Then I remembered your mercy, O Lord, and your works, which are from the very beginning.

12. For you rescue those who persevere for you, O Lord, and you free them from the hands of the Gentiles.51:12In the Christian interpretation of Scripture, the Gentiles would refer to non-believers (heathens), not to non-Jews.(Conte)

13. You exalted my habitation upon the earth, and I made supplication that death would pass away.

14. I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord, so that he would not abandon me in the day of my tribulation, nor in the time of arrogance without assistance.

15. I will praise your name unceasingly, and I will praise it with thanksgiving, for my prayer was heeded.

16. And you freed me from perdition, and you rescued me from the time of iniquity.

17. Because of this, I will give thanks and praise to you, and I will bless the name of the Lord.

18. When I was still young, before I wandered astray, I sought wisdom openly in my prayer.

19. I asked for her before the temple, and even to the very end, I will inquire after her. And she flourished like a newly-ripened grape.

21. I bent my ear a little and accepted her.

22. I found much wisdom within myself, and I benefited greatly by her. 

23. I will give glory to him who gives wisdom to me.

24. For I have decided that I should act according to wisdom. I have been zealous for what is good, and so I will not be confounded.

25. My soul has struggled for wisdom, and in doing so, I have been confirmed.

26. I extended my hands on high, and I mourned my ignorance of her.
