# Acts

## Acts 1

1. IN my first book, Theophilus, I told of all that Jesus did and taught from the beginning

2. down to the day when, after giving commands, through the Holy Spirit, to the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up to heaven.

3. By many proofs he revealed himself to these men as still alive after his sufferings; for he was seen by them for forty days and spoke of things relating to the kingdom of God.

4. Also while eating with them, he charged them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, "which," said he, "you have heard from me.

5. For John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days hence."

6. When they came together, they asked him, "Master, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?"

7. He said to them, "It is not yours to know the times and seasons which the Father has put under his own authority.

8. But you will receive power after the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be witnesses for me in Jerusalem and in all Judaea and in Samaria and to the ends of the earth."

9. He said this and then, while they were looking on, he was taken up and a cloud lifted him from their sight.

10. They were gazing into the sky as he went, when suddenly two men in white robes were standing beside them

11. and said, "Men of Galilee, why are you standing and looking up into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way that you have seen him go into heaven."

12. They then returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called the Olive Orchard, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey distant.

13. When they came into the city, they went up to the upper room where they were staying. There were Peter and John, and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.

14. All of these continued earnestly and unitedly in prayer with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brothers.

15. In those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren 

16. "Brethren, it was necessary that the Scripture should be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became guide to those who arrested Jesus.

17. For he was numbered among us and received a share in this service.

18. (This man bought a piece of land with the price of his wickedness, and falling headlong he burst asunder and all his entrails were poured out.

19. It became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that that field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, the Field of Blood.)

20. For it is written in the book of Psalms, 'Let his dwelling become desolate and let there be no one living in it,' and, 'His overseership let another take.'

21. It is needful, therefore, that of the men who have been with us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,

22. from the baptism of John down to the day that he was taken up from us \'97 that one of these should become a witness with us of his resurrection."

23. So they put forward two, Joseph who is called Barsabbas, surnamed Justus, and Matthias.

24. In prayer they said, "O Lord, thou who knowest the hearts of all, show which one of these two thou has chosen

25. to take the place in this service and apostleship which Judas deserted to go to his own place."

26. Then they cast lots between them. The lot fell on Matthias and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

## Acts 2

1. DURING the course of the day of Pentecost they were all together in the same place,

2. when suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of a strong rushing wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.

3. Then there appeared to them, as it were, tongues of flame distributing themselves, and one rested on each of them.

4. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in foreign tongues, as the Spirit gave them power of expression.

5. There were Jews living in Jerusalem, pious men from every nation under heaven.

6. When this sound was heard, the crowd came together and were astonished because each one heard them speaking in his own language.

7. They were amazed and, wondering, said, "Are not all these who are talking, Galilaean?

8. How then does each of us hear them in his own native language?

9. Parthians and Medes and Elamites and those who live in Mesopotamia, Judas and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,

10. Phrygia and Pamphilia, Egypt and the regions of Libya toward Cyrene, visitors from Rome, Jews and proselytes,

11. Cretans and Arabians \'97 we hear them speaking in our languages the mighty works of God."

12. They were all astonished and at a loss, one saying to another, "What does this mean?"

13. Some scoffingly said, "They are full of sweet wine."

14. But Peter, standing up with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them: "Fellow Jews, and all of you who live in Jerusalem, understand this and listen to my words.

15. These are not drunk, as you assume, for it is only nine o'clock in the morning;

16. but this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:

17. 'It will be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all mankind, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy, and your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams.

18. Yes, upon the slave men and slave girls that are mine I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.

19. I will give portents in heaven above and signs on the earth beneath, blood and fire and vapor of smoke.

20. The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the day of the Lord comes \'97 that great and glorious day.

21. And every one who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.'

22. Fellow Israelites, listen to these words: Jesus the Nazarene was a man proved to be sent to you from God by miracles, wonders, and signs which God did through him in the midst of you, as you yourselves know.

23. But when he had been delivered up according to the fixed purpose and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed him through the hands of lawless men.

24. But God freed him from the pangs of death and raised him up, since it was impossible that he should be held under the power of death.

25. For David says of him, 'I saw the Lord always before my face, for he is at my right hand so that I may not be cast down.

26. Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices, and my flesh still dwells in hope

27. that thou wilt not leave my soul to Hades and wilt not let thy holy one see decay.

28. Thou makest me know the paths of life. Thou wilt fill me with joy in thy presence.'

29. "Brethren, allow me to say frankly to you regarding the patriarch David that he died and was buried and his tomb is among us to this day.

30. But being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn to him an oath to place a descendant of his body upon his throne,

31. he foreseeing spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, saying that he was not left to Hades and that his flesh did not see decay.

32. This Jesus, God raised up, and all of us are witnesses of it.

33. Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which you see and hear.

34. For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says, 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,

35. till I make your enemies your footstool.'

36. Let all the house of Israel know surely that this Jesus, whom you crucified, God has made both Lord and Christ."

37. Hearing this they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, "What shall we do, brethren?"

38. Peter said to them, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

39. For the promise belongs to you and to your children and to all those who are far off, as many as the Lord your God may call."

40. With many other words he bore witness and exhorted them, "Save yourselves from this perverse generation."

41. Those who accepted his message were baptized, and there were added on that day about three thousand souls.

42. These gave constant attention to the teaching of the apostles and to the fellowship and the breaking of bread and the prayers.

43. Awe came on every soul. Many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.

44. All who believed had all things together in common.

45. They would sell their lands and goods and distribute to all as any one had need.

46. Every day, continuing with one accord in the Temple courts and in breaking bread from house to house, they ate together in joy and simplicity of heart,

47. praising God and having favor with all the people. The Lord added daily to their number those who were being saved.

## Acts 3

1. PETER and John were going up into the Temple courts at the hour of prayer, three o'clock,

2. when a man lame from his birth was being carried along. This man used to be placed every day near the gate of the Temple courts \'97 the one called the Beautiful Gate \'97 to beg of those who were entering.

3. Seeing Peter and John about to go into the Temple courts, he begged to receive something.

4. But Peter fixing his eyes on him, along with John, said, "Look at us."

5. He gave attention to them, expecting to receive something from them.

6. But Peter said, "Silver and gold I have not; but what I have I will give you. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, walk."

7. Grasping his right hand he lifted him up. Immediately his feet and ankles became strong,

8. and he sprang up and stood and walked and entered the Temple court with them, walking and leaping and praising God.

9. All the people saw him walking about and praising God,

10. and when they recognized that it was he who had sat begging at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple court, they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.

11. While he still clung to Peter and John, all the people ran crowding around them in what was called Solomon's Colonnade, greatly astonished.

12. Peter, seeing the people, explained, "Fellow Israelites, why do you wonder at this, or why do you gaze so at us, as if by our own power or piety we had made him walk?

13. The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus whom you delivered up and disowned before Pilate when he had decided to release him.

14. You disowned the holy and righteous one and begged to have a murderer granted you.

15. You killed the Author of life, but God raised him from the dead. Of this we are witnesses.

16. And now by faith in his name this man whom you see and know has been made strong by his name, and the faith that is through him has given this man this perfect soundness before you all.

17. "Now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance, as also your rulers did.

18. God in this way fulfilled what he had predicted through the mouths of all the prophets that his Christ should suffer.

19. Therefore, repent and turn about, that your sins may be wiped away and the gracious face of the Lord may bring times of refreshing,

20. and he may send Jesus Christ, long ago appointed,

21. but whom heaven must receive until the times of the restoration of all things, of which God spoke through the mouths of his holy prophets of old.

22. "Moses indeed said, 'The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet from among your brethren, as he raised me; listen to all that he may say to you.

23. It shall be that every person who does not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people.'

24. And all the prophets, Samuel and those who followed him, all who spoke, also foretold these days.

25. You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God established with your fathers when he said to Abraham, 'In your descendants all the families of the earth will be blessed.'

26. To you first God, when he raised up his servant, sent him, to bless you by turning each one of you from his wicked ways."

## Acts 4

1. WHILE they were speaking to the people, the priests and the commandant of the Temple and the Sadducees came upon them,

2. being offended because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in the case of Jesus the resurrection from the dead.

3. They laid hands on them and placed them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening.

4. But many of those who had heard the message believed, and the number of the men grew to be about five thousand.

5. On the next day there was a gathering of their rulers and elders and scribes in Jerusalem,

6. with Annas the High Priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and all who were of high priestly race.

7. They placed the apostles in the midst and asked them, "By what power and in what name did you do this?"

8. Then Peter, full of the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers of the people and elders,

9. if we must answer to-day regarding a benefit done to an infirm man, by what name he has been healed,

10. be it known to all of you and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead \'97 by this name, this man stands here before you sound.

11. This is the stone which was despised by you the builders, and which has become the corner stone.

12. Nor is there salvation in any other. For there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved."

13. Observing the fearless outspokenness of Peter and John and perceiving that they were common, uneducated men, they were astonished, and they recognized them as former companions of Jesus.

14. Seeing the man who had been healed standing there with the apostles, they had nothing to say in opposition.

15. After ordering them to go out of the council, they conferred together,

16. saying, "What shall we do to these men? For that a notable miracle has been done by them is plain to all who live in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.

17. But that it may not spread further among the people, let us sternly forbid them to speak any longer in this name to any one."

18. So, calling them in, they commanded them absolutely not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus.

19. But Peter and John answered them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves.

20. We, for our part, cannot refrain from saying what we have seen and heard."

21. The Council after further threats set them at liberty, not finding any way to punish them on account of the people; for all were giving glory to God because of what had happened.

22. For the man upon whom this miracle of healing had been performed was more than forty years old.

23. The apostles upon being released came to their friends and told them all that the high priests and the elders had said.

24. They hearing it unitedly lifted up their prayer to God and said, "O Lord, thou who didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea and all things that are in them,

25. who through the Holy Spirit by the mouth of our father David, thy servant, didst say, 'Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things?

26. The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers are gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ' \'97

27. for truly in this city Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered against thy holy servant Jesus,

28. to do all that thy hands and thy will had predetermined should take place \'97

29. now, Lord, look upon their threats and enable thy servants to speak thy message with all fearlessness,

30. while thou dost stretch out thine hand for healing and while signs and wonders are done through the name of thy holy servant Jesus."

31. After this prayer the place in which they were assembled was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the message of God with courageous freedom.

32. The multitude of those who had believed was of one heart and one soul, and no one said that any part of his property was his own, but they had all things in common.

33. With great power the apostles continued to bear witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Great grace was upon them all.

34. Nor was any one in need among them, for all who were owners of lands or houses would sell them and bring the money for what had been sold

35. and lay it at the apostles' feet, and it would be distributed to each as he had need.

36. Joseph, to whom the apostles had given the name Barnabas, which means "Son of Encouragement," a Levite born in Cyprus,

37. being the owner of a farm, sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.

## Acts 5

1. BUT a man called Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a piece of property

2. and kept back a part of the price, with his wife's connivance, and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles' feet.

3. Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the price of the land?

4. While you had it, was it not yours? And after it was sold, was it not at your own disposal? Why have you conceived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God."

5. When Ananias heard these words he fell down and died. Great fear came upon all who heard these words.

6. Then the young men arose and wrapped him in a shroud and carried him out and buried him.

7. After an interval of about three hours, Ananias' wife came in, not knowing what had happened.

8. Peter asked her, "Tell me, did you sell the land for so much?" She answered, "Yes, for so much."

9. Peter said to her, "Why was it agreed between you to test the Spirit of the Lord? Even now the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out."

10. Immediately she fell down at his feet and died. The young men came in and found her dead, and carried her out and buried her beside her husband.

11. Great awe came upon the whole church and upon all who heard these things.

12. Many signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles. They were all with one purpose in Solomon's Colonnade.

13. Of the rest no one dared join them, but the people honored them highly.

14. Believers in the Lord were more and more being added, crowds both of men and of women,

15. so that they carried out the sick into the streets and laid them on couches and pallets with the hope that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some one of them.

16. A crowd was coming too from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing sick people and those who were troubled by impure spirits, and these were all being healed.

17. But the High Priest and all his party \'97 the sect of the Sadducees \'97 became aroused and filled with indignation,

18. and laid hands on the apostles and put them into the public jail.

19. But an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors in the night and led them out and said,

20. "Go, stand and speak to the people in the Temple courts all the words of this life."

21. On hearing this they went into the Temple courts about daybreak and began teaching. When the High Priest and his party arrived, they called together the Council and all the eldership of the children of Israel and sent to the jail to have the men brought.

22. But when the officers came there they did not find them in the prison. They returned and reported,

23. "We found the prison shut with all security and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened we found no one inside."

24. On hearing these words the commandant of the Temple and the high priests were at a loss as to what this would grow into.

25. Then some one came and told them, "The men whom you put in jail are standing in the Temple courts and teaching the people."

26. Then the commandant with his subordinates went and brought them, but without violence, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people.

27. They brought them in and made them stand before the Council. The High Priest asked them,

28. "Did we not strictly order you not to teach in this name? And here you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and want to bring this man's blood on us."

29. Peter, answering for the apostles, said, "God must be obeyed rather than men.

30. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you had killed by hanging him on a cross.

31. God has exalted him as Leader and Savior at his own right hand to give to Israel change of heart and forgiveness of sins.

32. We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit which God has given to those who obey him."

33. On hearing this they became furious and wanted to kill them.

34. But a certain Pharisee named Gamaliel \'97 a teacher of the law honored by all the people \'97 arose in the Council and, after directing that the men should be taken outside for a little while,

35. said, "Men of Israel, consider carefully what you are going to do to these men.

36. For before these days arose Theudas, professing to be somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves to him. But he was slain and all who followed him were scattered and came to naught.

37. After him arose Judas the Galilean, in the days of the Census, and led away people after him. He too perished, and all who followed him were scattered.

38. And now I advise you to keep away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or work is of men it will collapse,

39. but if it is of God you will not be able to suppress them. You might even be found to be fighting against God."

40. They were persuaded by him. So they called in the apostles and gave them a flogging and ordered them not to go on speaking in the name of Jesus, and then set them at liberty;

41. but they went away from before the Council rejoicing because they were thought worthy to be put to shame for the Name.

42. And every day in the Temple courts and from house to house they unceasingly taught and told the good news of Jesus the Christ.

## Acts 6

1. IN those days, when the number of disciples was increasing, the Greek-speaking Jews began to grumble at the Hebrew Jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily service.

2. Then the twelve called the body of disciples together and said, "We do not wish to leave the message of God and wait on tables.

3. Therefore, brethren, pick out seven men from among you, men of reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, and we will appoint them to look after this need.

4. But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the service of the message."

5. This proposal pleased the whole body. So they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolaus, a proselyte from Antioch.

6. These they presented before the apostles, who after prayer laid their hands upon them.

7. The message of God continued to spread and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem increased greatly, and even a great body of the priests were obedient to the faith.

8. Stephen, full of grace and of power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people.

9. But certain persons from what was called the synagogue of the Libyans and Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and some from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and disputed with Stephen;

10. yet they could not hold their own against the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke.

11. Then they got some men to say, "We have heard him speaking profane words against Moses and against God."

12. They excited the people and the elders and the scribes, and coming suddenly upon Stephen they arrested him and led him to the Council.

13. There they put forward false witnesses who said, "This man never ceases saying things against this holy place and the law.

14. We have heard him say that this Jesus, the Nazarene, will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses handed down to us."

15. All who were sitting in the Council as they looked at him saw that his face was like the face of an angel.

## Acts 7

1. THE High Priest said, "Are these things true?"

2. Stephen said: "Brethren and Fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,

3. and said to him, 'Leave your land and your kindred and go into whatever land I shall show you.'

4. Then he came out from the land of the Chaldaeans and settled in Haran. From there, after the death of his father, God removed him into this land in which you now live,

5. but he did not give him any inheritance in it, not even a foot of it. Still he promised to give it as a possession to him and to his descendants after him, though at that time he had no child.

6. God spoke thus, 'His descendants will sojourn in a land not their own, and they will be enslaved and maltreated four hundred years.'

7. And God said, 'That nation by which they are enslaved I will judge, and after that they shall come out and serve me in this place.'

8. God gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. So Abraham circumcised his son Isaac on the eighth day, and Isaac circumcised his son Jacob, and Jacob circumcised his sons, the twelve patriarchs.

9. "The patriarchs becoming jealous of Joseph sold him into Egypt. But God was with him

10. and delivered him out of all his trials, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him governor over the land of Egypt and all his own house.

11. Then there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and great distress, and our fathers found no food.

12. When Jacob heard that there was food in Egypt he sent our fathers the first time.

13. On their second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family was made known to Pharaoh.

14. Then Joseph sent and invited down Jacob his father and all his relatives, seventy-five persons,

15. and Jacob went down into Egypt and died there \'97 he and our fathers.

16. They were brought to Shechem and buried in the tomb which Abraham bought for a price in silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.

17. "As the time drew near for the fulfillment of the promise which God had made to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt

18. until there arose to rule over Egypt a different king, who did not know Joseph.

19. He adopted a crafty policy toward our race and oppressed our fathers, forcing them to expose their babes so that they should not be kept alive.

20. "At that time Moses was born, and was beautiful in God's sight. For three months he was cared for in his father's house.

21. When he had been exposed, Pharaoh's daughter took him up and reared him as her own son.

22. Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was strong in words and in deeds.

23. When he reached the age of forty years it came into his heart to look after his brethren, the children of Israel.

24. Seeing one of them being wronged, he defended him and did justice for the injured man by striking down the Egyptian.

25. He thought that his brethren knew that God would give them freedom through his hand. But they did not understand it.

26. On the next day Moses appeared when two of them were fighting, and tried to make peace between them, saying, 'Men, you are brethren. Why are you injuring each other?'

27. But he who was injuring his neighbor pushed him away, saying, 'Who appointed you a ruler and judge over us?

28. Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'

29. At that word Moses fled and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, and there he had two sons.

30. "When forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the desert of Mount Sinai in the flames of a burning bush.

31. When Moses saw the sight he was astonished, but as he was approaching to look closely, the voice of the Lord was heard,

32. 'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.' Then Moses trembled and did not dare to look closely.

33. The Lord said to him, 'Loose your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.

34. I have plainly seen the distress of my people in Egypt and I have heard their groans and have come down to deliver them. Come now and I will send you to Egypt.'

35. "This Moses whom they disowned, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and judge?' \'97 this man God sent as ruler and deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.

36. This man led them out, doing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and at the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years.

37. This is the Moses who said, 'God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brethren.'

38. This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him in Mount Sinai and with our fathers, and he received the living words to give to us.

39. Our fathers would not obey him, but thrust him away and turned back in their hearts toward Egypt,

40. saying to Aaron, 'Make us gods to lead us; for this Moses, who led us out of the land of Egypt \'97 we do not know what has become of him.'

41. And they made the image of a calf in those days and brought sacrifices to the idol and rejoiced in the work of their own hands.

42. So God turned and gave them up to worship the stars of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets, 'Did you offer to me slaughtered animals and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?

43. No, you carried the tent of Moloch and the star of the god Rephan, the images that you made for worship. Therefore I will remove you beyond Babylon.'

44. "In the wilderness our fathers had the Tent of the Testimony made as he who spoke to Moses directed, according to the model which he had seen.

45. This Tent our fathers who were with Joshua received in their turn and brought into the land of the nations whom God drove out from before our fathers, and it remained until the days of David.

46. He found favor with God and prayed that he might provide a temple for the house of Israel.

47. But Solomon built for him a house.

48. Yet the Most High does not dwell in buildings made by hands; as the prophet says,

49. 'Heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool. What sort of house will you build for me, says the Lord, or what is my place of rest?

50. Did not my hand make all these things?'

51. "You stiff-necked men, uncircumcised in hearts and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit! As your fathers did, so do you.

52. Which one of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? Yes, they killed those who announced in advance the coming of the righteous one of whom now you have become the betrayers and murderers \'97

53. you who received the law as it was transmitted by angels and have not kept it."

54. As they listened to these things they were cut to the heart and ground their teeth at him.

55. But he being full of the Holy Spirit looked up into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at God's right hand,

56. and he said, "I see heaven opened and the Son of Man standing at God's right hand!"

57. With a great shout they stopped their ears and rushed upon him with one purpose,

58. and hurried him out of the city and stoned him. The witnesses laid down their cloaks at the feet of a young man named Saul.

59. They stoned Stephen as he was praying and saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."

60. Kneeling he cried aloud, "Lord, do not lay up this sin against them!" After saying this he fell asleep.

## Acts 8

1. SAUL also approved of their putting him to death. On that day arose a great persecution of the church in Jerusalem. All except the apostles were scattered through Judaea and Samaria.

2. Pious men carried Stephen away for burial and made great lamentation over him.

3. Saul cruelly hounded the church from house to house, entering and dragging out men and women and handing them over into prison.

4. Those who were scattered went to various places telling the good news.

5. Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed the Christ to them.

6. The crowds with one mind gave attention to what was said by Philip, listening to his words and seeing the signs that he did.

7. For impure spirits came out shrieking from many who had been possessed, and many paralytic and lame people were healed.

8. There was great rejoicing in that city.

9. A certain man named Simon had previously been practicing magic in the city and astonishing the people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great one.

10. They had all given attention to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, "This man is the power of God which is called great."

11. They had given attention to him because for a long time he had amazed them by his magic.

12. But when they believed Philip, who was telling the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.

13. Simon himself also believed and was baptized and attached himself to Philip, and seeing the signs and great miracles that took place he was astonished.

14. When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the message of God, they sent to them Peter and John.

15. They on arrival prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit.

16. For the Spirit had not yet fallen on any one of them; they had merely been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.

17. Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.

18. When Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,

19. saying, "Give to me also this power that whoever I lay hands on may receive the Holy Spirit."

20. But Peter said to him, "Your money perish with you because you have thought that you could buy the gift of God with money!

21. You have no part or lot in this matter. For your heart is not right before God.

22. Repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray the Lord that, if possible, the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.

23. For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and the fetters of unrighteousness."

24. Simon answered, "You pray for me to the Lord that nothing of what you have said may come on me."

25. So when they had borne their testimony and had spoken the message of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, telling the good news in many villages of the Samaritans.

26. An angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Arise and go south-ward on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza, the road through the desert."

27. He arose and went. Now there was a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of high rank under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over her treasury. He had been to Jerusalem to worship

28. and was on his return, sitting in his chariot and reading the prophet Isaiah.

29. The Spirit said to Philip, "Go up and join this chariot."

30. Philip ran up and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, "Do you understand what you are reading?"

31. He said, "How can I without some one to guide me?" He begged Philip to come up and sit with him.

32. The passage of Scripture that he was reading was, "He was led as a sheep to slaughter, and as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, so he did not open his mouth.

33. In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who will describe his generation? For his life is taken away from the earth."

34. The eunuch said to Philip, "Please tell me, of whom is the prophet speaking \'97 of himself or of some one else?"

35. Philip opened his mouth and beginning with that Scripture told him the good news about Jesus.

36. As they were going along the road they came to water, and the eunuch said, "Here is water. What is there to hinder my being baptized?"

37. TEXT OMITTED

38. He ordered the chariot to stop and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.

39. When they had come up out of the water, the Spirit caught away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more. He went on his way rejoicing.

40. But Philip found himself at Azotus, and passing through all the cities he told the good news until he came to Casarea.

## Acts 9

1. SAUL was still breathing out threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord. He went to the High Priest

2. and asked from him letters to the synagogues in Damascus, that if he should find any persons who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.

3. On his journey he was getting near to Damascus when suddenly a light from heaven flashed round him.

4. He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?"

5. He asked, "Who is speaking?" The answer was, "I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.

6. But stand up and go into the city and it will be told you what you must do."

7. The men who were on the road with him stood struck dumb, hearing the voice, but seeing no one.

8. Saul rose from the earth and opened his eyes, but he could see nothing. Taking him by the hand they led him into Damascus,

9. and he was three days without seeing, and neither ate nor drank.

10. There was in Damascus a certain disciple named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias." He answered, "Here I am, Lord."

11. The Lord said to him, "Rise and go to the street called Straight street, and ask in the house of Judas for a man named Saul from Tarsus. He is now in prayer,

12. and has seen a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him in order that he may receive his sight."

13. Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard about this man from many people \'97 how many wicked things he has done to thy holy ones in Jerusalem,

14. and here he has authority from the high priests to bind all who call upon thy name."

15. But the Lord said to him, "Go, for this man is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before nations and kings and the children of Israel.

16. I will show him how much he must suffer for my name."

17. Ananias went and entered the house and put his hands on Saul, and said, "Brother Saul, the Lord has sent me \'97 Jesus who appeared to you on the road as you were coming \'97 that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."

18. Immediately scales seemed to fall from his eyes and he could see, and he arose and was baptized,

19. and after taking food he regained his strength. Saul passed some days with the disciples who were in Damascus,

20. and at once he began to proclaim in the synagogues that Jesus was the Son of God.

21. All who heard him were astonished and said, "Is not this the man who in Jerusalem persecuted those who call on this name, and who came here for the very purpose of binding and taking them to the high priests?"

22. But Saul grew stronger and put to confusion the Jews who lived at Damascus, as he proved that this man was the Christ.

23. When a number of days had passed, the Jews plotted to put him out of the way,

24. but this became known to Saul. They watched the gates day and night to seize him.

25. But the disciples took him at night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.

26. When Saul reached Jerusalem, he tried to attach himself to the disciples, but all were afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.

27. But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord on the road and how the Lord had spoken to him, and how courageously he had spoken in Damascus in the name of Jesus.

28. After that Saul was with them in Jerusalem, going out and in

29. and speaking freely in the name of the Lord. He frequently spoke and debated with the Greek-speaking Jews. But they kept trying to put him out of the way.

30. When the brethren learned of it, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.

31. So the church had peace throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and was built up, and advancing in the reverence of the Lord and by the encouragement of the Holy Spirit grew continually in numbers.

32. It happened that Peter, while passing about among all the holy, came down also to those who were dwelling at Lydda.

33. He found there a man named Aeneas who had been for eight years lying on a pallet, for he was a paralytic.

34. Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ is healing you. Rise up and make your bed." Immediately he arose.

35. All who were living in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.

36. In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha 

37. It happened at that time that she fell sick and died. They bathed her and laid her out in an upper room.

38. Since Lydda was near to Joppa and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him begging him, "Do not delay to come on down to us."

39. Peter arose and went along with them. On his arrival they took him up to the room. All of the widows came around him wailing and showing the tunics and cloaks that Dorcas had made while she was with them.

40. Peter sent them all out and kneeling down he prayed. Then turning to the body he said, "Tabitha, rise." She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up.

41. Giving her his hand he raised her to her feet. Then calling the holy and the widows he presented her to them alive.

42. This became known through all Joppa and many believed in the Lord.

43. Peter stayed in Joppa many days with a man named Simon, a tanner.

## Acts 10

1. THERE was in Caesarea a man named Cornelius, a centurion in the battalion called the Italian cohort.

2. He was a pious man, reverencing God with all his household, doing many acts of charity to the people and praying to God constantly.

3. About three o'clock one afternoon he saw plainly in a vision an angel come in and say to him, "Cornelius."

4. He gazed at him in alarm and asked, "What is it, my Lord?" The angel said to him, "Your prayers and your gifts of charity have come up as an evidence before God.

5. Now send men to Joppa and ask for a man named Simon, who is called Peter.

6. He is the guest of a certain Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside."

7. When the angel who had been speaking to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a pious soldier of those who were attached to him,

8. and, after explaining everything to them, sent them to Joppa.

9. On the next day, while they were on the road and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray. It was about noon.

10. He began to feel hungry and wished to eat. While they were preparing food, he fell into a trance

11. and saw the heavens opened and something descending like a great sheet being let down to the ground by the four corners.

12. In it were all kinds of fourfooted animals and reptiles and birds of the air.

13. Then a voice came to him, "Rise, Peter, kill and eat."

14. But Peter said, "By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything unclean or impure."

15. A second time the voice came to him, "What God has cleansed you must not think unclean."

16. This happened a third time, and then immediately the sheet was taken up into the heavens.

17. Peter was thinking this over and was at a loss what the vision meant. Just then the men who had been sent by Cornelius, after inquiring for the house of Simon, came to the door

18. and called to know whether Simon called Peter was a guest there.

19. While Peter was debating with himself about the vision, the Spirit said, "Here are two men looking for you.

20. Rise and go down and go with them without misgivings, for I have sent them."

21. Peter went down and said to the men, "Here I am \'97 the man you are looking for. What is the reason for your coming?"

22. They said, "Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house, and to listen to your words."

23. Then he invited them in and entertained them. The next day Peter arose and went away with them, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.

24. On the following day they came to Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had assembled his relatives and his close friends.

25. As Peter was about to enter, Cornelius met him and falling at his feet did him reverence.

26. But Peter lifted him up, saying, "Stand up; I myself also am a man."

27. Conversing with him Peter entered the house and found many people assembled.

28. He said to them, "You understand that it is against our Law for a Jew to be closely associated with a Gentile or to visit him. But God has taught me not to call any person common or unclean.

29. Therefore when I was sent for I came without making any objection. So now I ask, For what reason have you sent for me?"

30. Cornelius said, "Four days ago, at this hour, I was offering the three o'clock prayer in my house, when suddenly a man stood before me in shining dress

31. and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your gifts of charity have been remembered before God.

32. Send to Joppa and call for Simon who is surnamed Peter. He is a guest in the house of Simon a tanner near the sea'

33. Immediately I sent to you and you have done well in coming. Now here we all are in God's presence to hear all that the Lord has commanded you."

34. Peter opened his mouth and said, "Truly I understand that God is not partial,

35. but in every nation whoever reverences him and lives righteously is acceptable to him.

36. As to the message which he sent to the children of Israel telling the good news of peace through Jesus Christ \'97 who is Lord of all \'97

37. you know the story that spread through all Judaea. It began in Galilee after the baptism which John proclaimed.

38. You know of Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were harassed by the Devil, for God was with him.

39. We are witnesses of all that he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They hung him on a cross and so killed him.

40. But God raised him up on the third day and granted that he should become visible,

41. not to all the people, but to witnesses previously chosen by God, namely, to us who ate and drank with him after his resurrection from the dead.

42. God commanded us to proclaim to the people and to testify that he is the divinely appointed Judge of the living and the dead.

43. All of the prophets testify to this, that every one who believes in him obtains forgiveness of sins through his name."

44. While Peter was speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to his message.

45. All the believers who were of the circumcision who had come along with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out on the Gentiles,

46. for they heard them speaking with tongues and glorifying God. Then Peter said,

47. "Can any one forbid water for the baptism of these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did?"

48. And he directed that they should be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain there a few days.

## Acts 11

1. THE apostles and the brethren throughout Judaea heard that the Gentiles also had received the message of God.

2. When Peter went up to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision criticized him,

3. saying, "You went into the houses of uncircumcised men and ate with them."

4. But Peter began and explained consecutively all that had happened. He said,

5. "I was in the city of Joppa and was praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. Something like a great sheet was descending, lowered from heaven by the four corners, and it came to where I was.

6. I looked at it attentively and saw the fourfooted animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the reptiles and the birds of the air.

7. Then I heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter, kill and eat.'

8. I said, 'By no means, Lord, for never has anything common or unclean entered my mouth.'

9. The voice spoke again from heaven, 'What God has cleansed you must not think common.'

10. This happened three times and then everything was drawn up again into heaven.

11. Immediately three men came to the house in which we were. They had been sent from Caesarea to me.

12. The Spirit directed me to go with them without any questioning. These six brethren also went with me, and we entered the man's house.

13. He related to us how he had seen in his house an angel who stood and said, 'Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.

14. He will speak to you words by which you and your whole household will be saved.'

15. When I began speaking the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as on us at the beginning,

16. and I remembered the words of the Lord how he said, 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'

17. If then God gave to them the same gift that he gave to us on believing in the Lord Jesus, who was I that I could oppose God?"

18. On hearing this they ceased their criticism and gave glory to God, saying, "Then even to the Gentiles God has granted the change of heart that leads to life."

19. Those who were scattered abroad by the persecution that arose in connection with Stephen went as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, telling the message to none but Jews.

20. Some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, and they on reaching Antioch spoke also to the Greeks, telling them the good news of the Lord Jesus.

21. The hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number believed and turned to the Lord.

22. Word came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem regarding these men, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.

23. When he arrived and saw the grace of God he was delighted, and he encouraged all to be firmly faithful to the Lord.

24. For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. A considerable number were added to the Lord.

25. Barnabas went away to Tarsus to look up Saul,

26. and upon finding him he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a large company, and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called "Christians."

27. In those days some prophets went down from Jerusalem to Antioch.

28. One of them named Agabus arose and foretold through the Holy Spirit that a great famine was going to occur over all the inhabited world. 

29. Then the disciples determined, each according to his means, to send something for the help of the brethren who were living in Judaea.

30. This they did, sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.

## Acts 12

1. ABOUT that time King Herod laid hands on some members of the church in order to maltreat them.

2. He killed James the brother of John with the sword.

3. Seeing that it was pleasing to the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the Days of Unleavened Bread.

4. He seized him and put him in prison, committing him to four guards of four soldiers each for safe keeping, intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.

5. So Peter was under guard in the prison. But prayer was continually made by the church to God for him.

6. On the very night before Herod was going to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains, and guards before the door were watching the prison.

7. Suddenly an angel of the Lord was there. Light shone in the cell. Striking Peter's side he woke him, saying, "Rise up quickly." His chains fell off his hands.

8. The angel said to him, "Put on your belt and your sandals." Peter did so. The angel said to him, "Throw your cloak around you and follow me."

9. Peter came out and followed along, not knowing whether what the angel was doing was real. He thought he was seeing a vision.

10. After passing the first guard and the second, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city. This opened for them of its own accord and they went out and went along one street. Then suddenly the angel left him.

11. When Peter came to himself, he said, "Now I know truly that the Lord has sent his angel and has delivered me out of the hands of Herod, and from all the expectation of the Jewish people."

12. So understanding the situation, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John called Mark, where a number were assembled and were praying.

13. When Peter knocked at the door of the entry, a girl named Rhoda came to listen,

14. and when she recognized Peter's voice, without opening the door, she ran for joy and told them that Peter was standing at the door.

15. They said to her, "You are insane." But she was positive that it was so. They said, "It is his angel."

16. Peter continued knocking. When they opened the door and saw him they were amazed.

17. He motioned to them with his hand to be silent, and explained to them how the Lord had delivered him out of the prison, and he said, "Tell this to James and the brethren." Then he left and went to a different place.

18. When day came there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter.

19. Herod searched for him, but not finding him he closely questioned the guards and ordered them to be led away to execution. Then he went down from Jerusalem to Caesarea and stayed there.

20. Herod had a bitter feud with the Tyrians and Sidonians. But they came to him with one mind, and having won over Blastus, the King's chamberlain, they begged for peace, because their country depended for its food supply on the King's country.

21. On an appointed day Herod in his royal robes sat on a platform and made an address to them.

22. The people shouted, "It is a god's voice, not a man's."

23. Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give the glory to God, and he was eaten by worms and expired.

24. But God's message grew and spread.

25. Barnabas and Saul after fulfilling their mission returned from Jerusalem, bringing along with them John, surnamed Mark.

## Acts 13

1. THERE were in Antioch among the members of the church several prophets and teachers \'97 Barnabas, and Symeon, who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene and Manaen 

2. As they were serving the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."

3. Then, after fasting and praying and laying their hands upon them, they sent them off.

4. Sent out in this way by the Holy Spirit, Barnabas and Saul went down to Seleucia and from there sailed for Cyprus.

5. Arriving at Salamis they announced God's message in the synagogues of the Jews. They had John as their assistant.

6. After passing through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came across a Jewish magician and false prophet, named Bar-Jesus,

7. who was in the company of the Proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. The Proconsul invited in Barnabas and Saul and desired to hear God's message.

8. But Elymas the magician 

9. But Saul 

10. and said, "You who are full of every kind of fraud, you son of the Devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you never stop perverting the straight paths of the Lord?

11. And now the hand of the Lord is upon you and you will be blind for a time, unable to see the sun." Immediately a dimness and darkness fell on him, and he went about seeking for people to lead him by the hand.

12. Then the Proconsul, seeing what had happened, believed, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.

13. Sailing away from Paphos, Paul and his companions came to Perga in Pamphylia. John left them there and returned to Jerusalem.

14. But they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. On the Sabbath they went into the synagogue and sat down.

15. After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue directors sent to them saying, "Brethren, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, speak it."

16. Paul rose and motioning with his hand said, "Israelites and you who reverence God, listen.

17. The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their sojourn in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm brought them out.

18. For a period of about forty years he fed them in the wilderness,

19. and after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan he gave them their land as an inheritance for about four hundred and fifty years.

20. After that he gave them judges down to the prophet Samuel.

21. Next they asked for a king and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.

22. After removing him, God raised up David to be their king, to whom he bore testimony, 'I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart. He will carry out all my purposes.'

23. "Of this man's descendants God, according to his promise, brought to Israel a savior \'97 Jesus,

24. before whose coming John had proclaimed to all the people of Israel baptism for a change of heart.

25. As John was finishing his career he used to say, 'What do you think that I am? I am not he. But one is coming after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to unfasten.'

26. "Brethren, sons of Abraham's race and those among you who reverence God, the message of this salvation has been sent to you.

27. For the inhabitants of Jerusalem and their rulers, neither understanding him nor the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled those utterances by condemning him.

28. Although they found no ground for putting him to death they begged Pilate to have him killed.

29. When they had completely done all that had been predicted about him, they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb.

30. But God raised him from the dead

31. and he appeared for many days to those who had gone up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to all the people.

32. "We tell you the good news that the promise to our fathers has been kept;

33. for God has fulfilled it for our children in raising up Jesus, as it is written in the second psalm, 'Thou art my son; to-day I have become thy father.'

34. And as to his raising him from the dead, never to return to decay, he spoke thus; 'I will give you the holy and sure promises made to David.'

35. Therefore he says also in another psalm, 'Thou wilt not let thy holy one see decay.'

36. For David after serving the will of God in his own generation fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw decay.

37. But he whom God raised up saw no decay.

38. "Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.

39. Yes, every one who believes in him is cleared from all the sins from which you could not be cleared by the Law of Moses.

40. Take care then that what was said in the Prophets does not come on you,

41. 'See, you disdainful ones, and wonder and perish; for I am working a work in your days \'97 a work which you will not believe even if some one fully explains it to you.' "

42. As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people begged that these words might be spoken to them on the next Sabbath.

43. After the synagogue was dismissed, many of the Jews and of the pious converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked to them and endeavored to persuade them to hold fast to the grace of God.

44. On the next Sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the message of God.

45. But the Jews, seeing the crowds, were filled with anger and kept speaking in abusive language against what was said by Paul.

46. Then Paul and Barnabas said with fearless plainness, "The message of God had to be spoken first to you. But since you thrust it away and do not judge yourselves worthy of life eternal \'97 now, we turn to the Gentiles.

47. For so the Lord has commanded us, 'I have set you for a light of the Gentiles, that you may be for salvation to the ends of the earth.'

48. When the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and glorified the message of the Lord, and all who were predestined to life eternal believed.

49. The message of the Lord was carried abroad through the whole country.

50. But the Jews stirred up the pious women of high standing and the leading men of the city, and started a persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them from their boundaries.

51. They shook off the dust of their feet as a protest against them, and came to Iconium.

52. The disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.

## Acts 14

1. IN Iconium Paul and Barnabas went in the same way into the synagogue and spoke so that a large number both of Jews and of Greeks believed.

2. But the unbelieving Jews excited and embittered the minds of the Gentiles against the brethren.

3. Therefore the apostles spent considerable time speaking freely and fearlessly in reliance upon the Lord, who bore witness to his gracious message by permitting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.

4. The people of the city became divided; some were with the Jews and some with the apostles.

5. But when there was a rush made by the Gentiles and the Jews, along with their rulers, to hustle them and stone them,

6. the apostles learned of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding country,

7. and there they went on telling the good news.

8. In Lystra there was a man sitting who was powerless in his feet. He had been lame from his mother's womb and never had walked.

9. He was listening to Paul as he was speaking. Paul fixed his eyes on him, and, seeing that he had faith to be healed,

10. said in a loud voice, "Stand up straight on your feet." He sprang up and walked about.

11. When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices, saying in Lycaonian, "The gods have taken human form and come down to us."

12. They called Barnabas Zeus and Paul Hermes, because he was the principal speaker.

13. Then the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of the city, brought bulls and garlands to the gates, followed by the crowds, and intended to offer sacrifice.

14. But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they rent their garments and sprang into the crowd, crying out,

15. "Men, why are you doing this? We too are men with the same weaknesses that you have. We are bringing you the good news that you are to turn from these foolish things to the living God, who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and all things that are in them.

16. In past generations he permitted all the nations to go their own ways,

17. though he did not leave himself without evidence, for he did you good and gave rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness."

18. Even by saying this they with difficulty kept the crowds from offering sacrifice to them.

19. But Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium and won over the crowds, and they stoned Paul and dragged him outside of the city, thinking that he was dead.

20. But when the disciples gathered around him he rose up and reentered the city. On the next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe.

21. Telling the good news in that city they made a number of disciples. Then they returned to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch,

22. reassuring the minds of the disciples and encouraging them to be steadfast in the faith, saying, "Through many trials we must enter into the kingdom of God."

23. They appointed elders for them in every church, and after prayer and fasting committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.

24. They passed through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia.

25. After telling the message in Perga, they came down to Attalia.

26. From there they sailed for Antioch, where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had now completed.

27. Upon their arrival they assembled the church and narrated all that God, working with them, had done, and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.

28. There they passed no little time with the disciples.

## Acts 15

1. BUT certain men came down from Judaea and undertook to teach the brethren, "Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."

2. Since no little dissension and controversy arose between Paul and Barnabas and these men, it was arranged that Paul and Barnabas and some others of them should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.

3. So they were sent on by the church and passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, relating the conversion of the Gentiles, which caused great joy to all the brethren.

4. On their arrival in Jerusalem they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they narrated all that God, working with them, had done.

5. Then some of the party of the Pharisees, who had become believers, rose and said, "We must circumcise them and tell them to keep the Law of Moses."

6. The apostles and elders met to confer about this matter.

7. After there had been much debate, Peter rose and said to them, "Brethren, you know that in early days God chose among you that through my mouth the Gentiles should hear the message of good news and should believe.

8. And God, who knows all hearts, bore witness to them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us.

9. He made no difference between us and them in cleansing their hearts by faith.

10. Now, therefore, why are you testing God by putting on the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?

11. On the contrary we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus just as they are."

12. The whole assembly remained silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul relating all the signs and wonders that God had done through them among the Gentiles.

13. When they ceased speaking, James said, "Brethren, listen to me.

14. Symeon has told how first God graciously visited the Gentiles and took a people for his name.

15. With this the words of the prophets agree, as it is written,

16. 'After this I will return and build up again the tent of David which has fallen down; yes, I will build up its ruins and erect it again,

17. that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles upon whom my name has been bestowed, says the Lord

18. who does these things foreknown from of old.'

19. Therefore I judge best not to trouble those of the Gentiles who have turned to God,

20. but to write to them to abstain from contamination with idols, and from unchastity, and from what has been strangled, and from blood.

21. For Moses has had for generations past in every city those who preach him, for he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath."

22. Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to select men from themselves and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, men esteemed among the brethren.

23. They wrote and sent by their hands the following letter: "The Apostles and the Brethren who are elders, to the Brethren from the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia: Greeting.

24. "Inasmuch as we have heard that certain persons from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your minds, \'97 men whom we did not authorize, \'97

25. it seemed good, after unanimous agreement, to select some men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,

26. who have exposed their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

27. We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who will tell you orally the same things.

28. For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no further burden than these necessary things:

29. to abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from strangled things, and from unchastity. If you keep yourselves from these you will do well. Farewell."

30. So they were sent away and went down to Antioch, where they called together the whole body and delivered over the letter.

31. On reading it they rejoiced over the encouragement.

32. Both Judas and Silas, being themselves prophets, encouraged and confirmed the brethren by long addresses.

33. After spending some time they were sent away with a message of peace from the brethren to those who had sent them.

34. TEXT OMITTED

35. Paul and Barnabas stayed on in Antioch teaching and telling, in association with many others, the good news of the Lord's message.

36. After some time Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us go back and visit the brethren in every city in which we made known the Lord's message, and see how they are prospering."

37. Barnabas wished to take along John who was called Mark.

38. But Paul did not approve of taking him along, since he had left them in Pamphylia and had not gone on with them into the work.

39. Such a difference of feeling resulted that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark and sailed away to Cyprus.

40. Paul selected Silas and left, after being commended to the grace of the Lord by the brethren.

41. They went through Syria and Cilicia strengthening the churches.

## Acts 16

1. THEY came to Derbe and Lystra. At Lystra there was a disciple named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman, who was a believer, and of a Greek father.

2. He had a good reputation among the brethren in Lystra and Iconium.

3. Paul wished to have Timothy go with him. So he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts. For they all knew that his father was a Greek.

4. Thus they traveled through the cities and delivered to the disciples for observance the rules that had been decided on by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.

5. So the churches grew firmer in faith and increased in numbers from day to day.

6. They went through Phrygia and the Galatian country, the Holy Spirit having prevented their speaking the message in Asia.

7. Upon reaching Mysia they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the spirit of Jesus did not allow them.

8. Passing by Mysia they came down to Troas.

9. There a vision appeared to Paul in the night \'97 a Macedonian man was standing and begging him saying, "Come over into Macedonia and help us."

10. After Paul had seen the vision, we at once tried to go out to Macedonia, inferring that God had called on us to tell the good news to the people there.

11. Sailing away from Troas we made a straight run to Samothrace, and on the next day to Neapolis.

12. From there we went to Philippi, which is the first city of that part of Macedonia and is a Roman colony. We remained in that city for a number of days.

13. On the Sabbath day we went outside of the gate to a place on the riverside where it was customary to go for prayer, and we sat down and talked with the women who had gathered there.

14. One woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple, from the city of Thyatira, who reverenced God, was listening. God opened her heart to receive what was said by Paul.

15. When she had been baptized along with her household, she begged us, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay," and she insisted on our doing so.

16. It so happened that as we were going to the place of prayer a certain slave girl who had a spirit of divination met us. She was bringing great gain to her masters by divining.

17. She followed Paul and us and kept calling out, "These men are servants of God Most High, and they are teaching you the way of salvation."

18. This she kept doing for many days. Paul was annoyed, and turning he said to the spirit, "I tell you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her," and it came out at that very moment.

19. When her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold of Paul and Silas and dragged them into the public square before the authorities.

20. Bringing them in, they said to the magistrates, "These men, who are Jews, are disturbing our city

21. and teaching customs which it is not proper for us, who are Romans, to receive or practice."

22. The crowd joined in the attack upon them, and the magistrates tore off their clothes and ordered them to be beaten with rods.

23. After laying many stripes upon them they cast them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them securely.

24. He on receiving such an order thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet secure in the stocks.

25. But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening.

26. Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. Immediately all the doors were opened and every one's fetters were loosed.

27. The jailer, waking from sleep and seeing the doors of the prison open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had escaped.

28. But Paul said with a loud voice, "Do no harm to yourself, for we are all here."

29. Calling for a light he sprang in and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas,

30. and led them out and said, "Men, what must I do to be saved?"

31. They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, and your household,"

32. and they told the message of God to him and to all who were in his house.

33. He took them at that hour of the night and washed their stripes. Then he was baptized, he and all of his household, immediately.

34. He brought them into his house and spread the table for them, and rejoiced with his whole family because he had believed in God.

35. When morning came the magistrates sent their orderlies to say, "Set those men at liberty."

36. The jailer told this order to Paul, "The magistrates have sent to have you set at liberty. Now go out and proceed on your journey in peace."

37. But Paul said to them, "After beating us publicly and without a trial, although we are Romans, they cast us into prison. And are they now sending us out secretly? No, let them come themselves and lead us out."

38. The orderlies reported these words to the magistrates. When they heard that they were Romans they were alarmed,

39. and came and begged them, and after leading them out requested them to leave the city.

40. They came out of the prison and went into Lydia's house, and after seeing and encouraging the brethren they departed.

## Acts 17

1. AFTER passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia they came to Thessalonica. Here there was a synagogue of the Jews.

2. According to Paul's custom he went in to meet with them, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,

3. explaining and showing that it was necessary that the Christ should suffer and rise from the dead, and saying, "Jesus of whom I am telling you is the Christ."

4. Some of them were persuaded and attached themselves to Paul and Silas \'97 a large number of the pious Greeks and not a few of the leading women.

5. But the Jews became excited and, taking with them some of the base loafers from the market-place, they made a mob and threw the city into confusion. They attacked the house of Jason and tried to bring Paul and Silas out to the people.

6. Not finding them, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the magistrates, shouting, "These men who have upset the world have now come here.

7. Jason has received them. They all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is a different king \'97 Jesus."

8. Both the crowd and the magistrates were disturbed on hearing this.

9. So they took security from Jason and the rest and then dismissed them.

10. The brethren immediately sent off Paul and Silas in the night to Beraea. They on arrival went into the synagogue of the Jews.

11. These people were nobler than those in Thessalonica. They welcomed the message with all readiness and examined the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.

12. Consequently many of them believed, and also not a few Greeks; women of high standing and men.

13. When the Jews of Thessalonica learned that God's message had been proclaimed by Paul also in Beraea, they came there agitating and disturbing the crowds.

14. At once then the brethren sent away Paul to go down to the sea coast. Silas and Timothy remained there.

15. Those who were conducting Paul took him as far as Athens, and, after receiving a letter to Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they left.

16. While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was stirred within him as he looked upon the city full of idols.

17. He often debated in the synagogue with the Jews and pious persons, and in the market-place every day with whoever happened to be there.

18. Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him, and some said, "What can this idle talker mean?" Others said, "He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods," because he was telling the good news of Jesus and the resurrection.

19. They took him and led him up on to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know what this new doctrine that you are speaking of is?

20. For you are bringing strange and surprising things to our ears. We wish to know what these things are."

21. For all the Athenians and the foreigners residing there spent their time in nothing else than in telling or hearing something newer than the last.

22. Paul took his stand in the midst of the Areopagus and said: "Men of Athens, I see that you are in every way unusually reverential to the gods.

23. For in passing about and contemplating your sacred objects I came upon an altar on which was inscribed, 'To an unknown God.' What you are worshiping in ignorance \'97 that I am making known to you.

24. "The God who made the world and all the things that are in it, he who is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made by hands,

25. nor is he served by human hands, as if he needed anything. For he gives to all life and breath and all things.

26. And he made of one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having marked out the appointed times and the boundaries of their abodes,

27. that they might seek for God, if they could feel after him and find him, though, indeed, he is not far from each one of us.

28. For in him we live and move and are; as some of your own poets have said, 'For we also are his offspring.'

29. Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that deity is like gold or silver or stone, a thing carved by man's art and thought.

30. The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all men everywhere to change,

31. since he has set a day in which he will soon judge the world in justice by the man whom he has appointed, and of whom he has given evidence to all men by raising him from the dead."

32. When they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some sneered; others said, "We will hear you again about this."

33. So Paul went out from the midst of them.

34. But certain men attached themselves to him and believed. Among them was Dionysius the Areopagite, and there was a woman named Damaris and several other persons.

## Acts 18

1. AFTER this Paul left Athens and came to Corinth.

2. There he found a Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus but recently come from Italy with Priscilla his wife, because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Paul visited these people,

3. and because he was of the same trade stayed with them and they worked together; for by trade they were tent-makers.

4. But in the synagogue every Sabbath he reasoned and endeavored to persuade both Jews and Greeks.

5. When Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was absorbed by the message, bearing witness to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.

6. When they resisted and spoke profane words, he rent his garments and said to them, "Your blood is on your own heads. I am clear, and from now on I am going to the Gentiles."

7. So he changed over from there and came into the house of a man named Titus Justus, who reverenced God. His house was next to the synagogue.

8. Crispus, the synagogue Director, believed in the Lord with all his household, and many of the Corinthians when they heard believed and were baptized.

9. The Lord spoke in the night by a vision to Paul, "Do not fear, but speak and be not silent,

10. for I am with you and no one shall attack and harm you, for I have many people in this city."

11. So he stayed a year and six months, teaching among them the message of God.

12. While Gallio was Proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one mind made an attack on Paul and brought him before the court,

13. saying, "This man is inducing men to worship God in a way contrary to law."

14. As Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it was some crime or wicked knavery, O you Jews, I would have reasonable patience with you.

15. But if it is a dispute about doctrine and names and your own law, see to it yourselves. I will not be a judge of these things,"

16. and he drove them from before the judge's seat.

17. Then they laid hold of Sosthenes, the synagogue Director, and beat him right in front of the judge's seat. But Gallio cared for none of these things.

18. Paul remained a number of days more. Then after taking leave of the brethren he sailed away to Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila went with him. He had shaved his head at Cenchreae, for he had a vow.

19. They came to Ephesus and Paul left his companions there. He himself went into the synagogue and debated with the Jews.

20. Although they begged him to stay longer, he did not consent,

21. but took his leave, saying, "I will return to you again, God willing."

22. From Ephesus he put to sea and came to Caesarea. Then he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church, and from there returned to Antioch.

23. After spending some time there he set out and went through the Galatian country and Phrygia, place by place, strengthening all the disciples.

24. A certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, a learned man, had come to Ephesus.

25. He was strong in knowledge of the Scriptures and had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and, being very earnest in spirit, was teaching accurately about Jesus, although he knew no baptism but John's.

26. This man began to speak fearlessly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him and explained to him the way of God more accurately still.

27. As he wished to cross over to Achaia, the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. So he went and greatly helped those who had believed through grace.

28. For he powerfully and publicly refuted the Jews, showing from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.

## Acts 19

1. WHILE Apollos was in Corinth, Paul, after passing through the upper country, came to Ephesus and found certain disciples.

2. He said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" They said to him, "On the contrary, we did not even hear that there was a Holy Spirit."

3. He said, "How then were you baptized?" They said, "With John's baptism."

4. Paul said, "John baptized with the baptism of a change of heart, telling the people to believe in one who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus."

5. On hearing that, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus,

6. and when Paul laid his hands on them the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.

7. There were about twelve of these men in all.

8. For three months Paul went into the synagogue and spoke fearlessly, arguing persuasively regarding the kingdom of God.

9. When some were hardened and would not believe and spoke evil of the Way before the congregation, he departed from them and took away his disciples and discussed daily in the lecture-hall of Tyrannus.

10. This went on for two years, so that all the inhabitants of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the message of the Lord.

11. Through the hands of Paul, God did miracles of no ordinary kind,

12. so that handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched his body were carried to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits departed.

13. Then some of the wandering Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke over those who had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, "I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul proclaims."

14. There were seven sons of a certain Sceva, a Jewish high priest, who did this.

15. But the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know and Paul I know; but who are you?"

16. and the man in whom the evil spirit was sprang on them and overpowered both of them, and so belabored them that they fled from that house naked and wounded.

17. This became known to all who were living in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks, and awe fell on all of them, and the name of the Lord Jesus came to be held in high honor.

18. Many of those who had become believers came confessing and telling of their practices.

19. A number of those who had practiced magic brought their books and burned them before all. Adding up the prices of them they found the total to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.

20. Thus vigorously the Lord's message grew and strengthened.

21. When these things had been accomplished Paul took it in mind to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem, saying, "After I have been there I must see Rome also."

22. He sent on into Macedonia two of his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself remained awhile in Asia.

23. At that time there arose no small commotion about the Way.

24. For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, a maker of silver shrines of Artemis, was bringing to the artisans no small gain.

25. He gathered these and the workmen employed about such things and said, "Men, you know that from this business we get our wealth,

26. and you see and hear that not only at Ephesus, but also throughout almost all Asia this Paul has persuaded and drawn away a large number, saying that hand-made gods are not gods at all.

27. Not only is this trade of ours in danger of coming into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis is in danger of being held of no account, and she whom now all Asia and the wide world worship will be deposed from her majesty."

28. Upon hearing this, they became full of anger and shouted, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"

29. The city was filled with confusion, and the people rushed with one mind into the theater, having gotten hold of Gaius and Aristarchus, fellow travelers of Paul's.

30. When Paul wished to go in and face the people the disciples would not let him.

31. Some of the city officials who were his friends sent to him and begged him not to expose himself in the theater.

32. Some were shouting one thing and some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and the most did not know why they had come together.

33. Some of the crowd fixed on Alexander, since the Jews were putting him forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand and wished to make a defense before the people.

34. But when they recognized that he was a Jew, there arose one shout from all for about two hours, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"

35. Then the City Clerk quieted the crowd and said, "Men of Ephesus, who is there of all men who does not know that the city of Ephesus is the temple-keeper of the great Artemis, and of her image which fell down from Zeus?

36. Since these things are indisputable, you ought to be calm and do nothing rash.

37. For you have brought here these men who are not robbers of temples nor defamers of your goddess.

38. If Demetrius and the artisans with him have a charge against any one, there are court days and there are proconsuls; let the parties state their cases.

39. If you are seeking anything further, it shall be settled in a lawful assembly.

40. For we are in danger of being called in question regarding to-day's mob, and we shall not be able to give a reason for this tumult."

41. By saying this he dissolved the gathering.

## Acts 20

1. WHEN the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and, after encouraging them, he bade them farewell and left to proceed to Macedonia.

2. Passing through those parts and encouraging them by many addresses, he came into Greece.

3. There he spent three months. When a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.

4. There were in company with him Sopater of Beraea, the son of Pyrrhus, and of the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy, and from Asia Tychicus and Trophimus.

5. These went on and were waiting for us in Troas.

6. After the Days of Unleavened Bread we sailed from Philippi and came to them in Troas in five days. There we spent seven days.

7. On the first day of the week, when we all were assembled to break bread, Paul was discoursing to them, being about to leave in the morning, and he extended his address until midnight.

8. There were many lamps in the upper room where we were assembled.

9. A certain young man named Eutychus, sitting in a window, was overcome with deep sleep while Paul went on discoursing. At last overpowered by sleep he fell from the third story and was taken up dead.

10. But Paul went down and threw himself on him and embraced him and said, "Do not make a noisy wailing; for his life is still in him."

11. Then he went up and broke bread and ate and talked on till daybreak and so departed.

12. They brought the boy living, and were not a little comforted.

13. We went in advance to the ship and sailed for Assos, intending to take on Paul there, for so he had arranged, intending to come himself by land.

14. So when he joined us at Assos, we took him aboard and came to Mitylene.

15. From there we sailed next day and arrived off Chios. The next day we came to Samos, and on the following day to Miletus.

16. For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus in order not to spend time in Asia. He was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, on the Day of Pentecost.

17. From Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church.

18. When they came to him, he said to them, "You know how I have lived among you the whole time since the first day I set foot in Asia,

19. serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that befell me through the plots of the Jews \'97

20. how I did not shrink from telling you anything that was profitable or from teaching you publicly and from house to house,

21. urging upon both Jews and Greeks the need of a change of heart toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus.

22. "And now I am on my way, bound in spirit, to Jerusalem, not knowing what is to befall me there,

23. except that the Holy Spirit testifies from city to city that chains and trials are waiting for me.

24. But I do not hold my life as of any account if only I may finish my race and the service which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the good news of the grace of God.

25. And now I know that you all, among whom I have gone about heralding the kingdom, will never see my face again.

26. Therefore I testify to you to-day that I am clear of the blood of all.

27. For I did not shrink from telling you the whole purpose of God.

28. "Be watchful of yourselves and of all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers. Shepherd the church of God which he bought with his own blood.

29. I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come among you, not sparing the flock.

30. And from among yourselves men will arise speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after themselves.

31. Therefore watch, remembering that for three years I never ceased night nor day to exhort each one of you with tears.

32. "And now I commit you to the Lord and to his gracious message, which can build you up and give you the heritage among all those who have been made holy.

33. I have coveted no man's silver or gold or apparel.

34. You yourselves know that these hands provided for my needs and the needs of my companions.

35. In all things I showed you that so laboring we ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'

36. After saying this he kneeled with them all and prayed.

37. All wept aloud, and falling on Paul's neck they kissed him affectionately,

38. grieving especially because he had said that they would never see his face again; and they escorted him to the ship.

## Acts 21

1. WHEN we had torn ourselves away from them and had sailed, we made a straight run to Cos, then on the next day to Rhodes and from there to Patara.

2. There finding a ship crossing to Phoenicia we went on board and sailed.

3. After sighting Cyprus and leaving it on the left, we sailed on to Syria and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to discharge her cargo.

4. We looked up the disciples and stayed with them seven days. They repeatedly told Paul through the Holy Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem.

5. But when we had finished the days, we left and continued our journey, and they all with their wives and children escorted us until we got outside of the city. Then, after kneeling down on the beach and praying,

6. we tore ourselves from one another; we went aboard the ship and they went back to their homes.

7. We made the voyage from Tyre and arrived at Ptolemais. There we greeted the brethren and remained one day with them.

8. On the next day we left and came to Caesarea, and entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the Seven, and we stayed with him.

9. Philip had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy.

10. During our stay of many days a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Jerusalem.

11. He came to see us, and took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands and said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit, 'So will the Jews in Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt, and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.' "

12. When we heard this, both we and the residents there begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.

13. Paul answered, "What are you accomplishing by weeping and breaking my heart? For I hold myself ready not only to be bound, but to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."

14. When he would not be persuaded, we stopped talking, saying, "The Lord's will be done."

15. At the end of these days we packed up and went up to Jerusalem.

16. Some of the disciples from Caesarea went up with us, taking along Mnason, a Cypriote, an old-time disciple, whose guests we were to be.

17. When we reached Jerusalem, the brethren welcomed us cordially.

18. On the next day, Paul went in with us for an interview with James, and all the elders came.

19. After saluting them, he related in detail all that God had done among the Gentiles through his service.

20. After hearing him, they gave glory to God and said to Paul, "You see, brother, how many tens of thousands of believers there are among the Jews, and they are all zealous for the Law.

21. These have heard reports that you are teaching all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to break away from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children and not to observe the customs.

22. What then? It will be generally heard that you have come.

23. So do this that we tell you. There are among us four men who are under a vow.

24. Take these men and go through purification with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Then all will know that what they have heard about you amounts to nothing, but that you yourself walk in obedience to the Law.

25. "But as to the Gentiles that have believed, we have, after consideration, sent our decision that they shall guard themselves against what has been sacrificed to idols, and against blood, and against what has been strangled, and against unchastity."

26. Then Paul on the next day took the men, and, after purifying himself, entered the Temple courts, giving notice of the completion of the days of purification \'97 the time until a sacrifice would have been offered for each one of them.

27. But when the seven days were nearly completed, the Jews from Asia saw him in the Temple courts, and stirred up all the crowd and laid their hands on Paul,

28. shouting, "Men of Israel, help. This is the man who teaches everybody everywhere against our people and the Law and this place, and moreover, he has brought Greeks into the Temple courts and has desecrated this holy place."

29. For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul, and they thought that he had brought him into the Temple courts.

30. The whole city was excited and the people rushed together. Seizing Paul, they drew him out of the Temple courts, and immediately the gates were closed.

31. As they were trying to kill him, word went up to the Tribune of the battalion that all Jerusalem was in commotion.

32. He at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to the people. They, on seeing the Tribune and the soldiers, stopped beating Paul.

33. Then the Tribune coming up arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was and what he had done.

34. Some called out one thing and some another in the crowd. Not being able to find out anything for certain on account of the confusion, he ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks.

35. When Paul got upon the stairs, it so happened that he was being carried by the soldiers on account of the violence of the mob.

36. For the crowd of people was following and shouting, "Kill him!"

37. As he was about to enter the barracks Paul said to the Tribune, "May I say something to you?" He replied, "Can you speak Greek?

38. Are you then not the Egyptian who some time ago raised a sedition and led off four thousand assassins into the desert?"

39. Paul said, "I am a Jew from Tarsus, in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I beg you to let me talk to the people."

40. He gave him leave, and Paul standing on the stairs motioned with his hand to the people. There was a great silence, and, speaking loudly in Hebrew, Paul said:

## Acts 22

1. "BRETHREN and Fathers, listen to the defense I now make to you."

2. Hearing him speaking to them in the Hebrew language, they kept all the more quiet. He continued:

3. "I am a Jew, born in Tarsus, in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel in exact knowledge of our ancestral Law, and I was zealous for God as you all are to-day.

4. I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prison both men and women,

5. as the High Priest and all the eldership can testify for me. From them I received letters to the brethren and was journeying to Damascus in order to bring back in chains to Jerusalem for punishment those who had gone there.

6. It happened that as I was journeying and nearing Damascus, about noon, suddenly a great light flashed from heaven around me.

7. I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'

8. I asked, 'Who is speaking?' He said to me, 'I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.'

9. My companions saw the light, but did not hear the voice of him who spoke to me.

10. I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' The Lord said to me, 'Rise and go into Damascus, and there you will be told about all that it has been appointed for you to do.'

11. Since I could not see, owing to the brightness of that light, my companions led me by the hand, and so I entered Damascus.

12. "Then a man named Ananias, a strict observer of the Law and highly esteemed by all the Jews who lived there,

13. came to see me and stood by me and said, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight,' and I, at that moment, could see him.

14. He said, 'The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One and to hear the voice from his mouth,

15. for you shall be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard.

16. And now why delay? Rise, be baptized and wash away your sins, calling upon his name.'

17. "After I had returned to Jerusalem, and was praying in the Temple courts, I fell into a trance

18. and saw Jesus saying to me, 'Hasten and depart quickly from Jerusalem, for they will not receive your testimony concerning me.'

19. But I said, 'Lord, they know that I used to imprison and beat from synagogue to synagogue those who believe in thee,

20. and when the blood of Stephen thy martyr was shed I myself was standing by and approving it, and taking care of the cloaks of those who were putting him to death.'

21. But he said to me, 'Go, for I will send you far away to Gentiles.'

22. They listened up to this point, but now they broke out, shouting, "Away with such a fellow from the earth! He ought never to have lived!"

23. While they were shouting and rending their garments and throwing dust into the air,

24. the Tribune ordered him to be led into the barracks and directed that he should be examined with the lash, so that he might know for what crime they were shouting so against him.

25. When they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said to the Centurion who was standing by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and without a trial?"

26. On hearing that, the Centurion went to the Tribune and told him," What are you going to do? For this man is a Roman."

27. Then the Tribune came to him and said, "Tell me; are you a Roman?" He said, "Yes."

28. The Tribune said, "I obtained this citizenship by paying a great sum of money." Paul said, "But I was born to it."

29. At once those who were about to examine him went away from him, and the Tribune was alarmed when he learned that he was a Roman, because he had chained him.

30. On the next day, wishing to know certainly why he was accused by the Jews, the Tribune loosed Paul and ordered the high priests and all the Council to assemble, and brought Paul down and stood him before them.

## Acts 23

1. PAUL fixed his eyes on the Council and said, "Brethren, I have conducted myself with all good conscience toward God up to this day."

2. The High Priest Ananias told those who stood near him to strike him on the mouth.

3. Then Paul said to him, "God will soon strike you, you whitewashed wall. Are you sitting to judge me by the Law and yet violating the Law by ordering me to be struck?"

4. Those who stood by said, "Are you insulting God's High Priest?"

5. Paul said, "I did not know, brethren, that he was High Priest. It is written, 'Thou shalt not speak evil of the Ruler of thy people.' "

6. Then Paul, perceiving that one party was of Sadducees and the other of Pharisees, shouted out in the Council, "Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. I am being tried for the hope of the resurrection of the dead."

7. On his saying this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly became divided.

8. For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection nor any angel or spirit, but the Pharisees confess both.

9. So a great uproar arose, and some of the scribes of the party of the Pharisees arose and contended, saying, "We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel?"

10. When the strife was becoming violent, the Tribune, fearing that Paul might be torn to pieces by them, ordered the soldiers to go down and take him from the midst of them and bring him into the barracks.

11. On the following night the Lord stood beside Paul and said, "Courage! As you have witnessed for me in Jerusalem, so you must witness in Rome."

12. When it was day, the Jews made a conspiracy and bound themselves by an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.

13. There were more than forty who had taken this oath.

14. They came to the high priests and elders and said, "We have bound ourselves by an oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.

15. Now therefore you and the Council must ask the Tribune to bring him down to you, as if you were going to inquire more exactly about him, and we, before he comes near, will be ready to put him out of the way."

16. But the son of Paul's sister heard of the ambush, and he came and entered the barracks and told Paul.

17. Paul called to him one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the Tribune, for he has something to tell him."

18. He took him and led him to the Tribune and said, "Paul, the prisoner, called me and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to say to you."

19. The Tribune took him by the hand and led him aside and asked, "What is it that you have to tell me?"

20. He said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to-morrow to the Council to inquire something more exactly about him.

21. But do not yield to them, for more than forty men of them are lying in ambush, and they have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him, and now they are ready, expecting a promise from you."

22. The Tribune dismissed the young man after charging him; "Tell no one that you have revealed this to me."

23. Then calling to him two of the centurions he said, "Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, at nine o'clock to-night."

24. They were to provide animals for Paul to ride and take him safely to Felix the Governor.

25. He wrote a letter in the following form:

26. "Claudius Lysias to his Excellency, Governor Felix: greeting.

27. This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I came up with soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.

28. Wishing to find what was the charge that they had against him I took him down to their Council.

29. I found him accused regarding disputed questions of their law, but of nothing deserving of death or of bonds.

30. Information has come to me that there will be a plot against the man, and so I am sending him at once to you, and I have commanded his accusers to state their case against him before you."

31. So the soldiers, according to their orders, took Paul and conducted him by night to Antipatris.

32. On the next day they let the horsemen go on with him, but they themselves returned to the barracks.

33. The horsemen came on to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the Governor, and also placed Paul before him.

34. He read the letter and asked of what province he was, and learned that he was from Cilicia.

35. Then he said, "I will hear what you have to say when your accusers also arrive." He gave orders that Paul should be guarded in Herod's castle.

## Acts 24

1. AFTER five days the High Priest Ananias came down with certain elders and an advocate named Tertullus, and they spoke against Paul to the Governor.

2. When Paul had been called in, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, "Because we enjoy great peace through your administration and reforms are taking place for this nation through your prudence,

3. we accept it always and everywhere, most excellent Felix, with all gratitude.

4. But not to burden you further, I beg you in your fairness to hear us briefly.

5. We have found this man a pest and an inciter of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a leader of the sect of the Nazarenes.

6. He even tried to desecrate the Temple courts, but we overpowered him.

7. TEXT OMITTED

8. You yourself can examine him and learn from him as to all these things of which we are accusing him."

9. The Jews joined in the attack upon him, affirming that these things were so.

10. Paul answered, when the Governor nodded to him to speak, "Because I know that for many years you have been a judge to this nation, I feel courage in defending myself.

11. You can ascertain that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.

12. Neither did they find me discussing with any one in the Temple courts nor making any tumultuous gatherings in the synagogues nor anywhere in the city,

13. nor can they bring you proofs of their accusations against me.

14. "This I do confess to you, that in the Way which they call a heresy I worship the God of our fathers, believing all things that are according to the Law and what is written in the Prophets

15. and having the hope in God which they themselves also accept \'97 that there will be a resurrection both of the just and of the unjust.

16. And in this I take pains, to have always a clear conscience toward God and toward men.

17. "After many years I came to my nation to make gifts of charity and offerings.

18. They found me in the Temple thus occupied and purified, with no crowd or noise \'97 but there were some Jews from Asia,

19. who ought to have been here before you to present their accusations if they had anything against me,

20. or let these themselves say what wrong they found in me when I stood before the Council;

21. unless it was in the single assertion that I shouted as I stood among them, 'It is regarding the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial to-day before you!' "

22. Felix adjourned the case, since he was well informed regarding the Way, saying, "When Lysias the Tribune comes down, I will inquire into your matters."

23. He gave orders to the Centurion to guard him, but to let him have indulgence, and not to hinder any of his friends from attending to his wants.

24. After some days Felix came with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him regarding faith in Christ Jesus.

25. While Paul was reasoning about righteousness and self-discipline and the judgment that is to come, Felix became alarmed and said," Go for the present. When I find a convenient time I will send for you."

26. At the same time he was in hopes that money would be given him by Paul and therefore he used to send for him more frequently and converse with him.

27. But at the end of two years Felix received Porcius Festus as a successor, and, wishing to do the Jews a favor, he left Paul in chains.

## Acts 25

1. FESTUS entered the province and after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.

2. There the high priests and the leaders of the Jews spoke to him against Paul

3. and begged as a favor that he would send for him to Jerusalem, intending to have an ambush and kill him on the road.

4. But Festus answered that Paul was being kept in Caesarea and that he himself was going back very soon.

5. "Let those of you who can," he said, "go down with me, and, if there is anything wrong about the man, let them bring their charges against him."

6. After spending not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea and on the next day took his seat on the judge's bench and ordered Paul to be brought in.

7. When he had come in, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him and brought many serious charges, which they were unable to prove,

8. while Paul claimed in his own defense, "Neither against the Jewish Law nor against the Temple courts nor against Caesar, have I committed any wrong."

9. Festus, wishing to gain favor with the Jews, asked Paul, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and there be tried for this before me?"

10. Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar's bar, where I ought to be tried. I have not harmed any Jews in anything, as you very well know.

11. If I am in the wrong and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not ask not to die. But if there is nothing in the accusations of these men, no one has the power to give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar."

12. Then Festus, after talking with his council, answered, "You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go."

13. When some days had passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice came to Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.

14. As they were spending a good many days there, Festus laid Paul's case before the King. "There is a man here," he said, "who was left a prisoner by Felix,

15. against whom when I was in Jerusalem the high priests and the elders of the Jews had much to say, asking to have him condemned.

16. I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any person for punishment before the accused has his accusers face to face and has opportunity for defense against the charge.

17. "So they came along down here and, without making any delay, on the very next day I took my seat on the judge's bench and ordered the man to be brought in.

18. When his accusers arose, they brought no charge of such crimes as I was expecting,

19. but they had some disputes with him about their own religion and concerning a certain Jesus who had died and whom Paul affirmed to be alive.

20. Being at a loss about a question of this kind, I asked if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried there on the charges.

21. But when Paul appealed to be kept for the examination of the Emperor, I ordered him to be kept until I could send him to Caesar."

22. Agrippa said to Festus, "I should like to hear the man myself." "To-morrow," he replied, "you shall hear him."

23. So on the next day Agrippa came and Bernice with much display, and they entered the auditorium with the military tribunes and the principal men of the city, and at Festus' command Paul was led in.

24. Festus said, "King Agrippa and all present here with us, you see this man against whom all the multitude of the Jews pleaded with me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying out that he ought not to live any longer.

25. But I understood that he had done nothing worthy of death, and when he himself had appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.

26. Concerning him I have nothing certain to write to my Lord. Therefore I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that after an examination I may have something to write.

27. For it seems to me unreasonable in sending a prisoner not to specify the charges against him."

## Acts 26

1. AGRIPPA said to Paul, "You are at liberty to speak for yourself." Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense:

2. "In regard to all of the things of which I am accused by Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate that I am to make my defense to-day before you,

3. since you are especially expert in all Jewish customs and questions. Therefore I pray you to hear me patiently.

4. "My life from boyhood, which was from the beginning among my own nation and in Jerusalem, all Jews know.

5. They knew me from long ago, if they were willing to testify, and that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.

6. And now I stand to be tried for the hope of the promise which God made to our fathers,

7. to which our twelve tribes devotedly serving God night and day hope to attain. For this hope I am accused by the Jews, O King.

8. "Why do all of you consider it incredible if God raises dead men?

9. I thought with myself that I ought to do much against the name of Jesus the Nazarene.

10. And I did it in Jerusalem and many holy men I shut up in prison, getting authority from the high priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.

11. In all the synagogues and often I punished them and compelled them to say profane words. Being excessively mad against them, I pursued them even to foreign cities.

12. "Thus engaged, as I was journeying to Damascus with authority and commission from the high priests,

13. about midday, on the road, I saw, O King, a light above the brightness of the sun shining from heaven around me and my companions.

14. We all fell to the ground and I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goad.'

15. I said, 'Who is speaking?' He said, 'I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.

16. But rise and stand on your feet: for I have appeared to you for the very purpose of appointing you a servant and a witness of the times you have seen me and of the times I shall appear to you.

17. I will deliver you from your people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you,

18. to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among those who are made holy by faith in me.'

19. After that, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,

20. but first to the people in Damascus and then to the people of Jerusalem and through all the land of Judaea and to the Gentiles, I proclaimed that they should repent and turn to God and do deeds suitable for a change of heart.

21. "For this reason Jews seized me in the Temple courts and tried to kill me.

22. But obtaining help from God I have continued until this day witnessing to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would be,

23. that the Christ would suffer and that he first, by rising from the dead, would proclaim light to our people and to the Gentiles."

24. While Paul was thus defending himself, Festus said loudly, "You are raving, Paul. Much learning is driving you insane."

25. "I am not insane," he said, "most noble Festus, but am uttering words of truth and soberness.

26. The King knows about this, and to him I speak with perfect frankness, for I am persuaded that not one of these things has escaped his attention, for this has not been done in a corner.

27. King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe them."

28. Agrippa said to Paul, "With little effort you are persuading me to become a Christian."

29. Paul said, "I would to God that whether with little or with much, not only you, but all who hear me this day, would become such as I am \'97 except for these chains."

30. Then the King rose and the Governor and Bernice and those who had been sitting with them,

31. and after withdrawing they said to one another, "This man is doing nothing deserving of death or chains."

32. Agrippa said to Festus, "This man could have been set at liberty if he had not appealed to Caesar."

## Acts 27

1. WHEN it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they committed Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of an imperial battalion.

2. Going on board a ship of Adramyttium which was about to sail to the places along the coast of Asia we put to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with us.

3. On the next day we reached Sidon, where Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him to go to see his friends and enjoy their attentions.

4. Putting to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus because the winds were contrary.

5. After crossing the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia.

6. There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy and put us on board of her.

7. By slow sailing for many days we with difficulty arrived off Cnidus. Then the wind being against us, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone

8. and with difficulty got past it and came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.

9. When much time had passed and sailing was now dangerous because it was already after the Fast, Paul addressed them.

10. "Men," he said, "I see that the voyage is going to be rough and with much loss not only of the cargo and the ship but also of our lives."

11. But the Centurion listened more to the sailing master and the ship owner than to what Paul said,

12. and as the harbor was not convenient to winter in, the majority adopted the purpose of sailing away on the chance of being able to reach Phoenix and winter there. Phoenix is a harbor of Crete facing the southwest and the northwest.

13. When the south wind blew softly, thinking that they had secured their purpose, they weighed anchor and coasted along Crete.

14. But before long a hurricane, such as is called Euraquilo, swept down off the land.

15. When the ship was caught and unable to keep her head to the wind, we gave up and let her drive before it.

16. Running under the lee of an island called Cauda, we contrived with difficulty to secure the small boat.

17. When we had got it in, we used ropes to undergird the ship. Fearing that we might get stranded on the Syrtis, they lowered the sail and so drifted.

18. So violently were we battered by the storm that on the next day they lightened the ship

19. and on the third day with their own hands they threw over the ship's tackle.

20. When for many days neither sun nor stars appeared and no small tempest lay on us, at last all hope of our being saved was being taken away.

21. After they had long gone without food, Paul stood up in the midst of them and said, "Men, you ought to have listened to me and not to have sailed away from Crete and met this rough experience and loss.

22. But now I beg you to have courage, for there will be no loss of life of any of you, but only of the ship.

23. For this night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood by me

24. and said, 'Never fear, Paul! You must stand before Caesar. And now God has granted to you all the men who are sailing with you.'

25. So cheer up, men. For I trust in God that it will be as it has been told me.

26. We must, however, run on to a certain island."

27. When the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven through the Adriatic, about midnight the sailors surmised that land was getting near.

28. Sounding they found twenty fathoms, and after a little they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms.

29. Then fearing that they might run into rocky places, they cast out four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come.

30. The sailors were intent on escaping from the ship and lowered the small boat into the sea under the pretense of laying out anchors from the bow,

31. but Paul said to the Centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved."

32. Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the small boat and let her fall off.

33. Until day began to dawn, Paul kept urging all to take food. He said, "To-day is the fourteenth day that you have been on the watch fasting, not taking anything.

34. Therefore, I beg you, take some food. For this is for your safety. Not a hair of the head of any one of you is going to perish."

35. Saying this he took a loaf and gave thanks to God before all and broke it and began to eat.

36. Then all cheered up and themselves took food.

37. We in the ship were in all two hundred and seventy-six souls.

38. After eating heartily, they lightened the ship, throwing over the wheat into the sea.

39. When day came they did not recognize the land, but they observed a bay with a beach. Into this they planned to run the ship if they could.

40. So abandoning the anchors they left them in the sea; at the same time loosening the bands of the steering oars and raising the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.

41. But falling into a place where there were cross-currents they ran the ship aground. The bow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was breaking up under the violence of the sea.

42. The soldiers' advice was to kill the prisoners for fear that some one of them might swim out and escape.

43. But the Centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them back from their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to shore,

44. and the rest to follow, some on boards and some on things from the ship. And so all got safe to land.

## Acts 28

1. WHEN we were safe ashore, we found that the island was called Melita.

2. The foreign people showed us uncommon kindness. For they kindled a fire and welcomed us all because of the rain that was falling and the cold.

3. Paul had collected a bundle of sticks and laid it on the fire, when a snake came out of the heat and fastened on his hand.

4. When the foreigners saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, "Certainly this man is a murderer, whom, although he has escaped the sea, Justice does not permit to live."

5. He however shook off the creature into the fire and felt no harm.

6. They kept watching to see him swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after watching a long time and seeing nothing amiss happen to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.

7. In the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the Governor of the island, whose name was Publius. He welcomed us and for three days hospitably entertained us.

8. It happened that the father of Publius was lying ill with fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him.

9. After this happened, the rest in the island who had infirmities came also and were healed.

10. They bestowed many honors on us and when we sailed they put on board supplies for our needs.

11. After three months we sailed in a ship that had wintered in the island. She was from Alexandria and her figure-head was the Twin Brothers.

12. Landing at Syracuse we remained there three days.

13. From there we came around and got to Rhegium. After one day there, a south wind sprang up and we came on the second day to Puteoli.

14. Here we found brethren and were begged by them to stay seven days. And so we came to Rome.

15. From there the brethren, when they got news of us, came to meet us as far as the Market of Appius and the Three Taverns. On seeing them Paul thanked God and took courage.

16. When we reached Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself with a soldier who guarded him.

17. After three days he invited the leading men among the Jews, and when they had assembled, he said to them, "Brethren, although I had done nothing against our people or our ancestral customs, I was delivered up as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.

18. They, after investigating my case, wished to set me free because I had done nothing deserving of death.

19. But when the Jews spoke against it, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not that I have any charge to bring against my own nation.

20. For this reason I have invited you to see me and talk with me; because it is for the sake of the hope of Israel that I have this chain around me."

21. They said to him, "We on our part have received no letters about you from Judaea nor has any one of the brethren come and reported or spoken anything evil of you.

22. We think it well to hear from you what your views are; for as to this sect we know that it is everywhere spoken against."
