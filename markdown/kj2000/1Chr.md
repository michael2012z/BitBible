25. And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and played the harlot with the gods of the people of the land, whom God destroyed before them.

26. And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this day.

## 1 Chronicles 9

1. So all Israel were recorded by genealogies; and, behold, they were written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah, who were carried away to Babylon for their transgression.

2. Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in their cities were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinim.

3. And in Jerusalem dwelt some of the children of Judah, and some of the children of Benjamin, and some of the children of Ephraim, and Manasseh;

17. And the gatekeepers were, Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum was the chief;

18. Who until then waited in the kingâ€™s gate eastward: they were gatekeepers in the camp of the children of Levi.

19. And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the host of the LORD, were keepers of the entrance.

20. And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time past, and the LORD was with him.

21. And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was gatekeeper at the door of the tabernacle of meeting.

23. So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of the LORD, namely, the house of the tabernacle, as guards.

24. In four quarters were the gatekeepers, toward the east, west, north, and south.

25. And their brethren, who were in their villages, were to come after seven days from time to time with them.

## 1 Chronicles 10

1. Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain on mount Gilboa.

2. And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.

3. And the battle went fierce against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers.

4. Then said Saul to his armorbearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armorbearer would not; for he was greatly afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.

5. And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on his sword, and died.

6. So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.

7. And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.

8. And it came to pass on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen on mount Gilboa.

9. And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.

10. And they put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.

11. And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,

12. They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

13. So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that was a medium, to seek council;

14. And inquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse.

## 1 Chronicles 11

1. Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.

2. And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, you were he that led out and brought in Israel: and the LORD your God said unto you, You shall feed my people Israel, and you shall be ruler over my people Israel.

3. Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.

4. And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.

5. And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, You shall not come here. Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion, which is the city of David.

6. And David said, Whosoever smites the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.

7. And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David.

8. And he built the city around it, even from Millo and around: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.

9. So David grew greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was with him.

10. These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.

11. And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, a Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.

12. And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.

13. He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where there was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.

14. And they set themselves in the midst of that plot, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great deliverance.

15. Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.

16. And David was then in the stronghold, and the Philistinesâ€™ garrison was then at Bethlehem.

17. And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me a drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!

18. And the three broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD,

19. And said, My God forbid me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.

20. And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three.

21. Of the three, he was more honorable than the two; for he was their captain: however he attained not to the first three.

22. Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many great deeds; he slew two lion-like men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit on a snowy day.

23. And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits tall; and in the Egyptianâ€™s hand was a spear like a weaverâ€™s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptianâ€™s hand, and slew him with his own spear.

24. These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and won a name among the three mighty men.

25. Behold, he was honorable among the thirty, but attained not to the first three: and David set him over his guard.

26. Also the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

27. Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,

28. Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anthothite,

29. Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,

30. Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,

31. Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, that belonged to the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,

32. Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,

33. Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,

34. The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shagee the Hararite,

35. Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,

36. Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,

37. Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,

38. Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri,

39. Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, the armorbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,

40. Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,

41. Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,

42. Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a chief of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,

43. Hanan the son of Maacah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,

44. Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,

45. Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,

46. Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,

47. Eliel, and Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.

## 1 Chronicles 12

1. Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they were among the mighty men, helpers of the war.

2. They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saulâ€™s brethren of Benjamin.

3. The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Beracah, and Jehu the Anthothite,

4. And Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite,

6. Elkanah, and Isshiah, and Azarel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites,

7. And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.

8. And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David at the stronghold in the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit for the battle, that could handle shield and spear, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the gazelles upon the mountains;

9. Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,

10. Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,

11. Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,

12. Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,

13. Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh.

14. These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the army: one of the least was over a hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.

15. These are they that went over the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.

16. And there came from the children of Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold unto David.

17. And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If you are come peaceably unto me to help me, my heart shall be knit unto you: but if you are come to betray me to my enemies, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers look on it, and rebuke it.

18. Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Yours we are, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto you, and peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you. Then David received them, and made them captains of his troop.

19. And there deserted some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines after counsel sent him away, saying, He will desert to his master Saul to the peril of our heads.

20. As he went to Ziklag, there deserted to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zellethai, captains of the thousands that were from Manasseh.

21. And they helped David against the band of raiders: for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the army.

22. For at that time day by day there came more to David to help him, until it was a great army, like the army of God.

23. And these are the numbers of the men that were ready armed for war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.

24. The children of Judah that bore shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed for war.

25. Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valor for war, seven thousand and one hundred.

26. Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.

27. And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were three thousand and seven hundred;

28. And Zadok, a young man mighty of valor, and of his fatherâ€™s house twenty and two captains.

29. And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for until now the greatest part of them had remained loyal to the house of Saul.

30. And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men throughout the house of their fathers.

31. And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were designated by name, to come and make David king.

32. And of the children of Issachar, who were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were under their command.

33. Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, who could keep ranks: they had singleness of heart.

34. And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand.

35. And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.

36. And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty thousand.

37. And on the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for battle, a hundred and twenty thousand.

38. All these men of war, that could keep ranks, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.

39. And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.

40. Moreover they that were near them, even from Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought food on donkeys, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and supplies of meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there was joy in Israel.

## 1 Chronicles 13

1. And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader.

2. And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seems good unto you, and that it is of the LORD our God, let us send out unto our brethren everywhere, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites who are in their cities and pasture lands, that they may gather themselves unto us:

3. And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we have not inquired at it in the days of Saul.

4. And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.

5. So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.

6. And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God the LORD, who dwells between the cherubim, whose name is proclaimed there.

7. And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzzah and Ahio drove the cart.

8. And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with lyres, and with tambourines, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

9. And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzzah put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.

10. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah, and he struck him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.

11. And David was displeased, because the LORD had broken forth upon Uzzah: therefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this day.

12. And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?

13. So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.

14. And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.

## 1 Chronicles 14

1. Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him a house.

2. And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.

3. And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.

4. Now these are the names of his children whom he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,

5. And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,

6. And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

7. And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.

8. And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it, and went out against them.

9. And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.

10. And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and will you deliver them into my hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand.

11. So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David defeated them there. Then David said, God has broken in upon my enemies by my hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.

12. And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.

13. And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.

14. Therefore David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them opposite the balsam trees.

15. And it shall be, when you shall hear a sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, that then you shall go out to battle: for God has gone forth before you to smite the army of the Philistines.

16. David therefore did as God commanded him: and they struck the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.

17. And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.

## 1 Chronicles 15

1. And David made himself houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.

2. Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them has the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him forever.

3. And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto its place, which he had prepared for it.

4. And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:

5. Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twenty:

6. Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:

7. Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and thirty:

8. Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:

9. Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:

10. Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve.

11. And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,

12. And said unto them, You are the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses of the Levites: Sanctify yourselves, both you and your brethren, that you may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it.

13. For because you did it not at the first, the LORD our God broke forth upon us, for we sought him not about the proper order.

14. So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.

15. And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God upon their shoulders with the its poles, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.

16. And David spoke to the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of music, lyres and harps and cymbals sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.

17. So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;

18. And with them their brethren of the second order, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers.

19. So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of bronze;

20. And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with harps according to Alamoth;

21. And Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with lyres according to the Sheminith, to lead.

22. And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, in music: he instructed about the music, because he was skillful.

23. And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.

24. And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.

25. So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.

26. And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.

27. And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the leader of the music with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen.

28. Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making music with lyres and harps.

29. And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.

## 1 Chronicles 16

1. So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.

2. And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.

3. And he gave to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins.

4. And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to invoke, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:

5. Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with lyres and with harps; but Asaph made music with cymbals;

6. Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests blew trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.

7. Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.

8. Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.

9. Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk you of all his wondrous works.

10. Glory you in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.

11. Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.

12. Remember his marvelous works that he has done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;

13. O you descendants of Israel his servant, you children of Jacob, his chosen ones.

14. He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.

15. Be you mindful always of his covenant; the word which he commanded to a thousand generations;

16. Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;

17. And has confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,

18. Saying, Unto you will I give the land of Canaan, the portion of your inheritance;

19. When you were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.

20. And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people;

21. He allowed no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,

22. Saying, Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

23. Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; show forth from day to day his salvation.

24. Declare his glory among the nations; his marvelous works among all peoples.

25. For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods.

26. For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.

27. Glory and honor are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place.

28. Give unto the LORD, you families of the peoples, give unto the LORD glory and strength.

29. Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.

30. Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.

31. Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The LORD reigns.

32. Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein.

33. Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he comes to judge the earth.

34. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy endures forever.

35. And say, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name, and glory in your praise.

36. Blessed be the LORD God of Israel forever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.

37. So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every dayâ€™s work required:

38. And Obed-edom with his brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be gatekeepers:

39. And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,

40. To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel;

41. And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were designated by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy endures forever;

42. And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were gatekeepers.

43. And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.

## 1 Chronicles 17

1. Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remains under curtains.

2. Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in your heart; for God is with you.

3. And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,

4. Go and tell David my servant, Thus says the LORD, You shall not build me a house to dwell in:

5. For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.

6. Wherever I have walked with all Israel, spoke I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have you not built me a house of cedars?

7. Now therefore thus shall you say unto my servant David, Thus says the LORD of hosts, I took you from the sheepfold, even from following the sheep, that you should be ruler over my people Israel:

8. And I have been with you wherever you have walked, and have cut off all your enemies from before you, and have made you a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.

9. Also I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness oppress them any more, as at the beginning,

10. And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all your enemies. Furthermore I tell you that the LORD will build you a house.

11. And it shall come to pass, when your days are ended that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will raise up your descendant after you, who shall be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.

12. He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.

13. I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before you:

14. But I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever: and his throne shall be established forevermore.

15. According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.

16. And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that you have brought me this far?

17. And yet this was a small thing in your eyes, O God; for you have also spoken of your servantâ€™s house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.

18. What can David speak more to you for the honor of your servant? for you know your servant.

19. O LORD, for your servantâ€™s sake, and according to your own heart, have you done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.

20. O LORD, there is none like you, neither is there any God beside you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.

21. And what one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make you a name of greatness and awesomeness, by driving out nations from before your people, whom you have redeemed out of Egypt?

22. For your people Israel did you make your own people forever; and you, LORD, became their God.

23. Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house be established forever, and do as you have said.

24. Let it even be established, that your name may be magnified forever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David your servant be established before you.

25. For you, O my God, have told your servant that you will build him a house: therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray before you.

26. And now, LORD, you are God, and have promised this goodness unto your servant:

27. Now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may be before you forever: for you bless, O LORD, and it shall be blessed forever.

## 1 Chronicles 18

1. Now after this it came to pass, that David defeated the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.

2. And he defeated Moab; and the Moabites became Davidâ€™s servants, and brought tribute.

3. And David defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to establish his rule by the river Euphrates.

4. And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them a hundred chariots.

5. And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.

6. Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became Davidâ€™s servants, and brought tribute. Thus the LORD preserved David wherever he went.

7. And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

8. Likewise from Tibhath, and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, brought David very much bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of bronze.

9. Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah;

10. He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and defeated him; (for Hadadezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and bronze.

11. Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.

12. Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.

13. And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became Davidâ€™s servants. Thus the LORD preserved David wherever he went.

14. So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.

15. And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.

16. And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;

17. And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief officials at the kingâ€™s side.

## 1 Chronicles 19

1. Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.

2. And David said, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.

3. But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Think you that David does honor your father, that he has sent comforters unto you? are not his servants come unto you to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?

4. Therefore Hanun took Davidâ€™s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle at their buttocks, and sent them away.

5. Then there went certain, and told David how the men were treated. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Remain at Jericho until your beards are grown, and then return.

6. And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves repulsive to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire themselves chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Aram-maachah, and out of Zobah.

7. So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and encamped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.

8. And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men.

9. And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that had come were by themselves in the field.

10. Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him in front and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.

11. And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon.

12. And he said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me: but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you.

13. Be of good courage, and let us fight valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight.

14. So Joab and the people that were with him drew near before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.

15. And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.

16. And when the Syrians saw that they were defeated before Israel, they sent messengers, and brought forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the army of Hadadezer went before them.

17. And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over the Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.

18. But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men who fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the army.

19. And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.

## 1 Chronicles 20

1. And it came to pass, that after the year was ended, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the strength of the army, and ravaged the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem. And Joab defeated Rabbah, and destroyed it.

2. And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon Davidâ€™s head: and he brought also a great amount of spoil out of the city.

3. And he brought out the people that were in it, and put them to work with saws, and with picks of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

4. And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.

5. And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spearâ€™s shaft was like a weaverâ€™s beam.

6. And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot: and he also was the son of the giant.

7. But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea Davidâ€™s brother slew him.

8. These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

## 1 Chronicles 21

1. And Satan stood up against Israel, and incited David to number Israel.

2. And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it.

3. And Joab answered, The LORD make his people a hundred times so many more as they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lordâ€™s servants? why then does my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?

4. Nevertheless the kingâ€™s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.

5. And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.

6. But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the kingâ€™s command was abominable to Joab.

7. And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.

8. And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech you, take away the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.

9. And the LORD spoke unto Gad, Davidâ€™s seer, saying,

10. Go and tell David, saying, Thus says the LORD, I offer you three things: choose you one of them, that I may do it unto you.

11. So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus says the LORD, Choose you

12. Either three yearsâ€™ famine; or three months to be destroyed before your foes, while that the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the territory of Israel. Now therefore decide what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.

13. And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.

14. So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.

15. And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he relented of the disaster, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, restrain now your hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

16. And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.

17. And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let your hand, I pray you, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my fatherâ€™s house; but not on your people, that they should be plagued.

18. Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

19. And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the LORD.

20. And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.

21. And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.

22. Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar on it unto the LORD: you shall give it to me for the full price: that the plague may be averted from the people.

23. And Ornan said unto David, Take it to yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give you the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering; I give it all.

24. And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will indeed buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is yours for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.

25. So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.

26. And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.

27. And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into its sheath.

28. At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.

29. For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.

30. But David could not go before it to inquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.

## 1 Chronicles 22

1. Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.

2. And David commanded to gather together the sojourners that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to cut hewn stones to build the house of God.

3. And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the fittings; and bronze in abundance without weight;

4. Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.

5. And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.

6. Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel.

7. And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house unto the name of the LORD my God:

8. But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars: you shall not build a house unto my name, because you have shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.

9. Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.

10. He shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.

11. Now, my son, the LORD be with you; and prosper you, and build the house of the LORD your God, as he has said of you.

12. Only the LORD give you wisdom and understanding, and give you charge concerning Israel, that you may keep the law of the LORD your God.

13. Then shall you prosper, if you take heed to fulfill the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.

14. Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of bronze and iron beyond weighing; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and you may add to it.

15. Moreover there are workmen with you in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of skillful men for every manner of work.

16. Of the gold, the silver, and the bronze, and the iron, there is no limit. Arise therefore, and begin working, and the LORD be with you.

17. David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,

18. Is not the LORD your God with you? and has he not given you rest on every side? for he has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people.

19. Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build you the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.

## 1 Chronicles 23

1. So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.

2. And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.

3. Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.

4. Of which, twenty and four thousand were to look after the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:

5. Moreover four thousand were gatekeepers; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, for praise.

6. And David divided them into divisions among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

7. Of the Gershonites were, Ladan, and Shimei.

8. The sons of Ladan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.

9. The sons of Shimei; Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses of Ladan.

10. And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.

11. And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, as one fatherâ€™s house.

12. The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.

13. The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons forever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to give the blessing in his name forever.

14. Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.

15. The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.

16. Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.

17. And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.

18. Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.

19. Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.

20. Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first, and Issiah the second.

21. The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.

22. And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.

23. The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.

24. These were the sons of Levi by their fathersâ€™ houses; even the heads of their fathersâ€™ houses, as they were counted individually by the number of their names, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.

25. For David said, The LORD God of Israel has given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem forever:

26. And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.

27. For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above:

28. Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;

29. Both for the showbread, and for the fine flour for meal offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is mixed with all kinds of measures and sizes;

30. And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at evening;

31. And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD on the sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to that required of them, continually before the LORD:

32. And that they should attend to the needs of the tabernacle of meeting, and the needs of the holy place, and the needs of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD.

## 1 Chronicles 24

1. Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

2. But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priestâ€™s office.

3. And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service.

4. And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and thus were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen heads of their fathersâ€™ houses, and eight heads of their fathersâ€™ houses among the sons of Ithamar.

5. Thus were they divided by lot, one group as another; for the officials of the sanctuary, and officials of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.

6. And Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them down before the king, and the leaders, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses of the priests and Levites: one fatherâ€™s house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.

7. Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,

8. The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,

9. The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,

10. The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,

11. The ninth to Jeshuah, the tenth to Shecaniah,

12. The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,

13. The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,

14. The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,

15. The seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,

16. The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,

17. The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul,

18. The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah.

19. This was the schedule of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their procedure established under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.

20. And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.

21. Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was Isshiah.

22. Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath.

23. And the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.

24. Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah: of the sons of Micah; Shamir.

25. The brother of Micah was Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah; Zechariah.

26. The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno.

27. The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.

28. Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons.

29. Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel.

30. The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites according to the house of their fathers.

31. These likewise cast lots even as their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses of the priests and Levites; the principal fathers did even as their younger brethren.

## 1 Chronicles 25

1. Moreover David and the captains of the army separated for the service some of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with lyres, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was:

2. Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asharelah, the sons of Asaph under the direction of Asaph, who prophesied according to the order of the king.

3. Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Shemei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give thanks and to praise the LORD.

4. Of Heman: the sons of Heman; Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth:

5. All these were the sons of Heman the kingâ€™s seer in the words of God, to exalt the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.

6. All these were under the direction of their father in the music in the house of the LORD, with cymbals, lyres, and harps, for the service of the house of God, according to the kingâ€™s order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.

7. So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the LORD, even all that were skillful, was two hundred fourscore and eight.

8. And they cast lots for their duties, the small as well as the great, the teacher as well as the student.

9. Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second to Gedaliah, who with his brethren and sons were twelve:

## 1 Chronicles 26

1. Concerning the divisions of the gatekeepers: Of the Korahites was Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.

2. And the sons of Meshelemiah were, Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,

3. Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Eliehoenai the seventh.

4. Moreover the sons of Obed-edom were, Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth, and Nethanel the fifth,

5. Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peullethai the eighth: for God blessed him.

6. Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled throughout the house of their father: for they were mighty men of valor.

7. The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose brethren were strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah.

8. All these of the sons of Obed-edom: they and their sons and their brethren, able men for strength for the service, were threescore and two of Obed-edom.

9. And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, strong men, eighteen.

10. Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Shimri the chief, (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him the chief;)

11. Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth: all the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen.

12. Among these were the divisions of the gatekeepers, even among the chief men, having duties like one another, to minister in the house of the LORD.

13. And they cast lots, the small as well as the great, according to the house of their fathers, for every gate.

14. And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counselor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward.

15. To Obed-edom southward; and to his sons the storehouse.

16. To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the gate Shallecheth, by the road that goes up, watch opposite watch.

17. Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and for the storehouse two by two.

18. At Parbar westward, four at the road, and two at Parbar.

19. These are the divisions of the gatekeepers among the sons of Korah, and among the sons of Merari.

20. And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasuries of the house of God, and over the treasuries of the dedicated things.

21. As concerning the sons of Ladan; the sons of the Gershonite Ladan, the heads of their fathersâ€™ houses, even of Ladan the Gershonite, were Jehieli.

22. The sons of Jehieli; Zetham, and Joel his brother, who were over the treasuries of the house of the LORD.

23. Of the Amramites, and the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites:

24. And Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was overseer of the treasuries.

25. And his brethren by Eliezer; Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomoth his son.

26. This Shelomoth and his brethren were over all the treasuries of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the heads of the fathers' houses, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the army, had dedicated.

27. Out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain the house of the LORD.

28. And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated; and whosoever had dedicated anything, it was under the hand of Shelomoth, and of his brethren.

29. Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons performed the outside duties over Israel, as officers and judges.

30. And of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, men of valor, a thousand and seven hundred, were officers over them of Israel on this side of the Jordan westward in all the business of the LORD, and in the service of the king.

31. Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even among the Hebronites, according to the genealogy of his fathers. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for, and there were found among them mighty men of valor at Jazer of Gilead.

32. And his brethren, men of valor, were two thousand and seven hundred heads of the fathers' houses, whom king David made officials over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the king.

## 1 Chronicles 27

1. Now the children of Israel according to their number, the heads of the fathers' houses and captains of thousands and hundreds, and their officers that served the king in any matter of the divisions, who came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year, of every division were twenty and four thousand.

22. Of Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham. These were the leaders of the tribes of Israel.

23. But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the LORD had said he would increase Israel like the stars of the heavens.

24. Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not, because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David.

25. And over the kingâ€™s treasuries was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the towers, was Jonathan the son of Uzziah:

26. And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub:

32. Also Jonathan Davidâ€™s uncle was a counselor, a wise man, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the kingâ€™s sons:

33. And Ahithophel was the kingâ€™s counselor: and Hushai the Archite was the kingâ€™s companion:

34. And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the general of the kingâ€™s army was Joab.

## 1 Chronicles 28

1. And David assembled all the leaders of Israel, the leaders of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by division, and the captains over the thousands, and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the substance and possessions of the king, and of his sons, with the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men, unto Jerusalem.

2. Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building:

3. But God said unto me, You shall not build a house for my name, because you have been a man of war, and have shed blood.

4. However the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever: for he has chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel:

5. And of all my sons, (for the LORD has given me many sons,) he has chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.

6. And he said unto me, Solomon your son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.

7. Moreover I will establish his kingdom forever, if he is steadfast to keep my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.

8. Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you forever.

9. And you, Solomon my son, know you the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts: if you seek him, he will be found of you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever.

10. Take heed now; for the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.

11. Then David gave to Solomon his son the plans of the vestibule, and of its houses, and of its treasuries, and of its upper chambers, and of its inner chambers, and of the place for the mercy seat,

12. And the plans for all that he had by the Spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:

13. Also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD.

14. He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all articles of all manner of service; silver also for all articles of silver by weight, for all articles of every kind of service:

15. Even the weight for the lampstands of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every lampstand, and for the lamps thereof: and for the lampstands of silver by weight, both for the lampstand, and also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every lampstand.

16. And by weight he gave gold for the tables of showbread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:

17. Also pure gold for the forks, and the basins, and the cups: and for the golden bowls he gave gold by weight for every bowl; and likewise silver by weight for every bowl of silver:

18. And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the plan of the chariot of the cherubim, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.

19. All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this plan.

20. And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my God, will be with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you, until you have finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.

21. And, behold, the divisions of the priests and the Levites, even they shall be with you for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with you for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the leaders and all the people will be wholly at your command.

## 1 Chronicles 29

1. Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God.

2. Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the bronze for things of bronze, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistening stones, and of various colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.

3. Moreover, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, I have of my own things, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,

4. Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses:

5. The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of craftsmen. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD?

6. Then the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses and the leaders of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the officers over the kingâ€™s work, offered willingly,

7. And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of bronze eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.

8. And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.

9. Then the people rejoiced, for they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.

10. Therefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be you, LORD God of Israel our father, forever and ever.

11. Yours, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is yours; yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all.

12. Both riches and honor come from you, and you reign over all; and in your hand is power and might; and in your hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.

13. Now therefore, our God, we thank you, and praise your glorious name.

14. But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? for all things come from you, and of your own have we given you.

15. For we are strangers before you, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding.

16. O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand, and is all your own.

17. I know also, my God, that you test the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy your people, who are present here, to offer willingly unto you.

18. O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and direct their heart unto you:

19. And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.

20. And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshiped the LORD, and the king.

21. And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the next day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:

22. And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the prince, and Zadok to be priest.

23. Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.

24. And all the leaders, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.

25. And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.

26. Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.

27. And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.

28. And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.

29. Now the acts of David the king, from first to last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,

30. With all his reign and his might, and the events that happened to him, and to Israel, and to all the kingdoms of the countries.
