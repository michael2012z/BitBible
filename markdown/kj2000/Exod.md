# Exodus

## Exodus 1

1. Now these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.

2. Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,

3. Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,

4. Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.

5. And all persons that were direct offspring of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.

6. And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.

7. And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.

8. Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.

9. And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:

10. Come, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there come upon us any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so escape out of the land.

11. Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.

12. But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.

13. And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor:

14. And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, in which they made them serve, was with rigor.

15. And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:

16. And he said, When you serve as a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then you shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.

17. But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male children alive.

18. And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have you done this thing, and have saved the male children alive?

19. And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous, and are delivered before the midwives come in unto them.

20. Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty.

21. And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he gave them families.

22. And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born you shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.

## Exodus 2

1. And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.

2. And the woman conceived, and bore a son: and when she saw him that he was a fine child, she hid him three months.

3. And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with tar and with pitch, and put the child in it; and she laid it among the reeds by the river's bank.

4. And his sister stood far off, to know what would be done to him.

5. And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the reeds, she sent her maid to get it.

6. And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.

7. Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to you a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?

8. And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the girl went and called the child's mother.

9. And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give you your wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.

10. And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.

11. And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.

12. And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.

13. And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Why strike you your fellow?

14. And he said, Who made you a prince and a judge over us? do you intend to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.

15. Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.

16. Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.

17. And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.

18. And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that you are come so soon today?

19. And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.

20. And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that you have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.

21. And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.

22. And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.

23. And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel groaned by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.

24. And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

25. And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had concern for them.

## Exodus 3

1. Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the west side of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.

2. And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.

3. And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.

4. And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.

5. And he said, Draw not near here: put off your shoes from your feet, for the place on which you stand is holy ground.

6. Moreover he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, andthe God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.

7. And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;

8. And I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good and large land, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.

9. Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.

10. Come now therefore, and I will send you unto Pharaoh, that you may bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.

11. And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?

12. And he said, Certainly I will be with you; and this shall be a token unto you, that I have sent you: When you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God upon this mountain.

13. And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers has sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?

14. And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shall you say unto the children of Israel, I AM has sent me unto you.

15. And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shall you say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me unto you: this is my name forever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.

16. Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers,the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:

17. And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.

18. And they shall hearken to your voice: and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and you shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews has met with us: and now let us go, we beseech you, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.

19. And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.

20. And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst of it: and after that he will let you go.

21. And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when you go, you shall not go empty:

22. But every woman shall request of her neighbor, and of her that sojourns in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing: and you shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and you shall spoil the Egyptians.

## Exodus 4

1. And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD has not appeared unto you.

2. And the LORD said unto him, What is that inyour hand? And he said, A rod.

3. And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.

4. And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth yourhand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:

5. That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared unto you.

6. And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Putnow your hand into your bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was as leprous as snow.

7. And he said, Put your hand into your bosomagain. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and took it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.

8. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe you, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.

9. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto your voice, that you shall take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which you take out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.

10. And Moses said unto the LORD, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither before, nor since you have spoken unto your servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.

11. And the LORD said unto him, Who has made man's mouth? or who makes the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?

12. Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall say.

13. And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray you, by the hand of another whom you will send.

14. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite your brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he comes forth to meet you: and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.

15. And you shall speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.

16. And he shall be your spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to you instead of a mouth, and you shall be to him instead of God.

17. And you shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do signs.

18. And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray you, and return unto my brethren who are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.

19. And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead who sought your life.

20. And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.

21. And the LORD said unto Moses, When you goto return into Egypt, see that you do all those wonders before Pharaoh, whom I have put in your hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.

22. And you shall say unto Pharaoh, Thus says the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:

23. And I say unto you, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if you refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay your son, even your firstborn.

24. And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.

25. Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband are you to me.

26. So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband you are, because of the circumcision.

27. And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into thewilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.

28. And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.

29. And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:

30. And Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.

31. And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped.

## Exodus 5

1. And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.

2. And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.

3. And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us: let us go, we pray you, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.

4. And the king of Egypt said unto them, Why do you, Moses and Aaron, take the people from their work? get you unto your burdens.

5. And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and you make them rest from their burdens.

6. And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,

7. You shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as before: let them go and gather straw for themselves.

8. And the number of the bricks, which they did make before, you shall lay upon them; you shall not diminish any of them: for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.

9. Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labor in it; and let them not give regard to vain words.

10. And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus says Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.

11. Go, get you straw where you can find it: yet not any of your work shall be diminished.

12. So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.

13. And the taskmasters pushed them, saying, Fulfill your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.

14. And the officers of the children of Israel, that Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and asked, Why have you not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and today, as before?

15. Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Why dealt you thus with your servants?

16. There is no straw given unto your servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.

17. But he said, you are idle, you are idle: therefore you say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.

18. Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall you deliver the number of bricks.

19. And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in an evil plight, after it was said, you shall not reduce any from your bricks of your daily task.

20. And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:

21. And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because you have made our favor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.

22. And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, why have you brought evil upon this people? why is it that you have sent me?

23. For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has done evil to this people; neither have you delivered your people at all.

## Exodus 6

1. Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shall you see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.

2. And God spoke unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD:

3. And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name the LORD was I not known to them.

4. And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, in which they were strangers.

5. And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.

6. Therefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments:

7. And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

8. And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am the LORD.

9. And Moses spoke so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses because of anguish of spirit, and of cruel bondage.

10. And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,

11. Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.

12. And Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?

13. And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

14. These are the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these are the families of Reuben.

15. And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families of Simeon.

16. And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi were a hundred thirty and seven years.

17. The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimei, according to their families.

18. And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were a hundred thirty and three years.

19. And the sons of Merari; Mahli and Mushi: these are the families of Levi according to their generations.

20. And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister as wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty and seven years.

21. And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.

22. And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri.

23. And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Nahshon, as wife; and she bore him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

24. And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the families of the Korahites.

25. And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel as wife; and she bore him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.

26. These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.

27. These are they who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.

28. And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spoke unto Moses in the land of Egypt,

29. That the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak you unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto you.

30. And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?

## Exodus 7

1. And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made you a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet.

2. You shall speak all that I command you: and Aaron your brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.

3. And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.

4. But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth my armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.

5. And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.

6. And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.

7. And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spoke unto Pharaoh.

8. And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

9. When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Show a miracle for proof: then you shall say unto Aaron, Take your rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.

10. And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.

11. Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.

12. For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

13. And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.

14. And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuses to let the people go.

15. Get you unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goes out unto the water; and you shall stand by the river's bank until he comes; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shall you take in your hand.

16. And you shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews has sent me unto you, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, before you would not hear.

17. Thus says the LORD, In this you shall knowthat I am the LORD: behold, I will strike with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.

18. And the fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink of the water of the river.

19. And the LORD spoke unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take your rod, and stretch out your hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.

20. And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.

21. And the fish that were in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.

22. And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said.

23. And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he lay to heart this also.

24. And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.

25. And seven days were fulfilled, after the LORD had smitten the river.

## Exodus 8

1. And the LORD spoke unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus says the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

2. And if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all your borders with frogs:

3. And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into your house, and into your bedchamber, and upon your bed, and into the house of your servants, and upon your people, and into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs:

4. And the frogs shall come up both on you, and upon your people, and upon all your servants.

5. And the LORD spoke unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth your hand with your rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over theponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.

6. And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.

7. And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.

8. Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.

9. And Moses said unto Pharaoh, You tell me: when shall I entreat for you, and for your servants, and for your people, to destroy the frogs from you and your houses, that they may remain in the river only?

10. And he said, Tomorrow. And he said, Be it according to your word: that you may know that there is none like unto the LORD our God.

11. And the frogs shall depart from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people; they shall remain in the river only.

12. And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.

13. And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.

14. And they gathered them together in heaps: and the land stank.

15. But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.

16. And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out your rod, and strike the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.

17. And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.

18. And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.

19. Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.

20. And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up earlyin the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he comes forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus says the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

21. Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon you, and upon your servants, and upon your people, and into your houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they are.

22. And I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end you may know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.

23. And I will put a division between my people and your people: tomorrow shall this sign be.

24. And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.

25. And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go, sacrifice to your God in the land.

26. And Moses said, It is not proper so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?

27. We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.

28. And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away: entreat for me.

29. And Moses said, Behold, I go out from you, and I will entreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.

30. And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.

31. And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.

32. And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.

## Exodus 9

1. Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus says the LORD God ofthe Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

2. For if you refuse to let them go, and will hold them still,

3. Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon your cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the donkeys, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous plague.

4. And the LORD shall make distinction between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all belonging to the children of Israel.

5. And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, Tomorrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land.

6. And the LORD did that thing the next day, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel not one died.

7. And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.

8. And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.

9. And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be boils breaking forth with sores upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.

10. And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became boils breaking forth with sores upon man, and upon beast.

11. And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.

12. And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.

13. And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus says the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

14. For I will at this time send all my plagues upon your heart, and upon your servants, and upon your people; that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth.

15. For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite you and your people with pestilence; and you shall be cut off from the earth.

16. And indeed for this very cause have I raised you up, to show in you my power; and that myname may be declared throughout all the earth.

17. And yet exalt you yourself against my people, that you will not let them go?

18. Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the foundation of it even until now.

19. Send therefore now, and gather your cattle, and all that you have in the field; for upon every man and beast that shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.

20. He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:

21. And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.

22. And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth your hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.

23. And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.

24. So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.

25. And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.

26. Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.

27. And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.

28. Entreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.

29. And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will stretch forth my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that you may know that the earth is the LORD's.

30. But as for you and your servants, I know that you will not yet fear the LORD God.

31. And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bud.

32. But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten: for they were not yet grown up.

33. And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and stretched forth his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.

34. And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.

35. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.

## Exodus 10

1. And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might show these my signs before him:

2. And that you may tell in the ears of your son, and of your son's son, what things I have done in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that you may know that I am the LORD.

3. And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus says the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.

4. Else, if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow will I bring the locusts into your land:

5. And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remains unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field:

6. And they shall fill your houses, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither your fathers, nor your fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned, and went out from Pharaoh.

7. And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: know you not yet that Egypt is destroyed?

8. And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?

9. And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.

10. And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.

11. Not so: go now you that are men, and serve the LORD; for that you did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.

12. And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left.

13. And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.

14. And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the country of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.

15. For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.

16. Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.

17. Now therefore forgive, I pray you, my sin only this once, and entreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.

18. And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.

19. And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the land of Egypt.

20. But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.

21. And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.

22. And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:

23. They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.

24. And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be left behind: let your little ones also go with you.

25. And Moses said, you must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.

26. Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind; for of them must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come there.

27. But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.

28. And Pharaoh said unto him, Get you from me, take heed to yourself, see my face no more; for in that day you see my face you shall die.

29. And Moses said, You have spoken well, I will see your face again no more.

## Exodus 11

1. And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go from here: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out from here altogether.

2. Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man request of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.

3. And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.

4. And Moses said, Thus says the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:

5. And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sits upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.

6. And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.

7. But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that you may know that the LORD does put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.

8. And all these your servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get out, and all the people that follow you: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in great anger.

9. And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.

10. And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.

## Exodus 12

1. And the LORD spoke unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,

2. This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.

3. Speak unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for a house:

4. And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of persons; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.

5. Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: you shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:

6. And you shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.

7. And they shall take of the blood, and put it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, in which they shall eat it.

8. And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.

9. Eat not of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire; its head with its legs, and with the inner parts thereof.

10. And you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire.

11. And thus shall you eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD'S passover.

12. For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.

13. And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shallnot be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.

14. And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and you shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever.

15. Seven days shall you eat unleavened bread; even the first day you shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.

16. And in the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation for you; no manner of work shall be done on them, except that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you.

17. And you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this very same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall you observe this day in your generations by an ordinance forever.

18. In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at evening.

19. Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eats that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.

20. You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwellings shall you eat unleavened bread.

21. Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.

22. And you shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.

23. For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to come in unto your houses to slay you.

24. And you shall observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to your sons forever.

25. And it shall come to pass, when you are come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he has promised, that you shall keep this service.

26. And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean you by this service?

27. That you shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD'S passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshiped.

28. And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

29. And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.

30. And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.

31. And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and go forth from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as you have said.

32. Also take your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also.

33. And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We are all dead men.

34. And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.

35. And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they requested of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing:

36. And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they gave unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.

37. And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, besides children.

38. And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very many cattle.

39. And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any provisions.

40. Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.

41. And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the very same day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.

42. It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed by all the children of Israel in their generations.

43. And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no foreigner eat of it:

44. But every man's servant that is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.

45. A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat of it.

46. In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not carry forth any of the flesh outside of the house; neither shall you break a bone of it.

47. All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

48. And when a foreigner shall sojourn with you, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.

49. One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the foreigner who sojourns among you.

50. Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

51. And it came to pass the very same day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.

## Exodus 13

1. And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,

2. Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.

3. And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.

4. This day you came out in the month Abib.

5. And it shall be when the LORD shall bring you into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he swore unto your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this service in this month.

6. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD.

7. Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with you, neither shall there be leaven seen with you in all your quarters.

8. And you shall show your son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.

9. And it shall be for a sign unto you upon your hand, and for a memorial before your eyes, that the LORD's law may be in your mouth: for with a strong hand has the LORD brought you out of Egypt.

10. You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.

11. And it shall be when the LORD shall bring you into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore unto you and to your fathers, and shall give it to you,

12. That you shall set apart unto the LORD all that opens the womb, and every firstling that comes of a beast which you have; the males shall be the LORD'S.

13. And every firstling of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck: and all the firstborn of man among your children shall you redeem.

14. And it shall be when your son asks you in time to come, saying, What is this? that you shall say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:

15. And it came to pass, when Pharaoh refused to let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that opens the womb, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.

16. And it shall be for a sign upon your hand, and for frontlets between your eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.

17. And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest perhaps the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:

18. But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up equipped for battle out of the land of Egypt.

19. And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had solemnly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you.

20. And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.

21. And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them in the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:

22. He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.

## Exodus 14

1. And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,

2. Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall you encamp by the sea.

3. For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness has shut them in.

4. And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will get glory over Pharaoh, and over all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.

5. And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?

6. And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:

7. And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.

8. And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with defiance.

9. But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamped by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.

10. And when Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were greatly afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.

11. And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? why have you dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?

12. Is not this the word that we did tell you in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.

13. And Moses said unto the people, Fear not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will show to you today: for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you shall see them again no more forever.

14. The LORD shall fight for you, and you shall hold your peace.

15. And the LORD said unto Moses, Why do you cry unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:

16. But lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.

17. And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get honor over Pharaoh, and over all his host, over his chariots, and over his horsemen.

18. And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten honor over Pharaoh, over his chariots, and over his horsemen.

19. And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:

20. And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.

21. And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.

22. And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.

23. And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.

24. And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,

25. And took off their chariot wheels, that they drove them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians.

26. And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.

27. And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its place when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.

28. And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.

29. But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.

30. Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.

31. And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.

## Exodus 15

1. Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.

2. The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him a habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.

3. The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.

4. Pharaoh's chariots and his host has he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.

5. The depths have covered them: they sank to the bottom as a stone.

6. Your right hand, O LORD, has become glorious in power: your right hand, O LORD, has dashed in pieces the enemy.

7. And in the greatness of your excellency you have overthrown them that rose up against you: you sent forth your wrath, which consumed them as stubble.

8. And with the blast of your nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as a heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.

9. The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.

10. You did blow with your wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.

11. Who is like unto you, O LORD, among the gods? who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?

12. You stretched out your right hand, the earth swallowed them.

13. You in your mercy have led forth the people whom you have redeemed: you have guided them in your strength unto your holy habitation.

14. The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.

15. Then the chiefs of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.

16. Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of your arm they shall be as still as a stone; till your people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, whom you have purchased.

17. You shall bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which you have made for you to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O Lord, which your hands have established.

18. The LORD shall reign forever and ever.

19. For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea.

20. And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.

21. And Miriam answered them, Sing unto the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; the horse and its rider has he thrown into the sea.

22. So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.

23. And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.

24. And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?

25. And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD showed him a tree, which when he had cast it into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,

26. And said, If you will diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD your God, and will do that which is right in his sight, and will give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon you, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that heals you.

27. And they came to Elim, where there were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.

## Exodus 16

1. And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.

2. And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:

3. And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for you have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.

4. Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain portion every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or not.

5. And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.

6. And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At evening, then you shall know that the LORD has brought you out from the land of Egypt:

7. And in the morning, then you shall see the glory of the LORD; for he hears your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that you murmur against us?

8. And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for the LORD hears your murmurings which you murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.

9. And Moses spoke unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he has heard your murmurings.

10. And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.

11. And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,

12. I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At evening you shall eat flesh, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God.

13. And it came to pass, that at evening the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.

14. And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.

15. And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they knew not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.

16. This is the thing which the LORD has commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take every man for them who are in his tents.

17. And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.

18. And when they did measure it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.

19. And Moses said, Let no man leave any of it till the morning.

20. But they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left some of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was angry with them.

21. And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun grew hot, it melted.

22. And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.

23. And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD has said, Tomorrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which you will bake today, and boil that which you will boil; and that which remains over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.

24. And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm in it.

25. And Moses said, Eat that today; for today is a sabbath unto the LORD: today you shall not find it in the field.

26. Six days you shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.

27. And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day to gather, and they found none.

28. And the LORD said unto Moses, How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?

29. See, for the LORD has given you the sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide you every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.

30. So the people rested on the seventh day.

31. And the house of Israel called the name of it Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.

32. And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commands, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread with which I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.

33. And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna in it, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.

34. As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.

35. And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the border of the land of Canaan.

36. Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

## Exodus 17

1. And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and camped in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.

2. Therefore the people did strive with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why do you strive with me? why do you test the LORD?

3. And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why is this that you have brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?

4. And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they are almost ready to stone me.

5. And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with you of the elders of Israel; and your rod, with which you smote the river, take in your hand, and go.

6. Behold, I will stand before you there upon the rock in Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.

7. And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the striving of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?

8. Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.

9. And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.

10. So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.

11. And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

12. But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it; and Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.

13. And Joshua slaughtered Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.

14. And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.

15. And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it, The LORD is my banner:

16. For he said, Because the LORD has sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

## Exodus 18

1. When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;

2. Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,

3. And her two sons; of whom the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land:

4. And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:

5. And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:

6. And he said unto Moses, I your father-in-law Jethro am come unto you, and your wife, and her two sons with her.

7. And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.

8. And Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.

9. And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.

10. And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.

11. Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing in which they dealt proudly he was above them.

12. And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.

13. And it came to pass on the next day, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.

14. And when Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that you do to the people? why sit you yourself alone, and all the people stand by you from morning unto evening?

15. And Moses said unto his father-in-law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of God:

16. When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.

17. And Moses' father-in-law said unto him, The thing that you do is not good.

18. You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you: for this thing is too heavy for you; you are not able to perform it yourself alone.

19. Hearken now unto my voice, I will give you counsel, and God shall be with you: Represent the people before God, that you may bring the causes unto God:

20. And you shall teach them ordinances and laws, and shall show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.

21. Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:

22. And let them judge the people at all times: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto you, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for yourself, and they shall bear the burden with you.

23. If you shall do this thing, and God command you so, then you shall be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.

24. So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.

25. And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

26. And they judged the people at all times: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.

27. And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.

## Exodus 19

1. In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.

2. For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had camped in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.

3. And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shall you say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;

4. You have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.

5. Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a special treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:

6. And you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak unto the children of Israel.

7. And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.

8. And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD has spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD.

9. And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you forever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.

10. And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes,

11. And be ready by the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.

12. And you shall set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that you go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever touches the mount shall be surely put to death:

13. There shall not a hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mount.

14. And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.

15. And he said unto the people, Be ready by the third day: come not near your wives.

16. And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceedingly loud; so that all the people that were in the camp trembled.

17. And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the lower part of the mount.

18. And mount Sinai was completely in smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke of it ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.

19. And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.

20. And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.

21. And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.

22. And let the priests also, who come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.

23. And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for you charged us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.

24. And the LORD said unto him, Away, get down, and then you shall come up, you, and Aaron with you: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.

25. So Moses went down unto the people, and spoke unto them.

## Exodus 20

1. And God spoke all these words, saying,

2. I am the LORD your God, who has brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

3. You shall have no other gods before me.

4. You shall not make unto yourself any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:

5. You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;

6. And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.

7. You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain.

8. Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

9. Six days shall you labor, and do all your work:

10. But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD your God: in it you shall not do any work,you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger that is within your gates:

11. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day: therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

12. Honor your father and your mother: that your days may be long upon the land which the LORD your God gives you.

13. You shall not kill.

14. You shall not commit adultery.

15. You shall not steal.

16. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

17. You shall not covet your neighbor's house, you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor any thing that is your neighbor's.

18. And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they moved, and stood far off.

19. And they said unto Moses, Speak you with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.

20. And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God has come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that you sin not.

21. And the people stood far off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.

22. And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus you shall say unto the children of Israel, You have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.

23. You shall not make to be with me gods of silver, neither shall you make unto you gods of gold.

24. An altar of earth you shall make for me, and shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings, and your peace offerings, your sheep, and your oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto you, and I will bless you.

25. And if you will make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stone: for if you lift up your tool upon it, you have polluted it.

26. Neither shall you go up by steps unto my altar, that your nakedness be not exposed on it.

## Exodus 21

1. Now these are the judgments which you shall set before them.

2. If you buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.

3. If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he was married, then his wife shall go out with him.

4. If his master has given him a wife, and she has borne him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.

5. And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:

6. Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him forever.

7. And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.

8. If she please not her master, who has betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he has dealt deceitfully with her.

9. And if he has betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.

10. If he takes him another wife; her food, her clothing, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.

11. And if he does not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money.

12. He that strikes a man, so that he dies, shall be surely put to death.

13. And if a man lie not in wait, but God delivers him into his hand; then I will appoint you a place where he shall flee.

14. But if a man comes presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; you shall take him from my altar, that he may die.

15. And he that strikes his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.

16. And he that steals a man, and sells him, or if he is found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.

17. And he that curses his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.

18. And if men strive together, and one strikes another with a stone, or with his fist, and he dies not, but keeps his bed:

19. If he rises again, and walks about upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be clear: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shallcause him to be thoroughly healed.

20. And if a man strikes his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he dies under his hand; he shall be surely punished.

21. But, if he continues a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his property.

22. If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that there is a miscarriage, and yet no mischief follows: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.

23. And if any mischief follows, then you shall give life for life,

24. Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

25. Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

26. And if a man strikes the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.

27. And if he knocks out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.

28. If an ox gores a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be clear.

29. But if the ox were accustomed to gore with its horn in time past, and it has been testified to its owner, and he has not kept it in, but that it has killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death.

30. If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.

31. Whether it has gored a son, or has gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.

32. If the ox shall gore a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.

33. And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or a donkey fall in it;

34. The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.

35. And if one man's ox hurts another's, that it dies; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide.

36. Or if it be known that the ox was accustomed to gore in time past, and its owner has not kept it in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own.

## Exodus 22

1. If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.

2. If a thief be found breaking in, and be smitten that he dies, there shall no blood be shed for him.

3. If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.

4. If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or donkey, or sheep; he shall restore double.

5. If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his animal, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.

6. If fire breaks out, and catches in thorns, so that the stacks of grain, or the standing grain, or the field, be consumed ; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.

7. If a man shall deliver unto his neighbor money or goods to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay double.

8. If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, to see whether he has put his hand unto his neighbor's goods.

9. For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for donkey, for sheep, for clothing, or for any manner of lost thing, which another challenges to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbor.

10. If a man deliver unto his neighbor a donkey, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:

11. Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he has not put his hand unto his neighbor's goods; and the owner of it shall accept the oath, and he shall not make it good.

12. And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.

13. If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it as evidence, and he shall not make good that which was torn.

14. And if a man borrow anything of his neighbor, and it be hurt, or dies, the owner of itbeing not with it, he shall surely make it good.

15. But if the owner of it be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be a hired thing, it came for its hire.

16. And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.

17. If her father utterly refuses to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.

18. You shall not allow a witch to live.

19. Whosoever lies with an animal shall surely be put to death.

20. He that sacrifices unto any god, except unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.

21. You shall neither wrong a stranger, nor oppress him: for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.

22. You shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.

23. If you afflict them in any way, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;

24. And my wrath shall grow hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.

25. If you lend money to any of my people who is poor among you, you shall not be to him as a lender, neither shall you charge him interest.

26. If you at all take your neighbor's clothing as pledge, you shall deliver it unto him by the time the sun goes down:

27. For that is his only covering, it is his clothing for his skin: in what shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he cries unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.

28. You shall not revile God, nor curse the ruler of your people.

29. You shall not delay to offer the first of your ripe fruits, and of the outflow of your presses: the firstborn of your sons shall you give unto me.

30. Likewise shall you do with your oxen, and with your sheep: seven days it shall be with its mother; on the eighth day you shall give it to me.

31. And you shall be holy men unto me: neither shall you eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; you shall cast it to the dogs.

## Exodus 23

1. You shall not raise a false report: put not your hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.

2. You shall not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shall you testify in a dispute to followafter a crowd to pervert judgment:

3. Neither shall you be partial to a poor man in his cause.

4. If you meet your enemy's ox or his donkey going astray, you shall surely bring it back to him again.

5. If you see the donkey of him who hates you lying under its burden, and would refrain to help him, you shall surely help with him.

6. You shall not pervert the justice of your poor in his dispute.

7. Keep far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay you not: for I will not justify the wicked.

8. And you shall take no bribe: for the bribe blinds the wise, and perverts the words of the righteous.

9. Also you shall not oppress a stranger: for you know the heart of a stranger, seeing you were strangers in the land of Egypt.

10. And six years you shall sow your land, and shall gather in the fruits of it:

11. But the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie still; that the poor of your people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner you shall deal with your vineyard, and with your oliveyard.

12. Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest: that your ox and your donkey may rest, and the son of your handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.

13. And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of your mouth.

14. Three times you shall keep a feast unto me in the year.

15. You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread: (you shall eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded you, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it you came out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)

16. And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of your labors, which you have sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when you have gathered in your labors out of the field.

17. Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord GOD.

18. You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.

19. The first of the firstfruits of your land you shall bring into the house of the LORD your God. You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.

20. Behold, I send an Angel before you, to keep you in the way, and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.

21. Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.

22. But if you shall indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto your enemies, and an adversary unto your adversaries.

23. For my Angel shall go before you, and bring you in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.

24. You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but you shall utterly overthrow them, and completely break down their images.

25. And you shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless your bread, and your water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of you.

26. There shall nothing miscarry, nor be barren, in your land: the number of your days I will fulfill.

27. I will send my fear before you, and will destroy all the people to whom you shall come, and I will make all your enemies turn their backs unto you.

28. And I will send hornets before you, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before you.

29. I will not drive them out from before you in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beasts of the field multiply against you.

30. Little by little I will drive them out from before you, until you be increased, and inherit the land.

31. And I will set your bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and you shall drive them out before you.

32. You shall make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

33. They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against me: for if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto you.

## Exodus 24

1. And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, you, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, andseventy of the elders of Israel; and worship afar off.

2. And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come near; neither shall the people go up with him.

3. And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the ordinances: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD has said will we do.

4. And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.

5. And he sent young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD.

6. And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

7. And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the hearing of the people: and they said, All that the LORD has said will we do, and be obedient.

8. And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has made with you concerning all these words.

9. Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:

10. And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the very heaven in its clearness.

11. And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.

12. And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give you tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that you may teach them.

13. And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.

14. And he said unto the elders, Tarry you here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man has any matters to judge, let him come unto them.

15. And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.

16. And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.

17. And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.

18. And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and got him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.

1. And this is the thing that you shall do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto me in the priest's office: Take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish,

2. And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened mixed with oil, and wafers unleavened spread with oil: of wheat flour shall you make them.

3. And you shall put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams.

13. And you shall take all the fat that covers the entrails, and the fat that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.

14. But the flesh of the bullock, and its skin, and its dung, shall you burn with fire outside the camp: it is a sin offering.

15. You shall also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.

16. And you shall slay the ram, and you shall take its blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar.

17. And you shall cut the ram in pieces, and wash its entrails, and its legs, and put them with its pieces, and with its head.

18. And you shall burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet aroma, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

19. And you shall take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.

20. Then shall you kill the ram, and take of its blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.

21. And you shall take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.

22. Also you shall take of the ram the fat and the fat tail, and the fat that covers the entrails, and the fat above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration:

23. And one loaf of bread, and one cake of the bread with oil, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the LORD:

24. And you shall put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD.

25. And you shall receive them of their hands, and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet aroma before the LORD: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

26. And you shall take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be your part.

27. And you shall sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the thigh of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is raised, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:

28. And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute forever from the children of Israel: for it is a heave offering: and it shall be a heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave offering unto the LORD.

29. And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed in them, and to be consecrated in them.

30. And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he comes into the tabernacle of meeting to minister in the holy place.

31. And you shall take the ram of the consecration, and boil its flesh in the holy place.

32. And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, by the door of the tabernacle of meeting.

33. And they shall eat those things with which the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a foreigner shall not eat of them, because they are holy.

34. And if any of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.

35. And thus shall you do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded you: seven days shall you consecrate them.

36. And you shall offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and you shall cleanse the altar, when you have made an atonement for it, and you shall anoint it, to sanctify it.

37. Seven days you shall make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever touches the altar shall be holy.

38. Now this is that which you shall offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year, day by day continually.

39. The one lamb you shall offer in the morning; and the other lamb you shall offer in the evening:

40. And with the one lamb a tenth measure of flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten olive oil; and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink offering.

41. And the other lamb you shall offer at evening, and shall do to it according to the grain offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering, for a sweet aroma, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

42. This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of meeting before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto you.

43. And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.

44. And I will sanctify the tabernacle of meeting, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office.

45. And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.

46. And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the LORD their God.

## Exodus 30

1. And you shall make an altar to burn incense upon: of acacia wood shall you make it.

2. A cubit shall be the length of it, and a cubit the breadth of it; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height of it: its horns shall be of one piece with it.

3. And you shall overlay it with pure gold, the top of it, and the sides of it round about, and its horns; and you shall make unto it a molding of gold round about.

4. And two golden rings shall you make for it under its molding, by its two corners, upon the two sides of it shall you make it; and they shall be places for the poles with which to bear it.

5. And you shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.

6. And you shall put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with you.

7. And Aaron shall burn on it sweet incense every morning: when he tends the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.

8. And when Aaron lights the lamps at evening, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.

9. You shall offer no unholy incense on it, nor burnt sacrifice, nor grain offering; neither shall you pour a drink offering on it.

10. And Aaron shall make an atonement upon its horns once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto the LORD.

11. And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,

12. When you take the census of the children of Israel for their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when you number them; that there be no plague among them, when you number them.

13. This they shall give, every one that passes among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) a half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.

14. Every one included among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.

15. The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.

16. And you shall take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shall appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of meeting; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.

17. And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,

18. You shall also make a laver of bronze, and its base also of bronze, for washing: and you shall put it between the tabernacle of meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it.

19. For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet there:

20. When they go into the tabernacle of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:

21. So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute forever to them, even to him and to his descendants throughout their generations.

22. Moreover the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,

23. Take also unto you the finest spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet-smelling cinnamon half as much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet-smelling cane two hundred and fifty shekels,

24. And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin:

25. And you shall make it an oil of holy anointing, an ointment compounded after the art of the perfumer: it shall be a holy anointing oil.

26. And you shall anoint the tabernacle of meeting with it, and the ark of the testimony,

27. And the table and all its utensils, and the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense,

28. And the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the laver and its base.

29. And you shall sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever touches them shall be holy.

30. And you shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.

31. And you shall speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be a holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.

32. Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall you make any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you.

33. Whosoever compounds any like it, or whosoever puts any of it upon a foreigner, shall even be cut off from his people.

34. And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto you sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be the same amount:

35. And you shall make it an incense, a compound after the art of the perfumer, mixed together, pure and holy:

36. And you shall beat some of it very fine, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of meeting, where I will meet with you: it shall be unto you most holy.

37. And as for the incense which you shall make, you shall not make it for yourselves according to the composition of it: it shall be unto you holy for the LORD.

38. Whosoever shall make any like that, to smell it, shall even be cut off from his people.

## Exodus 31

1. And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,

2. See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:

3. And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,

4. To devise artistic works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze,

5. And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.

6. And I, behold, I have given with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and inthe hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you;

7. The tabernacle of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is on it, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,

8. And the table and its furniture, and the pure lampstand with all its furniture, and the altar of incense,

9. And the altar of burnt offering with all its furniture, and the laver and its foot,

10. And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,

11. And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded you shall they do.

12. And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,

13. Speak also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths you shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am the LORD that does sanctify you.

14. You shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defiles it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

15. Six days may work be done; but on the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever does any work on the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.

16. Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.

17. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.

18. And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of speaking with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.

## Exodus 32

1. And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, who shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what has become of him.

2. And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.

3. And all the people broke off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.

4. And he received them from their hand, and fashioned it with an engraving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.

5. And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, Tomorrow is a feast to the LORD.

6. And they rose up early on the next day, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.

7. And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get you down; for your people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:

8. They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, These are your gods, O Israel, who have brought you up out of the land of Egypt.

9. And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff-necked people:

10. Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may grow hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of you a great nation.

11. And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why does your wrath grow hot against your people, whom you have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?

12. Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from your fierce wrath, and change from this evil against your people.

13. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said unto them, I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your descendants, and they shall inherit it forever.

14. And the LORD turned from the evil which he thought to do unto his people.

15. And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.

16. And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved upon the tables.

17. And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.

18. And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.

19. And it came to pass, as soon as he came near unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger grew hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mount.

20. And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and scattered it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.

21. And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto you, that you have brought so great a sin upon them?

22. And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord grow hot: you know the people, that they are set on mischief.

23. For they said unto me, Make us gods, who shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what has become of him.

24. And I said unto them, Whosoever has any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it to me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.

25. And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had let them be naked unto their shame among their enemies:)

26. Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD'S side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.

27. And he said unto them, Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.

28. And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.

29. For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man upon the cost of his son, and his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.

30. And it came to pass on the next day, that Moses said unto the people, you have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin.

31. And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.

32. Yet now, if you will forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray you, out of your book which you have written.

33. And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.

34. Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto you: behold, my Angel shall go before you: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.

35. And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.

## Exodus 33

1. And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I swore unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto your descendants will I give it:

2. And I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:

3. Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of you; for you are a stiff-necked people: lest I consume you in the way.

4. And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.

5. For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, you are a stiff-necked people: I will come up into the midst of you in a moment, and consume you: therefore now put off your ornaments from you, that I may know what to do unto you.

6. And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.

7. And Moses took a tent, and pitched it outside the camp, far off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one who sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of meeting, which was outside the camp.

8. And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.

9. And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the LORD talked with Moses.

10. And all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshiped, every man in his tent door.

11. And the LORD spoke unto Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.

12. And Moses said unto the LORD, See, you say unto me, Bring up this people: and you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, I know you by name, and you have also found grace in my sight.

13. Now therefore, I pray you, if I have found grace in your sight, show me now your way, that I may know you, that I may find grace in your sight: and consider that this nation is your people.

14. And he said, My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest.

15. And he said unto him, If your presence go not with me, carry us not up from here.

16. For how shall it be known here that I and your people have found grace in your sight? is it not in that you go with us? so shall we be separated, I and your people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.

17. And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that you have spoken: for you have found grace in my sight, and I know you by name.

18. And he said, I beseech you, show me your glory.

19. And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before you; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.

20. And he said, You can not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.

21. And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand upon a rock:

22. And it shall come to pass, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand while I pass by:

23. And I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back: but my face shall not be seen.

## Exodus 34

1. And the LORD said unto Moses, Cut out two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which you broke.

2. And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me in the top of the mount.

3. And no man shall come up with you, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.

4. And he cut out two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.

5. And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.

6. And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,

7. Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.

8. And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.

9. And he said, If now I have found grace in your sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray you, go among us; for it is a stiff-necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.

10. And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among whom you are shall see the work of the LORD: for it is an awesome thing that I will do with you.

11. Observe that which I command you this day: behold, I drive out before you the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite,and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

12. Take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you go, lest it be for a snare in the midst of you:

13. But you shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their idol poles:

14. For you shall worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:

15. Lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go play the harlot after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call you, and you eat of his sacrifice;

16. And you take of their daughters unto your sons, and their daughters go play the harlot after their gods, and make your sons go play the harlot after their gods.

17. You shall make you no molten gods.

18. The feast of unleavened bread shall you keep. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt.

19. All that opens the womb is mine; and every firstling among your cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.

20. But the firstling of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb: and if you redeem it not, then shall you break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.

21. Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest: in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.

22. And you shall observe the feast of weeks, of the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.

23. Three times in the year shall all your male children appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel.

24. For I will cast out the nations before you, and enlarge your borders: neither shall any man desire your land, when you shall go up to appear before the LORD your God three times in the year.

25. You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.

26. The first of the firstfruits of your land you shall bring unto the house of the LORD your God. You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.

27. And the LORD said unto Moses, Write these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.

28. And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.

29. And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.

30. And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him.

31. And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.

32. And afterward all the children of Israel came near: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him on mount Sinai.

33. And till Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.

34. But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out. And he came out, and spoke unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.

35. And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.

## Exodus 35

1. And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD has commanded, that you should do them.

2. Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day it shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever does work on it shall be put to death.

3. You shall kindle no fire throughout your houses upon the sabbath day.

4. And Moses spoke unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,

5. Take from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and bronze,

6. And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,

7. And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and acacia wood,

8. And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,

9. And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate.

10. And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that the LORD has commanded;

11. The tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its clasps, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets,

12. The ark, and its poles, with the mercy seat, and the veil of the covering,

13. The table, and its poles, and all its utensils, and the showbread,

14. The lampstand also for the light, and its furniture, and its lamps, with the oil for the light,

15. And the incense altar, and its poles, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle,

16. The altar of burnt offering, with its bronze grate, its poles, and all its utensils, the laver and its base,

17. The hangings of the court, its pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court,

18. The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,

19. The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.

20. And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.

21. And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD'S offering to the work of the tabernacle of meeting, and for all its service, and for the holy garments.

22. And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and necklaces, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the LORD.

23. And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet stuff, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them.

24. Every one that did offer an offering of silver and bronze brought the LORD's offering: and every man, with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it.

25. And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.

26. And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats' hair.

27. And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate;

28. And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.

29. The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.

30. And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;

31. And he has filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;

32. And to devise artistic works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze,

33. And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of skillful work.

34. And he has put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.

35. Them has he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the skillful workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise artistic work.

## Exodus 36

1. Then Bezalel and Oholiab labored, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded.

2. And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:

3. And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.

4. And all the wise men, that were doing all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which he had made;

5. And they spoke unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.

6. And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.

7. For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.

8. And every wise hearted man among them that were doing the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of skillful work made he them.

9. The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.

10. And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another.

11. And he made loops of blue on the edge of the outmost curtain from the first set: likewise he made in the edge of the outmost curtain in the second set.

12. Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the second set: the loops held one curtain to another.

13. And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the clasps: so it became one tabernacle.

14. And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made.

15. The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.

16. And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.

17. And he made fifty loops upon the outmost edge of the curtain in the one set, and fifty loops he made upon the edge of the second connecting curtain.

18. And he made fifty clasps of bronze to couple the tent together, that it might be one.

19. And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers' skins above that.

20. And he made boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing upright.

21. The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half.

22. One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.

23. And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward:

24. And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.

25. And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north side, he made twenty boards,

26. And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.

27. And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.

20. And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of bronze.

21. This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest.

22. And Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.

## Exodus 39

1. And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.

2. And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

3. And they did hammer the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with skillful work.

4. They made shoulder pieces for it, to join it together: by the two edges was it joined together.

5. And the skillfully woven band of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same workmanship, according to its work; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.

6. And they worked onyx stones enclosed in settings of gold, engraved, as signets are engraved, with the names of the children of Israel.

7. And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.

8. And he made the breastplate of skillful work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

9. It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length of it, and a span the breadth of it, being doubled.

10. And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.

11. And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.

12. And the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst.

13. And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were enclosed in settings of gold in their mountings.

14. And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with its name, according to the twelve tribes.

15. And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of braided work of pure gold.

16. And they made two settings of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.

17. And they put the two braided chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate.

18. And the two ends of the two braided chains they fastened to the two settings, and put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod, in the front.

19. And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, in its edge, which was on the inside of the ephod.

20. And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the front of it, right at the seam, above the skillfully woven band of the ephod.

21. And they did bind the breastplate by its rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not come loose from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.

22. And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.

23. And there was a hole in the top of the robe, as the hole of a garment, with a band round about the hole, that it should not tear.

24. And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.

25. And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates on the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates;

26. A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses.

27. And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,

28. And a turban of fine linen, and exquisite caps of fine linen, and linen trousers of fine twined linen,

29. And a band of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.

30. And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.

31. And they tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten it high on the turban; as the LORD commanded Moses.

32. Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.

33. And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets,

34. And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the veil of the covering,

35. The ark of the testimony, and its poles, and the mercy seat,

36. The table, and all the utensils, and the showbread,

37. The pure lampstand, with its lamps, even with the lamps set in order, and all its utensils, and the oil for light,

38. And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet-smelling incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,

39. The bronze altar, and its grate of bronze, its poles, and all its utensils, the laver and its base,

40. The hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, its cords, and its pins, and all the utensils of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation,

41. The garments of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office.

42. According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work.

43. And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.

## Exodus 40

1. And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,

2. On the first day of the first month shall you set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

3. And you shall put in it the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the veil.

4. And you shall bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and you shall bring in the lampstand, and light its lamps.

5. And you shall set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.

6. And you shall set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

7. And you shall set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shall put water in it.

8. And you shall set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.

9. And you shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is in it, and shall hallow it, and all its utensils: and it shall be holy.

10. And you shall anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all its utensils, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.

11. And you shall anoint the laver and its base, and sanctify it.

12. And you shall bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of meeting, and wash them with water.

13. And you shall put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.

14. And you shall bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:

15. And you shall anoint them, as you did anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.

16. Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.

17. And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was raised up.

18. And Moses raised up the tabernacle, and fastened its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and raised up its pillars.

19. And he spread out the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent over it; as the LORD commanded Moses.

20. And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the poles on the ark, and put the mercy seat on top of the ark:

21. And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.

22. And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil.

23. And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.

24. And he put the lampstand in the tent of the congregation, opposite the table, on the south side of the tabernacle.

25. And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.

26. And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the veil:

27. And he burnt sweet-smelling incense on it; as the LORD commanded Moses.

28. And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.

29. And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the grain offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.

30. And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, for washing.

31. And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet there:

32. When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.

33. And he raised up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.

34. Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

35. And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode upon it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

36. And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:

37. But if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.

38. For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
