## Ezekiel 1

1. Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.

2. On the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachinâ€™s captivity,

3. The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.

4. And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire engulfing itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of its midst as the color of amber, out of the midst of the fire.

5. Also out of its midst came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.

6. And each one had four faces, and each one had four wings.

7. And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calfâ€™s foot: and they sparkled like the color of burnished bronze.

8. And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and the four had their faces and their wings.

9. Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went each one straight forward.

10. As for the likeness of their faces, the four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and the four had the face of an ox on the left side; the four also had the face of an eagle.

11. Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of each one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.

12. And they went each one straight forward: wherever the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.

13. As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches: they went back and forth among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.

14. And the living creatures ran back and forth like the appearance of a flash of lightning.

15. Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold, a wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, with its four faces.

16. The appearance of the wheels and their workings was like the color of beryl: and the four had the same likeness: and their appearance and their workings was, as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel.

17. When they went, they went in any of four directions: and they turned not when they went.

18. As for their rims, they were so high that they were awesome; and their rims were full of eyes, round about the four of them.

19. And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.

20. Wherever the spirit was to go, they went, there was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up with them: for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.

21. When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up along with them: for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.

22. And the likeness of the firmament above the heads of the living creature was as the color of awesome crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.

23. And under the firmament were their wings spread out straight, the one toward the other: each one had two, which covered on this side, and each one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.

24. And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of tumult, as the noise of an army: when they stood, they let down their wings.

25. And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.

26. And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.

27. And I saw as the color of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his waist even upward, and from the appearance of his waist even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.

28. As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke.

## Ezekiel 2

1. And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon your feet, and I will speak unto you.

2. And the Spirit entered into me when he spoke unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spoke unto me.

3. And he said unto me, Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.

4. For they are impudent children and stubborn. I do send you unto them; and you shall say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD.

5. And they, whether they will hear, or whether they refuse, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them.

6. And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you, and you do dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.

7. And you shall speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they refuse: for they are most rebellious.

8. But you, son of man, hear what I say unto you; Be not you rebellious like that rebellious house: open your mouth, and eat what I give you.

9. And when I looked, behold, a hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a scroll of a book was in it;

10. And he spread it before me; and it was written inside and outside: and there was written in it lamentations, and mourning, and woe.

## Ezekiel 3

1. Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that you find; eat this scroll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.

2. So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that scroll.

3. And he said unto me, Son of man, feed your belly, and fill your stomach with this scroll that I give you. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.

4. And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.

5. For you are not sent to a people of foreign speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;

6. Not to many people of foreign speech and of a hard language, whose words you can not understand. Surely, had I sent you to them, they would have hearkened unto you.

7. But the house of Israel will not hearken unto you; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hard-hearted.

8. Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads.

9. Like adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.

10. Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.

11. And go, get you to them of the captivity, unto the children of your people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus says the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they refuse.

12. Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a loud rumbling, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.

13. I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, and a noise of a loud rumbling.

14. So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.

15. Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.

16. And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

17. Son of man, I have made you a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.

18. When I say unto the wicked, You shall surely die; and you give him not warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at your hand.

19. Yet if you warn the wicked, and he turns not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.

20. Again, When a righteous man turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because you have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at your hand.

21. Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous sins not, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also you have delivered your soul.

22. And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you.

23. Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.

24. Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spoke with me, and said unto me, Go, shut yourself within your house.

25. But you, O son of man, behold, they shall put cords upon you, and shall bind you with them, and you shall not go out among them:

26. And I will make your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth, that you shall be dumb, and shall not be to them one who reproves: for they are a rebellious house.

27. But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; He that hears, let him hear; and he that refuses, let him refuse: for they are a rebellious house.

## Ezekiel 4

1. You also, son of man, take you a clay tablet, and lay it before you, and portray upon it the city, even Jerusalem:

2. And lay siege against it, and build a siege wall against it, and cast up a mound against it; set camps also against it, and place battering rams against it round about.

3. Moreover take unto you an iron plate, and set it for a wall of iron between you and the city: and set your face against it, and it shall be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.

4. Lie also upon your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that you shall lie upon it you shall bear their iniquity.

5. For I have laid upon you the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shall you bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.

6. And when you have accomplished them, lie again on your right side, and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed you each day for a year.

7. Therefore you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and your arm shall be uncovered, and you shall prophesy against it.

8. And, behold, I will put cords upon you, and you shall not turn yourself from one side to another, till you have ended the days of your siege.

9. Take also unto yourself wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make yourself bread of it, according to the number of the days that you shall lie upon your side, three hundred and ninety days shall you eat of it.

10. And your food which you shall eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shall you eat it.

11. You shall drink also water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time shall you drink.

12. And you shall eat it as barley cakes, and you shall bake it, using human waste, in their sight.

13. And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the nations, where I will drive them.

14. Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul has not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.

15. Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given you cowâ€™s dung for human waste, and you shall prepare your bread over it.

16. Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will cut off the supply of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and in dismay:

17. That they may lack bread and water, and be dismayed one with another, and waste away for their iniquity.

## Ezekiel 5

1. And you, son of man, take a sharp knife, take a barberâ€™s razor, and cause it to pass upon your head and upon your beard: then take balances to weigh and divide the hair.

2. You shall burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and you shall take a third part, and strike about it with a sword: and a third part you shall scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.

3. You shall also take some of them, and bind them in your garments.

4. Then take some of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; for from there shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.

5. Thus says the Lord GOD; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her.

6. And she has changed my ordinances into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her: for they have refused my ordinances and my statutes, they have not walked in them.

7. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Because you multiplied more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my ordinances, neither have done according to the ordinances of the nations that are round about you;

8. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am against you, and will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations.

9. And I will do in you that which I have not done, and the like of which I will not do any more, because of all your abominations.

10. Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments on you, and the whole remnant of you will I scatter into all the winds.

11. Therefore, as I live, says the Lord GOD; Surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things, and with all your abominations, therefore will I also diminish you; neither shall my eye spare, neither will I have any pity.

12. A third part of you shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of you: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about you; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.

13. Thus shall my anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.

14. Moreover I will make you a waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about you, in the sight of all that pass by.

15. So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about you, when I shall execute judgments on you in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken it.

16. When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will cut off your supply of bread:

17. So will I send upon you famine and wild beasts, and they shall bereave you; and pestilence and blood shall pass through you; and I will bring the sword upon you. I the LORD have spoken it.

## Ezekiel 6

1. And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,

3. And say, You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.

4. And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.

5. And I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.

6. In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and destroyed, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.

7. And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and you shall know that I am the LORD.

8. Yet will I leave a remnant, that you may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when you shall be scattered through the countries.

9. And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations where they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their adulterous heart, which has departed from me, and with their eyes, which play the harlot after their idols: and they shall loathe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.

10. And they shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.

11. Thus says the Lord GOD; Strike with your hand, and stamp with your foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.

12. He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remains and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.

13. Then shall you know that I am the LORD, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they did offer sweet incense to all their idols.

14. So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblah, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

## Ezekiel 7

1. Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

2. Also, you son of man, thus says the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end has come upon the four corners of the land.

3. Now has the end come upon you, and I will send my anger upon you, and will judge you according to your ways, and will recompense upon you all your abominations.

4. And my eye shall not spare you, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense your ways upon you, and your abominations shall be in the midst of you: and you shall know that I am the LORD.

5. Thus says the Lord GOD; An evil, a special evil, behold, has come.

6. An end has come, the end has come: it watches for you; behold, it has come.

7. The morning has come unto you, O you that dwell in the land: the time has come, the day of trouble is near, and not the rejoicing upon the mountains.

8. Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon you, and accomplish my anger upon you: and I will judge you according to your ways, and will recompense you for all your abominations.

9. And my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense you according to your ways and your abominations that are in the midst of you; and you shall know that I am the LORD that strikes.

10. Behold the day, behold, it has come: the morning has gone forth; the rod has blossomed, pride has budded.

11. Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither shall there be wailing for them.

12. The time has come, the day draws near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all their multitude.

13. For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision concerns the whole multitude, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.

14. They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goes to the battle: for my wrath is upon all their multitude.

15. The sword is outside, and the pestilence and the famine inside: he that is in the field shall die by the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.

16. But they that escape them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.

17. All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.

18. They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.

19. They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their stomachs: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.

20. As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things from it: therefore have I set it far from them.

21. And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for plunder, and to the wicked of the earth for spoil; and they shall pollute it.

22. My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.

23. Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.

24. Therefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.

25. Destruction comes; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.

26. Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumor shall be upon rumor; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.

27. The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

## Ezekiel 8

1. And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.

2. Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his waist even downward, fire; and from his waist even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the color of amber.

3. And he put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my hair; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looks toward the north; where the seat of the image of jealousy was, which provokes to jealousy.

4. And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the plain.

5. Then he said unto me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now in the way toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes in the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entrance.

6. He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, see you what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations.

7. And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.

8. Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had dug in the wall, behold a door.

9. And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.

10. So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about.

11. And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.

12. Then said he unto me, Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his idols? for they say, The LORD sees us not; the LORD has forsaken the land.

13. He said also unto me, Turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations that they do.

14. Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORDâ€™S house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.

15. Then said he unto me, Have you seen this, O son of man? turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations than these.

16. And he brought me into the inner court of the LORDâ€™S house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshiped the sun toward the east.

17. Then he said unto me, Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.

18. Therefore will I also deal in fury: my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.

## Ezekiel 9

1. He cried also in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.

2. And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lies toward the north, and every man a weapon for slaughter in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writerâ€™s inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the bronze altar.

3. And the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub, where it was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writerâ€™s inkhorn by his side;

4. And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that are done in its midst.

5. And to the others he said in my hearing, Go you after him through the city, and kill: let not your eye spare, neither have you pity:

6. Slay utterly old and young, both maidens, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the elders who were before the house.

7. And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go you forth. And they went forth, and killed in the city.

8. And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! will you destroy all the rest of Israel in your pouring out of your fury upon Jerusalem?

9. Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD has forsaken the land, and the LORD sees not.

10. And as for me also, my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will recompense their way upon their heads.

11. And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as you have commanded me.

## Ezekiel 10

1. Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubim there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.

2. And he spoke unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill your hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.

3. Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.

4. Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORDâ€™S glory.

5. And the sound of the cherubimâ€™s wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaks.

6. And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubim; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.

7. And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and went out.

8. And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a manâ€™s hand under their wings.

9. And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the color of a beryl stone.

10. And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.

11. When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.

12. And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that the four had.

13. As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.

14. And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.

15. And the cherubim were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.

16. And when the cherubim went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.

17. When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creatures was in them.

18. Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.

19. And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside them, and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORDâ€™S house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.

20. This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubim.

21. Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.

22. And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.

## Ezekiel 11

1. Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the LORDâ€™S house, which looks eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.

2. Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise iniquity, and give wicked counsel in this city:

3. Who say, It is not near for us to build houses: this city is the caldron, and we are the flesh.

4. Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.

5. And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus says the LORD; Thus have you said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, all of them.

6. You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets with the slain.

7. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.

8. You have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, says the Lord GOD.

9. And I will bring you out of its midst, and deliver you into the hands of foreigners, and will execute judgments among you.

10. You shall fall by the sword; I will judge you at the border of Israel; and you shall know that I am the LORD.

11. This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall you be the flesh in its midst; but I will judge you at the border of Israel:

12. And you shall know that I am the LORD: for you have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the nations that are round about you.

13. And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?

14. Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

15. Son of man, your brethren, even your brethren, the men of your kindred, and all the house of Israel entirely, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession.

16. Therefore say, Thus says the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the nations, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.

17. Therefore say, Thus says the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.

18. And they shall come there, and they shall take away all its detestable things and all its abominations from there.

19. And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within them; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh:

20. That they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.

21. But as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, says the Lord GOD.

22. Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.

23. And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.

24. Afterwards the Spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.

25. Then I spoke unto them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had shown me.

## Ezekiel 12

1. The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, who have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house.

3. Therefore, you son of man, prepare you belongings for moving, and move by day in their sight; and you shall move from your place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.

4. Then shall you bring forth your belongings by day in their sight, as belongings for moving: and you shall go forth at evening in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.

5. Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry out your belongings through it.

6. In their sight shall you bear it upon your shoulders, and carry it forth in the twilight: you shall cover your face, that you see not the ground: for I have set you for a sign unto the house of Israel.

7. And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my belongings by day, as belongings for captivity, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bore it upon my shoulder in their sight.

8. And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,

9. Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto you, What do you?

10. Say you unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among them.

11. Say, I am your sign: like I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall move and go into captivity.

12. And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to go out through it: he shall cover his face, so that he sees not the ground with his eyes.

13. My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.

14. And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him, and all his troops; and I will draw out the sword after them.

15. And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.

16. But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they come; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

17. Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

18. Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling and with anxiety;

19. And say unto the people of the land, Thus says the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with anxiety, and drink their water with dismay, that their land may be emptied from all who are in it, because of the violence of all them that dwell in it.

20. And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and you shall know that I am the LORD.

21. And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

22. Son of man, what is that proverb that you have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision fails?

23. Tell them therefore, Thus says the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision.

24. For there shall be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.

25. For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall no more be delayed: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, says the Lord GOD.

26. Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

27. Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of the times that are far off.

28. Therefore say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; There shall none of my words be delayed any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, says the Lord GOD.

## Ezekiel 13

1. And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say you unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear you the word of the LORD;

3. Thus says the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!

4. O Israel, your prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.

5. You have not gone up into the breaches, neither built up the wall for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.

6. They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD says: and the LORD has not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word.

7. Have you not seen a vain vision, and have you not spoken a lying divination, whenever you say, The LORD says it; although I have not spoken?

8. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Because you have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, says the Lord GOD.

9. And my hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the register of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

10. Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered mortar:

11. Say unto them which daub it with untempered mortar, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and you, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall break it.

12. Lo, when the wall has fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing with which you have daubed it?

13. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; I will even break it with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in my anger, and great hailstones in my fury to consume it.

14. So will I break down the wall that you have daubed with untempered mortar, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation shall be uncovered, and it shall fall, and you shall be consumed in its midst: and you shall know that I am the LORD.

15. Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered mortar, and will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;

16. That is, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, says the Lord GOD.

17. Likewise, you son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy you against them,

18. And say, Thus says the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew charms upon all wrists, and make veils for the heads, of every length, to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of my people, and will you save the souls alive that belong to you?

19. And will you profane me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies?

20. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against your charms, with which you hunt the souls there like birds, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the souls that you hunt like birds.

21. Your veils also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and you shall know that I am the LORD.

22. Because with lies you have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not turn from his wicked way, to save his life:

23. Therefore you shall see no more false visions, nor practice divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and you shall know that I am the LORD.

## Ezekiel 14

1. Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me.

2. And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

3. Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their faces: should I be inquired of at all by them?

4. Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that sets up his idols in his heart, and puts the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that comes according to the multitude of his idols;

5. That I may seize the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.

6. Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.

7. For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourns in Israel, who separates himself from me, and sets up his idols in his heart, and puts the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and comes to a prophet to inquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself:

8. And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and you shall know that I am the LORD.

9. And if the prophet is deceived when he has spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.

10. And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that inquired of him;

11. That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be defiled any more withall their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, says the Lord GOD.

12. The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,

13. Son of man, when the land sins against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out my hand upon it, and will break its supply of bread, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it:

14. Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver only their own souls by their righteousness, says the Lord GOD.

15. If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, so that it is desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts:

16. Though these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.

17. Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:

18. Though these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.

19. Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:

20. Though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, says the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall only deliver their own souls by their righteousness.

21. For thus says the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four severe judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the wild beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?

22. Yet, behold, in it shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and you shall see their way and their doings: and you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon it.

23. And they shall comfort you, when you see their ways and their doings: and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, says the Lord GOD.

## Ezekiel 15

1. And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, How is the wood of the vine tree better than any tree, or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest?

3. Shall wood be taken of it to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel on?

4. Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devours both the ends of it, and the middle of it is burned. Is it fit for any work?

5. Behold, when it was whole, it was fit for no work: how much less shall it be fit yet for any work, when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned?

6. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

7. And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and you shall know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.

8. And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, says the Lord GOD.

## Ezekiel 16

1. Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,

3. And say, Thus says the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Your birth and your nativity are from the land of Canaan; your father was an Amorite, and your mother a Hittite.

4. And as for your nativity, in the day you were born your navel was not cut, neither were you washed in water to cleanse you; you were not rubbed with salt at all, nor swaddled at all.

5. No eye pitied you, to do any of these unto you, to have compassion upon you; but you were cast out in the open field, and you were loathed, in the day that you were born.

6. And when I passed by you, and saw you polluted in your own blood, I said unto you when you were in your blood, Live; yea, I said unto you when you were in your blood, Live.

7. I have caused you to multiply as the bud of the field, and you have increased and become great, and you are come to excellent beauty: your breasts were formed, and your hair had grown, yet you were naked and bare.

8. Now when I passed by you, and looked upon you, behold, your time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over you, and covered your nakedness: yea, I swore unto you, and entered into a covenant with you, says the Lord GOD, and you became mine.

9. Then I washed you with water; yea, I thoroughly washed away your blood from you, and I anointed you with oil.

10. I clothed you also with embroidered work, and gave you sandals of badgersâ€™ skin, and I clothed you with fine linen, and I covered you with silk.

11. I adorned you also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon your hands, and a chain on your neck.

12. And I put a ring on your nose, and earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown upon your head.

13. Thus were you adorned with gold and silver; and your clothing was of fine linen, and silk, and embroidered work; you did eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and you were exceedingly beautiful, and you did prosper into a kingdom.

14. And your renown went forth among the nations for your beauty: for it was perfect through my splendor, which I had put upon you, says the Lord GOD.

15. But you did trust in your own beauty, and played the harlot because of your renown, and poured out your harlotry on every one that passed by; his it was.

16. And of your garments you did take, and adorned your high places with various colors, and played the harlot on them: the like things have never been, neither shall be.

17. You have also taken your fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made to yourself images of men, and did commit harlotry with them,

18. And took your embroidered garments, and covered them: and you have set my oil and my incense before them.

19. My food also which I gave you, fine flour, and oil, and honey, with which I fed you, you have even set it before them for a sweet aroma: and thus it was, says the Lord GOD.

20. Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne unto me, and these have you sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Is this act of your harlotries a small matter,

21. That you have slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them?

22. And in all your abominations and your harlotries you have not remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, and were polluted in your blood.

23. And it came to pass after all your wickedness, (woe, woe unto you! says the Lord GOD;)

24. That you have also built unto you an eminent place, and have made yourself a high place in every street.

25. You have built your high place at the head of every street, and have made your beauty to be abhorred, and have offered yourself to everyone that passed by, and multiplied your harlotries.

26. You have also played the harlot with the Egyptians your neighbors, strong in lust; and have increased your harlotries, to provoke me to anger.

27. Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over you, and have diminished your allowance of food, and delivered you unto the will of them that hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your lewd way.

28. You have played the harlot also with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; yea, you have played the harlot with them, and yet could not be satisfied.

29. You have moreover multiplied your harlotry with trading in the land of Chaldea; and yet you were not satisfied with this.

30. How weak is your heart, says the Lord GOD, seeing you do all these things, the work of a brazen harlot;

31. In that you build your shrine at the head of every street, and make your high place in every street; and have not been as a harlot, in that you scorned payment;

32. But as a wife that commits adultery, who takes strangers instead of her husband!

33. They give gifts to all harlots: but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and hire them, that they may come unto you on every side for your harlotry.

34. And you are different from other women in your harlotries, therefore none follows you to commit harlotries: and in that you give a reward, and no reward is given unto you, therefore you are different.

35. Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:

36. Thus says the Lord GOD; Because your filthiness was poured out, and your nakedness uncovered through your harlotries with your lovers, and with all the idols of your abominations, and by the blood of your children, which you did give unto them;

37. Behold, therefore I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have taken pleasure, and all them that you have loved, with all them that you have hated; I will even gather them round about against you, and will uncover your nakedness unto them, that they may see all your nakedness.

38. And I will judge you, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring blood upon you in fury and jealousy.

39. And I will also give you into their hand, and they shall throw down your shrine, and shall break down your high places: they shall strip you also of your clothes, and shall take your beautiful jewels, and leave you naked and bare.

40. They shall also bring up a company against you, and they shall stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their swords.

41. And they shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments upon you in the sight of many women: and I will cause you to cease from playing the harlot, and you also shall give no hire any more.

42. So will I make my fury toward you to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from you, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.

43. Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have enraged me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense your way upon your head, says the Lord GOD: and you shall not commit this lewdness in addition to all your abominations.

44. Behold, every one that uses proverbs shall use this proverb against you, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.

45. You are your motherâ€™s daughter, that loathes her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.

46. And your elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at your left hand: and your younger sister, that dwells at your right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.

47. Yet have you not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, you were corrupted more than they in all your ways.

48. As I live, says the Lord GOD, Sodom your sister has not done, she nor her daughters, as you have done, you and your daughters.

49. Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom, pride, fullness of food, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.

50. And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw fit.

51. Neither has Samaria committed half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters in all your abominations which you have done.

52. You also, who have judged your sisters, bear your own shame for your sins that you have committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than you: yea, be disgraced also, and bear your shame, in that you have justified your sisters.

53. When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of your captives in the midst of them:

54. That you may bear your own shame, and may be disgraced in all that you have done, in that you are a comfort unto them.

55. When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former state, then you and your daughters shall return to your former state.

56. For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride,

57. Before your wickedness was discovered, as at the time of your reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise you round about.

58. You have borne your lewdness and your abominations, says the LORD.

59. For thus says the Lord GOD; I will even deal with you as you have done, who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant.

60. Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish unto you an everlasting covenant.

61. Then you shall remember your ways, and be ashamed, when you shall receive your sisters, your elder and your younger: and I will give them unto you for daughters, but not by your covenant.

62. And I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall know that I am the LORD:

63. That you may remember, and be ashamed, and never open your mouth any more because of your shame, when I provide toward you an atonement for all that you have done, says the Lord GOD.

## Ezekiel 17

1. And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel;

3. And say, Thus says the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had various colors, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:

4. He cropped off the top of its young twigs, and carried it into a land of trade; he set it in a city of merchants.

5. He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow tree.

6. And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and its roots were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.

7. There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the bed of its planting.

8. It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a splendid vine.

9. Say, Thus says the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up its roots, and cut off its fruit, so that it withers? it shall wither in all its leaves of spring, not requiring great power or many people to pluck it up by its roots.

10. Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind touches it? it shall wither in the bed where it grew.

11. Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

12. Say now to the rebellious house, Know you not what these things mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon has come to Jerusalem, and has taken its king, and its princes, and led them with him to Babylon;

13. And has taken the kingâ€™s descendant, and made a covenant with him, and has taken an oath from him: he has also taken the mighty of the land:

14. That the kingdom might be humble, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.

15. But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and many people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that does such things? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?

16. As I live, says the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwells that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.

17. Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company help him in the war, by casting up siege mounds, and building walls, to cut off many persons:

18. Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and has done all these things, he shall not escape.

19. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; As I live, surely my oath that he has despised, and my covenant that he has broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head.

20. And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will execute judgment on him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me.

21. And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and you shall know that I the LORD have spoken it.

22. Thus says the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon a high and prominent mountain:

23. In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a splendid cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every sort; in the shadow of its branches shall they dwell.

24. And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done it.

## Ezekiel 18

1. The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,

2. What mean you, that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the childrenâ€™s teeth are set on edge?

3. As I live, says the Lord GOD, you shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.

4. Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sins, it shall die.

5. But if a man is just, and does that which is lawful and right,

6. And has not eaten upon the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither has defiled his neighborâ€™s wife, neither has come near a woman during her impurity,

7. And has not oppressed any, but has restored to the debtor his pledge, has robbed none by violence, has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment;

8. He that has not lent money for interest, neither has taken any increase, that has withdrawn his hand from iniquity, has executed true justice between man and man,

9. Has walked in my statutes, and has kept my judgments faithfully; he is just, he shall surely live, says the Lord GOD.

10. If he begets a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that does any one of these things,

11. And that does not any of those duties, but even has eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighborâ€™s wife,

12. Has oppressed the poor and needy, has robbed by violence, has not restored the pledge, and has lifted up his eyes to the idols, has committed abomination,

13. Has lent money for interest, and has taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.

14. Now, lo, if he begets a son, that sees all his fatherâ€™s sins which he has done, and considers, and does not the same,

15. That has not eaten upon the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, has not defiled his neighborâ€™s wife,

16. Neither has oppressed any, has not withheld the pledge, neither has robbed by violence, but has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment,

17. That has withheld his hand from the poor, that has not received from money interest nor increase, has executed my judgments, has walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.

18. As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.

19. Yet say you, Why? does not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son has done that which is lawful and right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he shall surely live.

20. The soul that sins, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.

21. But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he has committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.

22. All his transgressions that he has committed, they shall not be remembered against him: in his righteousness that he has done he shall live.

23. Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? says the Lord GOD: and not that he should turn from his ways, and live?

24. But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live? All his righteousness that he has done shall not be remembered: in his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that he has sinned, in them shall he die.

25. Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?

26. When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and dies in them; for his iniquity that he has done shall he die.

27. Again, when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.

28. Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.

29. Yet says the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?

30. Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, says the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.

31. Cast away from you all your transgressions, by which you have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will you die, O house of Israel?

32. For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dies, says the Lord GOD: therefore turn yourselves, and live.

## Ezekiel 19

1. Moreover take you up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,

2. And say, What is your mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her cubs among young lions.

3. And she brought up one of her cubs: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.

4. The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt.

5. Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her cubs, and made him a young lion.

6. And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men.

7. And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fullness thereof, by the noise of his roaring.

8. Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit.

9. And they put him in a cage in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon: they brought him in restraint, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.

10. Your mother is like a vine in your vineyard, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.

11. And she had strong rods for the scepters of them that bore rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.

12. But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.

13. And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground.

14. And fire has gone out of a rod of her branches, which has devoured her fruit, so that she has no strong rod to be a scepter to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.

## Ezekiel 20

1. And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and sat before me.

2. Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,

3. Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; Have you come to inquire of me? As I live, says the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.

4. Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:

5. And say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand unto the descendants of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up my hand unto them, saying, I am the LORD your God;

6. In the day that I lifted up my hand unto them, to bring them forth from the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands:

7. Then said I unto them, Cast you away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

8. But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.

9. But I acted for my nameâ€™s sake, that it should not be polluted before the nations, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.

10. Therefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.

11. And I gave them my statutes, and showed them my judgments, which if a man does, he shall even live by them.

12. Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctifies them.

13. But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man does, he shall even live by them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.

14. But I acted for my nameâ€™s sake, that it should not be polluted before the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.

15. Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;

16. Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.

17. Nevertheless my eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.

18. But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk you not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:

19. I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;

20. And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I am the LORD your God.

21. Yet the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if a man do, he shall even live by them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.

22. Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and acted for my nameâ€™s sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth.

23. I lifted up my hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries;

24. Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were fixed on their fathersâ€™ idols.

25. Therefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments by which they should not live;

26. And I defiled them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that opens the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the LORD.

27. Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.

28. For when I had brought them into the land, for I lifted up my hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet aroma, and poured out there their drink offerings.

29. Then I said unto them, What is the high place to which you go? And its name is called Bamah unto this day.

30. Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD; Are you defiled after the manner of your fathers? and commit you harlotry after their abominations?

31. For when you offer your gifts, when you make your sons to pass through the fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, says the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.

32. And that which comes into your mind shall not be at all, that you say, We will be as the Gentiles, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.

33. As I live, says the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:

34. And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries in which you are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out.

35. And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face.

36. Like I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I enter into judgment with you, says the Lord GOD.

37. And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:

38. And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and you shall know that I am the LORD.

39. As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord GOD; Go, serve everyone his idols, and hereafter also, if you will not hearken unto me: but defile my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.

40. For on my holy mountain, on the mountain height of Israel, says the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your offerings, with all your holy things.

41. I will accept you with your sweet aroma, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries in which you have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the nations.

42. And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for which I lifted up my hand in an oath to give it to your fathers.

43. And there shall you remember your ways, and all your doings, in which you have been defiled; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that you have committed.

44. And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I have dealt with you for my nameâ€™s sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O you house of Israel, says the Lord GOD.

45. Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

46. Son of man, set your face toward the south, and proclaim your word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;

47. And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned in it.

48. And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.

49. Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Does he not speak parables?

## Ezekiel 21

1. And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and proclaim your word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,

3. And say to the land of Israel, Thus says the LORD; Behold, I am against you, and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked.

4. Seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:

5. That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath: it shall not return any more.

6. Sigh therefore, you son of man, with breaking heart; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.

7. And it shall be, when they say unto you, Why sigh you? that you shall answer, For the tidings; because it comes: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it comes, and shall be brought to pass, says the Lord GOD.

8. Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

9. Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also polished:

10. It is sharpened to make a great slaughter; it is polished that it may flash like lightning: should we then make mirth? it despised the rod of my son, like every tree.

11. And he has given it to be polished, that it may be used: this sword is sharpened, and it is polished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.

12. Cry and wail, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it shall be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: strike therefore upon your thigh.

13. Because it is a trial, and what if the sword despise even the rod? it shall be no more, says the Lord GOD.

14. You therefore, son of man, prophesy, and strike your hands together, and let the sword strike twice, even the third time, the sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which enters into their private chambers.

15. I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made bright, it is polished for the slaughter.

16. Go you one way or the other, either on the right hand, or on the left, wherever your face is set.

17. I will also strike my hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said it.

18. The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,

19. Also, you son of man, mark you two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both of the two shall come forth out of one land: and choose you a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.

20. Mark the way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.

21. For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he shook his arrows, he consulted with images, he looked at the liver.

22. At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up a siege mound, and to build a wall.

23. And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.

24. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that you are come to remembrance, you shall be taken with the hand.

25. And you, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end,

26. Thus says the Lord GOD; Remove the turban, and take off the crown: this shall not remain the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high.

27. I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he comes whose right it is; and I will give it to him.

28. And you, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say, The sword, the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is polished, to consume because of the flashing:

29. While they see false visions for you, while they divine a lie unto you, to bring you upon the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day has come, when their iniquity shall have an end.

30. Shall I cause it to return into its sheath? I will judge you in the place where you were created, in the land of your nativity.

31. And I will pour out my indignation upon you, I will blow against you in the fire of my wrath, and deliver you into the hand of brutal men, skilful to destroy.

32. You shall be for fuel to the fire; your blood shall be in the midst of the land; you shall be no more remembered: for I the LORD have spoken it.

## Ezekiel 22

1. Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

2. Now, you son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? yea, you shall show her all her abominations.

3. Then say you, Thus says the Lord GOD, The city sheds blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and makes idols within herself to defile herself.

4. You have become guilty in your blood that you have shed; and have defiled yourself in your idols which you have made; and you have caused your days to draw near, and have come even unto your years: therefore have I made you a reproach unto the nations, and a mocking to all countries.

5. Those that are near, and those that are far from you, shall mock you, who are infamous and full of tumult.

6. Behold, the princes of Israel, each one in you used his power to shed blood.

7. In you have they made light of father and mother: in the midst of you have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in you have they wronged the fatherless and the widow.

8. You have despised my holy things, and have profaned my sabbaths.

9. In you are men that slander to shed blood: and in you they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of you they commit lewdness.

10. In you have they uncovered their fathersâ€™ nakedness: in you have they violated her that was set apart for her impurity.

11. And one has committed abomination with his neighborâ€™s wife; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law; and another in you has violated his sister, his fatherâ€™s daughter.

12. In you have they taken bribes to shed blood; you have taken interest and increase, and you have greedily gained from your neighbors by extortion, and have forgotten me, says the Lord GOD.

13. Behold, therefore I have struck my hands together at your dishonest gain which you have made, and at your blood which has been in the midst of you.

14. Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with you? I the LORD have spoken it, and will do it.

15. And I will scatter you among the nations, and disperse you in the countries, and will consume your filthiness out of you.

16. And you shall defile yourself in the sight of the nations, and you shall know that I am the LORD.

17. And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

18. Son of man, the house of Israel has to me become dross: all they are bronze, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver.

19. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Because you have all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.

20. As they gather silver, and bronze, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in my anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you.

21. Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and you shall be melted in its midst.

22. As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall you be melted in its midst; and you shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.

23. And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

24. Son of man, say unto her, You are the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.

25. There is a conspiracy of her prophets in her midst, like a roaring lion tearing the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in her midst.

26. Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned my holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and the common, neither have they shown difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.

27. Her princes in her midst are like wolves tearing the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.

28. And her prophets have daubed them with untempered mortar, seeing false visions, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus says the Lord GOD, when the LORD has not spoken.

29. The people of the land have used oppression, and committed robbery, and have oppressed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.

30. And I sought for a man among them, that should build up the wall, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.

31. Therefore have I poured out my indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, says the Lord GOD.

## Ezekiel 23

1. The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:

3. And they committed harlotries in Egypt; they committed harlotries in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they handled the breasts of their virginity.

4. And the names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bore sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.

5. And Oholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors,

6. Who were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.

7. Thus she committed her harlotries with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.

8. Neither left she her harlotries brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they handled the breasts of her virginity, and poured their harlotry upon her.

9. Therefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.

10. These uncovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became a byword among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.

11. And when her sister Oholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her lust than she, and in her harlotries more than her sister in her harlotries.

12. She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbors, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.

13. Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both the same way,

14. And that she increased her harlotries: for when she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion,

15. Girded with belts upon their waists, exceeding in flowing turbans upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:

16. And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.

17. And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their harlotry, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.

18. So she uncovered her harlotries, and uncovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like my mind was alienated from her sister.

19. Yet she multiplied her harlotries, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, in which she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.

20. For she doted upon her paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.

21. Thus you called to remembrance the lewdness of your youth, in handling of your breasts by the Egyptians for the sake of the bosom of your youth.

22. Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up your lovers against you, from whom your mind is alienated, and I will bring them against you on every side;

23. The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.

24. And they shall come against you with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, who shall set against you buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I commit set judgment unto them, and they shall judge you according to their judgments.

25. And I will set my jealousy against you, and they shall deal furiously with you: they shall take away your nose and your ears; and your remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take your sons and your daughters; and your survivors shall be devoured by the fire.

26. They shall also strip you out of your clothes, and take away your fine jewels.

27. Thus will I make your lewdness to cease from you, and your harlotry brought from the land of Egypt: so that you shall not lift up your eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt anymore.

28. For thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you hate, into the hand of them from whom your mind is alienated:

29. And they shall deal with you hatefully, and shall take away all the fruit of your labor, and shall leave you naked and bare: and the nakedness of your harlotries shall be uncovered, both your lewdness and your harlotries.

30. I will do these things unto you, because you have played the harlot after the nations, and because you are polluted with their idols.

31. You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore will I give her cup into your hand.

32. Thus says the Lord GOD; You shall drink of your sisterâ€™s cup deep and large: you shall be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it contains much.

33. You shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of horror and desolation, with the cup of your sister Samaria.

34. You shall even drink it and drain it out, and you shall break its sherds, and tear your own breasts: for I have spoken it, says the Lord GOD.

35. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Because you have forgotten me, and cast me behind your back, therefore bear you also your lewdness and your harlotries.

36. The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;

37. That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bore unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.

38. Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.

39. For when they had slain their children for their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of my house.

40. And furthermore, that you have sent for men to come from afar, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom you did wash yourself, painted your eyes, and decked yourself with ornaments,

41. And sat upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, upon which you have set my incense and my oil.

42. And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, who put bracelets upon their wrists, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.

43. Then said I unto her that had grown old in adulteries, Will they now commit harlotries with her, and she with them?

44. Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that plays the harlot: so went they in unto Oholah and unto Oholibah, the lewd women.

45. And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands.

46. For thus says the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company against them, and will give them to be removed and plundered.

47. And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.

48. Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.

49. And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and you shall bear the sins of your idols: and you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

## Ezekiel 24

1. Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD come unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, write you the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.

3. And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it:

4. Gather its pieces into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.

5. Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe its bones in it.

6. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is in it, and whose scum has not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.

7. For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;

8. That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.

9. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.

10. Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.

11. Then set it empty upon its coals, that the bronze of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be melted in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.

12. She has wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.

13. In your filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged you, and you were not purged, you shall not be purged from your filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon you.

14. I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I relent; according to your ways, and according to your doings, shall they judge you, says the Lord GOD.

15. Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

16. Son of man, behold, I take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke: yet neither shall you mourn nor weep, neither shall your tears run down.

17. Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the turban of your head upon you, and put on your shoes upon your feet, and cover not your lips, and eat not manâ€™s bread of sorrow.

18. So I spoke unto the people in the morning: and at evening my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.

19. And the people said unto me, Will you not tell us what these things are to us, that you so do?

20. Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

21. Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind shall fall by the sword.

22. And you shall do as I have done: you shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.

23. And your turban shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: you shall not mourn nor weep; but you shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.

24. Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he has done shall you do: and when this comes, you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

25. Also, you son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that upon which they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,

26. That he that escapes in that day shall come unto you, to cause you to hear it with your ears?

27. In that day shall your mouth be opened to him who has escaped, and you shall speak, and be no more dumb: and you shall be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

## Ezekiel 25

1. The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;

3. And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus says the Lord GOD; Because you said, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;

4. Behold, therefore I will deliver you to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their encampments in you, and make their dwellings in you: they shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk.

5. And I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels, and the Ammonites a resting place for flocks: and you shall know that I am the LORD.

6. For thus says the Lord GOD; Because you have clapped your hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all your disdain against the land of Israel;

7. Behold, therefore I will stretch out my hand upon you, and will deliver you for a plunder to the nations; and I will cut you off from the people, and I will cause you to perish out of the countries: I will destroy you; and you shall know that I am the LORD.

8. Thus says the Lord GOD; Because Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the nations;

9. Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from its cities which are on its frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim,

10. Unto the men of the east together with the Ammonites, and will give them as a possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.

11. And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

12. Thus says the Lord GOD; Because Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has greatly offended, and revenged itself upon them;

13. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out my hand against Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.

14. And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, says the Lord GOD.

15. Thus says the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a spiteful heart, to destroy for the old hatred;

16. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the seacoast.

17. And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.

## Ezekiel 26

1. And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, because that Tyre has said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken that was the gates of the people: she is turned over unto me: I shall be replenished, now she is laid waste:

3. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against you, as the sea causes its waves to come up.

4. And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.

5. It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken it, says the Lord GOD: and it shall become a plunder to the nations.

6. And her daughters who are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

7. For thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and many people.

8. He shall slay with the sword your daughters in the field: and he shall set up a siege wall against you, and cast a mound against you, and lift up a large shield against you.

9. And he shall set battering rams against your walls, and with his axes he shall break down your towers.

10. Because of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover you: your walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into your gates, as men enter into a city in which is made a breach.

11. With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all your streets: he shall slay your people by the sword, and your strong garrisons shall go down to the ground.

12. And they shall plunder your riches, and make a prey of your merchandise: and they shall break down your walls, and destroy your pleasant houses: and they shall lay your stones and your timber and your dust in the midst of the water.

13. And I will cause the noise of your songs to cease; and the sound of your harps shall be no more heard.

14. And I will make you like the top of a rock: you shall be a place to spread nets upon; you shall be rebuilt no more: for I the LORD have spoken it, says the Lord GOD.

15. Thus says the Lord GOD to Tyre; Shall not the coastlands shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of you?

16. Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their embroidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at every moment, and be astonished at you.

17. And they shall take up a lamentation for you, and say to you, How are you destroyed, that were inhabited by seafaring men, the renowned city, which was strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, who cause their terror to be on all that inhabit it!

18. Now shall the coastlands tremble in the day of your fall; yea, the coastlands that are by the sea shall be troubled at your departure.

19. For thus says the Lord GOD; When I shall make you a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon you, and great waters shall cover you;

20. When I shall bring you down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old, and shall set you in the lowest parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that you be not inhabited; and I shall give glory in the land of the living;

21. I will make you a terror, and you shall be no more: though you are sought for, yet shall you never be found again, says the Lord GOD.

## Ezekiel 27

1. The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

2. Now, you son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyre;

3. And say unto Tyre, O you that are situated at the entrance of the sea, which are a merchant of the people for many coastlands, Thus says the Lord GOD; O Tyre, you have said, I am of perfect beauty.

4. Your borders are in the midst of the seas, your builders have perfected your beauty.

5. They have made all your ship planks of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for you.

6. Of the oaks of Bashan have they made your oars; the company of Ashurites have made your planks of inlaid ivory, brought out of the coasts of Kittim.

7. Fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt was that which you spread forth to be your sail; blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah was that which covered you.

8. The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your mariners: your wise men, O Tyre, that were in you, were your pilots.

9. The elders of Gebal and its wise men were in you as your caulkers: all the ships of the sea with their oarsmen were in you to market your merchandise.

10. They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in your army, your men of war: they hung the shield and helmet in you; they set forth your splendor.

11. The men of Arvad with your army were upon your walls round about, and the Gammadim were in your towers: they hung their shields upon your walls round about; they have made your beauty perfect.

12. Tarshish was your merchant because of the multitude of all kinds of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in your wares.

13. Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of bronze in your market.

14. They of the house of Togarmah traded in your wares with horses and horsemen and mules.

15. The men of Dedan were your merchants; many coastlands were the markets of your hand: they brought you for a present tusks of ivory and ebony.

16. Syria was your merchant because of the multitude of the wares of your making: they traded in your wares with emeralds, purple, and embroidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.

17. Judah, and the land of Israel, they were your merchants: they traded in your market wheat from Minnith, and olives, and honey, and oil, and balm.

18. Damascus was your merchant in the multitude of the wares of your making, for the multitude of great wealth; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.

19. Dedan also and Javan going to and fro traded in your wares: wrought iron, cassia, and calamus, were in your market.

20. Dedan was your merchant in saddle blankets for riding.

21. Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they traded with you in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they your merchants.

22. The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were your merchants: they traded in your fairs with the best of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.

23. Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad, were your merchants.

24. These were your merchants in all sorts of things, in blue clothes, and embroidered work, and in rugs of many colors, bound with cords, and made secure, among your merchandise.

25. The ships of Tarshish were carriers for you in your market: and you were filled, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.

26. Your rowers have brought you into great waters: the east wind has broken you in the midst of the seas.

27. Your riches, and your wares, your merchandise, your mariners, and your pilots, your caulkers, and the traders of your merchandise, and all your men of war, that are in you, and in all your company which is in the midst of you, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of your ruin.

28. The pasture lands shall shake at the sound of the cry of your pilots.

29. And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land;

30. And shall cause their voice to be heard against you, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow in the ashes:

31. And they shall make themselves utterly bald for you, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for you with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing.

32. And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for you, and lament over you, saying, What city is like Tyre, like that destroyed in the midst of the sea?

33. When your wares went forth out on the seas, you filled many people; you did enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of your riches and of your merchandise.

34. In the time when you shall be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters your merchandise and all your company in the midst of you shall fall.

35. All the inhabitants of the coastlands shall be astonished at you, and their kings shall be greatly afraid, they shall be troubled in their countenance.

36. The merchants among the people shall hiss at you; you shall become a terror, and never shall be any more.

## Ezekiel 28

1. The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyre, Thus says the Lord GOD; Because your heart is lifted up, and you have said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet you are a man, and not God, though you set your heart as the heart of God:

3. Behold, you are wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from you:

4. With your wisdom and with your understanding you have gotten yourself riches, and have gotten gold and silver into your treasuries:

5. By your great wisdom and by your trade have you increased your riches, and your heart is lifted up because of your riches:

6. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Because you have set your heart as the heart of God;

7. Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon you, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom, and they shall defile your brightness.

8. They shall bring you down to the pit, and you shall die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas.

9. Will you yet say before him that slays you, I am a god? but you shall be a man, and no god, in the hand of him that slays you.

10. You shall die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, says the Lord GOD.

11. Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

12. Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyre, and say unto him, Thus says the Lord GOD; You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.

13. You have been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of your timbrels and of your pipes was prepared in you in the day that you were created.

14. You are the anointed cherub that covers; and I have set you so: you were upon the holy mountain of God; you have walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.

15. You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created, till iniquity was found in you.

16. By the multitude of your trade they have filled the midst of you with violence, and you have sinned: therefore I will cast you as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy you, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.

17. Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty, you have corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor: I will cast you to the ground, I will lay you before kings, that they may behold you.

18. You have defiled your sanctuaries by the multitude of your iniquities, by the iniquity of your trading; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of you, it shall devour you, and I will bring you to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold you.

19. All they that know you among the people shall be astonished at you: you shall be a horror, and never shall you be anymore.

20. Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

21. Son of man, set your face against Sidon, and prophesy against it,

22. And say, Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, O Sidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of you: and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.

23. For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

24. And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

25. Thus says the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations, then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob.

26. And they shall dwell safely in it, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I am the LORD their God.

## Ezekiel 29

1. In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt:

3. Speak, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster that lies in the midst of his rivers, who has said, My river is my own, and I have made it for myself.

4. But I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will cause the fish of your rivers to stick to your scales, and I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers, and all the fish of your rivers shall stick to your scales.

5. And I will leave you thrown into the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers: you shall fall upon the open fields; you shall not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given you for food to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven.

6. And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD, because they have been a staff of rod to the house of Israel.

7. When they took hold of you by your hand, you did break, and tear all their shoulders: and when they leaned upon you, you broke, and made all their backs to shake.

8. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword upon you, and cut off man and beast out of you.

9. And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I am the LORD: because he has said, The river is mine, and I have made it.

10. Behold, therefore I am against you, and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.

11. No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.

12. And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.

13. Yet thus says the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people among whom they were scattered:

14. And I will bring again the captives of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a lowly kingdom.

15. It shall be the lowest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.

16. And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which brings their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

17. And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

18. Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was rubbed raw: yet had he no wages, nor his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it:

19. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her wealth, and take her plunder; and it shall be the wages for his army.

20. I have given him the land of Egypt for his labor for which he served against it, because they wrought for me, says the Lord GOD.

21. In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to spring forth, and I will open your mouth to speak in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

## Ezekiel 30

1. The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord GOD; Wail, Alas for the day!

3. For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a cloudy day; it shall be the time for the nations.

4. And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.

5. Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mixed people, and Cub, and the men of the land that are in league, shall fall with them by the sword.

6. Thus says the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, says the Lord GOD.

7. And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.

8. And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and when all her helpers shall be destroyed.

9. In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the secure Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall come upon them, as in the day of Egypt: for, lo, it comes.

10. Thus says the Lord GOD; I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.

11. He and his people with him, the most terrible of the nations, shall be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.

12. And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is in it, by the hand of strangers: I the LORD have spoken it.

13. Thus says the Lord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause their images to cease out of Memphis; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.

14. And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments in No.

15. And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.

16. And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No shall be torn asunder, and Memphis shall have distresses daily.

17. The young men of Aven and of Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword: and these cities shall go into captivity.

18. At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.

19. Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

20. And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

21. Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a bandage to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword.

22. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.

23. And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.

24. And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaohâ€™s arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.

25. But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.

26. And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

## Ezekiel 31

1. And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom are you like in your greatness?

3. Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with forest shade, and of a high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.

4. The waters made it great, the deep set it up on high with its rivers running round about its plants, and sent out its little rivers unto all the trees of the field.

5. Therefore its height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and its boughs were multiplied, and its branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when it shot forth.

6. All the fowls of heaven made their nests in its boughs, and under its branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under its shadow dwelt all great nations.

7. Thus was it beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches: for its root reached to great waters.

8. The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it: the fir trees were not like its boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like its branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto it in its beauty.

9. I have made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied it.

10. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Because you have lifted up yourself in height, and it has shot up its top among the thick boughs, and its heart is lifted up in its height;

11. I have therefore delivered it into the hand of the mighty one of the nations; he shall surely deal with it: I have driven it out for its wickedness.

12. And strangers, the most terrible of the nations, have cut it off, and have left it: upon the mountains and in all the valleys its branches are fallen, and its boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth have gone down from its shadow, and have left it.

13. Upon its ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon its branches:

14. So that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their tops among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the lower parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.

15. Thus says the Lord GOD; In the day when it went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for it, and I restrained its floods, and the great waters were held back: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for it, and all the trees of the field fainted because of it.

16. I made the nations to shake at the sound of its fall, when I cast it down to sheol with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the lower parts of the earth.

17. They also went down into sheol with it with them that are slain with the sword; and they that were its arm, that dwelt under its shadow in the midst of the nations.

18. To whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shall you be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the lower parts of the earth: you shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord GOD.

## Ezekiel 32

1. And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, You are like a young lion of the nations, and you are as a monster in the seas: and you came forth with your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet, and fouled their rivers.

3. Thus says the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over you with a company of many people; and they shall bring you up in my net.

4. Then will I leave you upon the land, I will cast you forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon you, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with you.

5. And I will lay your flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with your dead bodies.

6. I will also water with your blood the land in which you swim, even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of you.

7. And when I shall put you out, I will cover the heaven, and make its stars dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light.

8. All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over you, and set darkness upon your land, says the Lord GOD.

9. I will also trouble the hearts of many people, when I shall bring your destruction among the nations, into the countries which you have not known.

10. Yea, I will make many people appalled at you, and their kings shall be horribly afraid of you, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of your fall.

11. For thus says the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon you.

12. By the swords of the mighty will I cause your multitude to fall, the most terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall plunder the pomp of Egypt, and all its multitude shall be destroyed.

13. I will destroy also all its beasts from beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.

14. Then will I make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, says the Lord GOD.

15. When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country shall be destitute of that of which it was full, when I shall strike all them that dwell in it, then shall they know that I am the LORD.

16. This is the lamentation with which they shall lament her: the daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for her, even for Egypt, and for all her multitude, says the Lord GOD.

17. It came to pass also in the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

18. Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the lower parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.

19. Whom do you surpass in beauty? go down, and be placed with the uncircumcised.

20. They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword: she is delivered to the sword: draw her and all her multitudes.

21. The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of sheol with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.

22. Asshur is there and all her company: their graves are about her: all of them slain, fallen by the sword:

23. Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land of the living.

24. There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who are gone down uncircumcised into the lower parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.

25. They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude: her graves are round about her: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: they are put in the midst of them that are slain.

26. There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitudes: their graves are round about them: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living.

27. And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, who have gone down to sheol with their weapons of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.

28. Yea, you shall be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shall lie with them that are slain with the sword.

29. There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, who with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.

30. There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down with the slain; with their terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit.

31. Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, says the Lord GOD.

32. For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord GOD.

## Ezekiel 33

1. Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man from their territory, and set him for their watchman:

3. If when he sees the sword come upon the land, he blows the trumpet, and warns the people;

4. Then whosoever hears the sound of the trumpet, and takes not warning; if the sword comes, and takes him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.

5. He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that takes warning shall deliver his soul.

6. But if the watchman sees the sword come, and blows not the trumpet, and the people are not warned; if the sword comes, and takes any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchmanâ€™s hand.

7. So you, O son of man, I have set you a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore you shall hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.

8. When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, you shall surely die; if you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at your hand.

9. Nevertheless, if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he does not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.

10. Therefore, O you son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus you speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we waste away in them, how should we then live?

11. Say unto them, As I live, says the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn you, turn you from your evil ways; for why will you die, O house of Israel?

12. Therefore, you son of man, say unto the children of your people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall by it in the day that he turns from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live because of his righteousness in the day that he sins.

13. When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trusts in his own righteousness, and commits iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he has committed, he shall die for it.

14. Again, when I say unto the wicked, You shall surely die; if he turns from his sin, and does that which is lawful and right;

15. If the wicked restores the pledge, gives back that which he has stolen, walks in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.

16. None of his sins that he has committed shall be mentioned unto him: he has done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.

17. Yet the children of your people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.

18. When the righteous turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, he shall even die for it.

19. But if the wicked turns from his wickedness, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall live by it.

20. Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O you house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.

21. And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.

22. Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, before he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.

23. Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

24. Son of man, they that inhabit those waste places of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for an inheritance.

25. Therefore say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; You eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall you possess the land?

26. You stand upon your sword, you work abomination, and you defile every one his neighborâ€™s wife: and shall you possess the land?

27. Say you thus unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the waste places shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that are in the strongholds and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.

28. For I will make the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through.

29. Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have made the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.

30. Also, you son of man, the children of your people still are talking against you by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, everyone to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that comes forth from the LORD.

31. And they come unto you as the people comes, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their covetousness.

32. And, lo, you are unto them as a very lovely song of one that has a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear your words, but they do them not.

33. And when this comes to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet has been among them.

## Ezekiel 34

1. And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?

3. You eat the fat, and you clothe yourselves with the wool, you kill them that are fed: but you feed not the flock.

4. The diseased have you not strengthened, neither have you healed those who were sick, neither have you bound up those who were broken, neither have you brought again those who were driven away, neither have you sought those who were lost; but with force and with cruelty have you ruled them.

5. And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and they became food to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.

6. My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after them.

7. Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;

8. As I live, says the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became food to every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock;

9. Therefore, O you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;

10. Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be food for them.

11. For thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search for my sheep, and seek them out.

12. As a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered on a cloudy and dark day.

13. And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country.

14. I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a rich pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.

15. I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, says the Lord GOD.

16. I will seek those who were lost, and bring again those who were driven away, and will bind up those who were broken, and will strengthen those who were sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.

17. And as for you, O my flock, thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, between the rams and the male goats.

18. Seems it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but must you tread down with your feet the rest of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but must you foul the rest with your feet?

19. And as for my flock, they eat that which you have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which you have fouled with your feet.

20. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and between the lean sheep.

21. Because you have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till you have scattered them abroad;

22. Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.

23. And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.

24. And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken it.

25. And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.

26. And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the showers to come down in their season; there shall be showers of blessing.

27. And the trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those who enslaved them.

28. And they shall no more be a prey to the nations, neither shall the beasts of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid.

29. And I will raise up for them a garden of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the nations any more.

30. Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them, and that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, says the Lord GOD.

31. And you my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, says the Lord GOD.

## Ezekiel 35

1. Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, set your face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,

3. And say unto it, Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I am against you, and I will stretch out my hand against you, and I will make you most desolate.

4. I will lay your cities waste, and you shall be desolate, and you shall know that I am the LORD.

5. Because you have had a perpetual hatred, and have shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity came to an end:

6. Therefore, as I live, says the Lord GOD, I will prepare you unto blood, and blood shall pursue you: since you have not hated blood, even blood shall pursue you.

7. Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passes out and him that returns.

8. And I will fill its mountains with its slain men: in your hills, and in your valleys, and in all your rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword.

9. I will make you perpetual desolations, and your cities shall not return: and you shall know that I am the LORD.

10. Because you have said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess them; although the LORD was there:

11. Therefore, as I live, says the Lord GOD, I will even do according to your anger, and according to your envy which you have used out of your hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged you.

12. And you shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard all your blasphemies which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given to us to consume.

13. Thus with your mouth you have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard them.

14. Thus says the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.

15. As you did rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto you: you shall be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Edom, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

## Ezekiel 36

1. Also, you son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD:

2. Thus says the Lord GOD; Because the enemy has said against you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession:

3. Therefore prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord GOD; Because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that you might be a possession unto the rest of the nations, and you are taken up by the lips of talkers, and are slandered by the people:

4. Therefore, you mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the rest of the nations that are round about;

5. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, which have given my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart, with spiteful minds, to cast it out to plunder.

6. Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because you have borne the shame of the nations:

7. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; I have lifted up my hand, Surely the nations that are about you, they shall bear their shame.

8. But you, O mountains of Israel, you shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are soon to come.

9. For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and you shall be tilled and sown:

10. And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be built:

11. And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you according to your former times, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings: and you shall know that I am the LORD.

12. Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess you, and you shall be their inheritance, and you shall no more bereave them of children.

13. Thus says the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, You land devours up men, and has bereaved your nation of children;

14. Therefore you shall devour men no more, neither bereave your nation of children any more, says the Lord GOD.

15. Neither will I cause men to hear in you the shame of the nations any more, neither shall you bear the reproach of the people any more, neither shall you cause your nation to fall any more, says the Lord GOD.

16. Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

17. Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.

18. Therefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols with which they had polluted it:

19. And I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.

20. And when they entered unto the nations, where they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the LORD, and have gone forth out of his land.

21. But I had pity because of my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations, where they went.

22. Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD; I do this not for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for my holy nameâ€™s sake, which you have profaned among the nations, where you went.

23. And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am the LORD, says the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.

24. For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.

25. Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.

26. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.

27. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and you shall keep my judgments, and do them.

28. And you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.

29. I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the grain, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.

30. And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that you shall receive no more reproach of famine among the nations.

31. Then shall you remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.

32. Not for your sakes do I this, says the Lord GOD, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel.

33. Thus says the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the ruins shall be rebuilt.

34. And the desolate land shall be tilled, instead of lying desolate in the sight of all that passed by.

35. And they shall say, This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities have become fortified, and are inhabited.

36. Then the nations that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD rebuild the ruined places, and replant that which was desolate: I the LORD have spoken it, and I will do it.

37. Thus says the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock.

38. As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

## Ezekiel 37

1. The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones,

2. And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.

3. And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, you know.

4. Again he said unto me, Prophesy to these bones, and say unto them, O you dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.

5. Thus says the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live:

6. And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you shall know that I am the LORD.

7. So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to its bone.

8. And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them over: but there was no breath in them.

9. Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus says the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.

10. So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceedingly great army.

11. Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off on our part.

12. Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.

13. And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,

14. And shall put my spirit in you, and you shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall you know that I the LORD have spoken it, and performed it, says the LORD.

15. The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

16. Moreover, you son of man, take you one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel, his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel, his companions:

17. And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in your hand.

18. And when the children of your people shall speak unto you, saying, Will you not show us what you mean by these?

19. Say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.

20. And the sticks on which you write shall be in your hand before their eyes.

21. And say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, where they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:

22. And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:

23. Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.

24. And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.

25. And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, in which your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell there, even they, and their children, and their childrenâ€™s children forever: and my servant David shall be their prince forever.

26. Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them forevermore.

27. My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

28. And the nations shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them forevermore.

## Ezekiel 38

1. And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

2. Son of man, set your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,

3. And say, Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:

4. And I will turn you back, and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you forth, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armor, even a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords:

5. Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and helmet:

6. Gomer, and all his hordes; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his hordes: and many people with you.

7. Be prepared, and prepare for yourself, you, and all your company that are assembled unto you, and be a guard for them.

8. After many days you shall be visited: in the latter years you shall come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always desolate: but they were brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them.

9. You shall ascend and come like a storm, you shall be like a cloud to cover the land, you, and all your hordes, and many people with you.

10. Thus says the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, that at the same time shall things come into your mind, and you shall think an evil thought:

11. And you shall say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,

12. To take plunder, and to carry off spoil; to turn your hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations, who have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.

13. Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all its villages, shall say unto you, Have you come to take plunder? have you gathered your company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?

14. Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus says the Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwell safely, shall you not know it?

15. And you shall come from your place out of the north parts, you, and many people with you, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army:

16. And you shall come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring you against my land, that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in you, O Gog, before their eyes.

17. Thus says the Lord GOD; Are you he of whom I have spoken in former times by my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days for many years that I would bring you against them?

18. And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, says the Lord GOD, that my fury shall come up in my face.

19. For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;

20. So that the fish of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.

21. And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, says the Lord GOD: every manâ€™s sword shall be against his brother.

22. And I will enter into judgment against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his hordes, and upon the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.

23. Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the LORD.

## Ezekiel 39

1. Therefore, you son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:

2. And I will turn you back, and leave but the sixth part of you, and will cause you to come up from the far north, and will bring you upon the mountains of Israel:

3. And I will strike your bow out of your left hand, and will cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand.

4. You shall fall upon the mountains of Israel, you, and all your hordes, and the people that are with you: I will give you unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.

5. You shall fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it, says the Lord GOD.

6. And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell securely in the coastlands: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

7. So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more: and the nations shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.

8. Behold, it is come, and it is done, says the Lord GOD; this is the day of which I have spoken.

9. And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the war clubs, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years:

10. So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they shall plunder those that plundered them, and rob those that robbed them, says the Lord GOD.

11. And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the travelers on the east of the sea: and it shall block the way of the travelers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call it The valley of Hamon-gog.

12. And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them, that they may cleanse the land.

13. Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, says the Lord GOD.

14. And they shall set apart men of continual employment, passing through the land to bury with the travelers those that remain upon the face of the land, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they make a search.

15. And the travelers that pass through the land, when any sees a manâ€™s bone, then shall they set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog.

16. And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they cleanse the land.

17. And, you son of man, thus says the Lord GOD; Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that you may eat flesh, and drink blood.

18. You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.

19. And you shall eat fat till you are full, and drink blood till you are drunk, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.

20. Thus you shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, says the Lord GOD.

21. And I will set my glory among the nations, and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.

22. So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God from that day and forward.

23. And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword.

24. According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them, and hidden my face from them.

25. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the captives of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name;

26. After they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses by which they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made them afraid.

27. When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemiesâ€™ lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;

28. Then shall they know that I am the LORD their God, who caused them to be led into captivity among the nations: but I have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them any more there.

29. Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, says the Lord GOD.

## Ezekiel 40

1. In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was captured, on the very same day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me there.

2. In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was a structure like a city on the south.

3. And he brought me there, and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring rod; and he stood in the gate.

4. And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart upon all that I shall show you; for to the intent that I might show them unto you are you brought here: declare all that you see to the house of Israel.

5. And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the manâ€™s hand a measuring rod of six cubits long by the cubit and a handbreadth: so he measured the width of the building, one rod; and the height, one rod.

6. Then came he unto the gate which looks toward the east, and went up its stairs, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one rod wide; and the other threshold of the gate, which was one rod wide.

7. And every little chamber was one rod long, and one rod wide; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the inside gate was one rod.

8. He measured also the porch of the inside gate, one rod.

9. Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inside.

10. And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; the three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.

11. And he measured the width of the entrance of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.

12. The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the little chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.

13. He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another: the width was five and twenty cubits, from door to door.

14. He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate.

15. And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.

16. And there were narrow windows in the little chambers, to their posts inside the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows were round about inside: and upon each post were palm trees.

17. Then he brought me into the outer court, and, lo, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement.

18. And the pavement by the side of the gates corresponding to the length of the gates was the lower pavement.

19. Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gate unto the front of the outside inner court, a hundred cubits eastward and northward.

20. And the gate of the outer court that faced the north, he measured its length, and its width.

21. And its little chambers were three on this side and three on that side; and its posts and arches were the same as the measure of the first gate: its length was fifty cubits, and its width five and twenty cubits.

22. And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were the same as the measure of the gate that looks toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and its arches were before them.

23. And the gate of the inner court was opposite the gate facing north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.

24. After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured its posts and arches according to these same measurements.

25. And there were windows in it and in its arches round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the width five and twenty cubits.

26. And there were seven steps to go up to it, and its arches were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon its posts.

27. And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits.

28. And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these same measurements;

29. And its little chambers, and its posts, and its arches, according to these same measurements: and there were windows in it and in its arches round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits wide.

30. And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits wide.

31. And its arches were toward the outer court; and palm trees were upon its posts: and the ascent to it had eight steps.

32. And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these same measurements.

33. And its little chambers, and its posts, and its arches, were according to these same measurements: and there were windows in it and in its arches round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits wide.

34. And its arches were toward the outer court; and palm trees were upon its posts, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.

35. And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according to these same measurements;

36. Its little chambers, its posts, and its arches, and the windows in it round about: the length was fifty cubits, and the width five and twenty cubits.

37. And its posts were toward the outer court; and palm trees were upon its posts, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.

38. And the chambers and its entrance were by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.

39. And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay on them the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering.

40. And on the outside, as one goes up to the entrance of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables.

41. Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, on which they slew their sacrifices.

42. And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high: on which also they laid the instruments with which they killed the burnt offering and the sacrifice.

43. And inside were hooks, a hand wide, fastened round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.

44. And outside the inner gate were the chambers for the singers in the inner court, one at the side of the north gate; facing toward the south: one at the side of the east gate facing toward the north.

45. And he said unto me, This chamber, facing toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers in charge of the house.

46. And the chamber facing toward the north is for the priests, the keepers in charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, who come near to the LORD to minister unto him.

47. So he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits wide, foursquare; and the altar that was in front of the house.

48. And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the width of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.

49. The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits; and he brought me by the steps by which they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.

## Ezekiel 41

1. Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits wide on the one side, and six cubits wide on the other side, which was the width of the tabernacle.

2. And the width of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured its length, forty cubits: and the width, twenty cubits.

3. Then went he inside, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the width of the door, seven cubits.

4. So he measured its length, twenty cubits; and its width, twenty cubits, beyond the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.

5. After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the width of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.

6. And the side chambers were three stories, one over another, and thirty in each story; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have support, but they were not supported by the wall of the house.

7. And the side chambers became wider as they ascended from story to story, corresponding to the enlargement of the offset from story to story round about the house; on the side of the house a stairway led upward, and thus one went up from the lowest story to the top story through the middle story.

8. I saw also an elevation of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers were a full rod of six great cubits.

9. The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber on the outside, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were inside.

10. And between the chambers was a width of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.

11. And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the width of the place that was left was five cubits round about.

12. Now the building that was facing the separate courtyard at the end toward the west was seventy cubits wide; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and its length ninety cubits.

13. So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate courtyard, and the building, with its walls, a hundred cubits long;

14. Also the width of the face of the house, and of the separate courtyard toward the east, a hundred cubits.

15. And he measured the length of the building opposite the separate courtyard which was behind it, and its galleries on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;

16. The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, opposite the door, paneled with wood round about, from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered;

17. To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and outside, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.

18. And it was made with cherubim and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces;

19. So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through all the house round about.

20. From the ground to above the door were cherubim and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple.

21. The posts of the temple were square, and also the face of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one like the appearance of the other.

22. The altar of wood was three cubits high, and its length two cubits; and its corners, and its length, and its walls, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the LORD.

23. And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.

24. And the doors had two leaves apiece, two swinging leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.

25. And there were carved on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, as were carved upon the walls; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch outside.

26. And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.

## Ezekiel 42

1. Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was opposite the separate courtyard, and which was opposite the building facing north.

2. Facing the length, which was a hundred cubits, was the north door, and the width was fifty cubits.

3. Opposite the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and facing the pavement which was for the outer court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.

4. And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits width toward the inside, at a distance of one cubit; and their doors faced north.

5. Now the upper chambers were narrower: for the galleries took more space away from these, than from the lower, and the middle chambers of the building.

6. For they were in three stories, but had not pillars like the pillars of the courts: therefore the upper chambers were narrowed, more than the lower and the middle chambers from the ground.

7. And the wall that was outside, opposite the chambers, toward the outer court at the front of the chambers, its length was fifty cubits.

8. For the length of the chambers that were on the outer court was fifty cubits: while those facing the temple were a hundred cubits.

9. And below these chambers was an entrance on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court.

10. There were chambers in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, opposite the separate courtyard, and opposite the building.

11. And the walk was before them, and they were like the appearance of the chambers which were facing the north, as long as they, and as wide as they: and all their exits were according to their plans, as were their doors.

12. And like the doors of the chambers that were facing the south there was a door in front of the walk, even the walk directly in front of the wall facing the east, as one enters them.

13. Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are opposite the separate courtyard, they are holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the grain offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.

14. When the priests enter them, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments in which they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people.

15. Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out through the gate which faces toward the east, and measured it round about.

16. He measured the east side with the measuring rod, five hundred rods, with the measuring rod all around.

17. He measured the north side, five hundred rods, with the measuring rod all around.

18. He measured the south side, five hundred rods, with the measuring rod.

19. He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred rods with the measuring rod.

20. He measured it on the four sides: it had a wall all around, five hundred rods long, and five hundred wide, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the common place.

## Ezekiel 43

1. Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looks toward the east:

2. And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.

3. And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.

4. And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate which faces toward the east.

5. So the Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.

6. And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me.

7. And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their harlotry, nor by the dead bodies of their kings on their high places.

8. In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: therefore I have consumed them in my anger.

9. Now let them put away their harlotry, and the dead bodies of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them forever.

10. You son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.

11. And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, show them the form of the house, and its plan, and its exits, and its entrances, and all its design, and all its ordinances, and all its forms, and all its laws: and write it in their sight, that they may keep its whole design, and all its ordinances, and do them.

12. This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole area round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.

13. And these are the measurements of the altar by cubits: The cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth; the base shall be a cubit high, and the width a cubit, and its rim all around its edge shall be a span: and this shall be the height of the altar.

14. And from the base upon the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the width one cubit; and from the smaller ledge even to the larger ledge shall be four cubits, and the width one cubit.

15. So the altar hearth shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth and extending upward shall be four horns.

16. And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve wide, square in the four corners.

17. And the ledge shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen wide on its four sides; and the rim around it shall be half a cubit wide; and its base shall be a cubit all around; and its steps shall face toward the east.

18. And he said unto me, Son of man, thus says the Lord GOD; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings on it, and to sprinkle blood on it.

19. And you shall give to the priests, the Levites, that are of the descendants of Zadok, who approach unto me, to minister unto me, says the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering.

20. And you shall take some of its blood, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the ledge, and upon the rim around it: thus shall you cleanse and purge it.

21. You shall take the bullock also of the sin offering, and shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, outside the sanctuary.

22. And on the second day you shall offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.

23. When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.

24. And you shall offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the LORD.

25. Seven days shall you prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.

26. Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves.

27. And when these days are completed, it shall be, that upon the eighth day, and thereafter, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, says the Lord GOD.

## Ezekiel 44

1. Then he brought me back to the gate of the outer sanctuary which faces toward the east; and it was shut.

2. Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.

3. It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the same way.

4. Then he brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the house: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD: and I fell upon my face.

5. And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with your eyes, and hear with your ears all that I say unto you concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all its laws; and mark well those who may enter the house, going out from the sanctuary.

6. And you shall say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD; O you house of Israel, let there be an end of all your abominations,

7. In that you have brought into my sanctuary foreigners, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when you offer my food, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.

8. And you have not kept charge of my holy things: but you have set others as keepers of my charge in my sanctuary instead of yourselves.

9. Thus says the Lord GOD; No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any foreigner that is among the children of Israel.

10. And the Levites who have gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, who went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity.

11. Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them.

12. Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, says the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity.

13. And they shall not come near unto me, to serve the office of a priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy place: but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.

14. But I will make them to keep charge of the house, for all its service, and for all that shall be done in it.

15. But the priests, the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, says the Lord GOD:

16. They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.

17. And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and inside.

18. They shall have linen turbans upon their heads, and shall have linen trousers upon their bodies; they shall not gird themselves with anything that causes sweat.

19. And when they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments in which they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.

20. Neither shall they shave their heads, nor allow their locks to grow long; they shall only trim the hair of their heads.

21. Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.

22. Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is divorced: but they shall take maidens of the descendants of the house of Israel, or a widow of a priest.

23. And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.

24. And in controversy they shall stand as judges; and they shall judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.

25. And they shall come near no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that has had no husband, they may defile themselves.

26. And after he is cleansed, they shall count unto him seven days.

27. And in the day that he goes into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, says the Lord GOD.

28. And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their inheritance: and you shall give them no possession in Israel: I am their possession.

29. They shall eat the grain offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.

30. And the first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every offering of all, of every sort of your offerings, shall be the priestâ€™s: you shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in your house.

31. The priests shall not eat of anything that is dead of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.

## Ezekiel 45

1. Moreover, when you shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, you shall offer a district unto the LORD, a holy portion of the land: the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand rods, and the width shall be ten thousand. This shall be holy in all its territory all around.

2. Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length, with five hundred in width, square all around; and fifty cubits round about for its open space.

3. And of this measure shall you measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the width of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place.

4. The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister unto the LORD: and it shall be a place for their houses, and a holy place for the sanctuary.

5. And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of width, shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession for cities to live in.

6. And you shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand wide, and five and twenty thousand long, adjacent to the district of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.

7. And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the district of the holy portion, and of the possession of the city, bordering the district of the holy portion, and bordering the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length shall correspond to one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border.

8. In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes.

9. Thus says the Lord GOD; Enough, O princes of Israel: remove violence and plunder, and execute justice and righteousness, take away your evictions of my people, says the Lord GOD.

10. You shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.

11. The ephah and the bath shall be the same measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth part of a homer: the measure of it shall be according to the homer.

12. And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your mina.

13. This is the offering that you shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of wheat, and you shall give the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of barley:

14. Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, you shall offer the tenth part of a bath from a cor, which is a homer of ten baths; for ten baths are a homer:

15. And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the rich pastures of Israel; for a grain offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, says the Lord GOD.

16. All the people of the land shall give this offering for the prince in Israel.

17. And it shall be the princeâ€™s part to give burnt offerings, and grain offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all appointed feasts of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the grain offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.

18. Thus says the Lord GOD; In the first month, in the first day of the month, you shall take a young bullock without blemish, and cleanse the sanctuary:

19. And the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering, and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.

20. And so you shall do the seventh day of the month for every one that sins through error or in ignorance: so shall you reconcile the house.

21. In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.

22. And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering.

23. And the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering.

24. And he shall prepare a grain offering of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil for each ephah.

25. In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the same in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the grain offering, and according to the oil.

## Ezekiel 46

1. Thus says the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that faces the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.

2. And the prince shall enter by way of the porch of that gate from outside, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go out; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.

3. Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD on the sabbaths and on the new moons.

4. And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD on the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.

5. And the grain offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the grain offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and a hin of oil to each ephah.

6. And on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish.

7. And he shall prepare a grain offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as much as he is able, and a hin of oil to each ephah.

8. And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go out by the same way.

9. But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that enters in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that enters by the way of the south gate shall go out by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate by which he came in, but shall go out opposite it.

10. And the prince shall be in the midst of them, and when they go in, he shall go in; and when they go out, he shall go out.

11. And at the feasts and at the appointed seasons the grain offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as much as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to each ephah.

12. Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then open him the gate that faces toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go out; and after his going out one shall shut the gate.

13. You shall daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a lamb of the first year without blemish: you shall prepare it every morning.

14. And you shall prepare a grain offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour; a grain offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the LORD.

15. Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the grain offering, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering.

16. Thus says the Lord GOD; If the prince gives a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance of it shall be his sonsâ€™; it shall be their possession by inheritance.

17. But if he gives a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; afterward it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sonsâ€™, for them.

18. Moreover the prince shall not take any of the peopleâ€™s inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.

19. After that he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which faced toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward.

20. Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the grain offering; that they bear them not out into the outer court, to sanctify the people.

21. Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.

22. In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty wide: these four corners were of the same measure.

23. And there was a row of building stones all around in them, all around the four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows of stones all around.

24. Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifices of the people.

## Ezekiel 47

1. Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the front of the house faced toward the east, and the waters came down from under the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar.

2. Then he brought me out by way of the north gate, and led me around the way outside to the outer gate by the way that faces eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.

3. And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were up to the ankles.

4. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the waist.

5. Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over.

6. And he said unto me, Son of man, have you seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river.

7. Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.

8. Then he said unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the waters of the sea shall be healed.

9. And it shall come to pass, that everything that lives, which moves, wherever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come there: for they shall be healed; and everything shall live where the river comes.

10. And it shall come to pass, that the fishermen shall stand upon it from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim; there shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be the same kinds as the fish of the great sea, exceedingly many.

11. But its swamps and its marshes shall not be healed; they shall be given over to salt.

12. And by the river upon its bank, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for food, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall its fruit be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to its months, because the waters flowed out of the sanctuary: and its fruit shall be for food, and its leaf for medicine.

13. Thus says the Lord GOD; This shall be the borders, by which you shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.

14. And you shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.

15. And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the road to Hethlon, as men go to Zedad;

16. Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazar-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran.

17. And the border from the sea shall be to Hazar-enan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And this is the north side.

18. And the east side you shall measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by the Jordan, from the border unto the east sea. And this is the east side.

19. And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of strife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the south side southward.

20. The west side also shall be the great sea from the border, till one comes opposite Hamath. This is the west side.

21. So shall you divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.

22. And it shall come to pass, that you shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, who shall bare children among you: and they shall be unto you as if born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.

23. And it shall come to pass, that in whatever tribe the stranger sojourns, there shall you give him his inheritance, says the Lord GOD.

## Ezekiel 48

1. Now these are the names of the tribes. From the north border along the road to Hethlon, as one enters Hamath, to Hazar-enan, the border of Damascus northward, in the direction of Hamath; for these are the sides east and west; a portion for Dan.

2. And by the border of Dan, from the east side to the west side, a portion for Asher.

3. And by the border of Asher, from the east side even to the west side, a portion for Naphtali.

4. And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side to the west side, a portion for Manasseh.

5. And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side to the west side, a portion for Ephraim.

6. And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even to the west side, a portion for Reuben.

7. And by the border of Reuben, from the east side to the west side, a portion for Judah.

8. And by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the district which you shall offer of five and twenty thousand rods in width, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side unto the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it.

9. The district that you shall offer unto the LORD shall be of five and twenty thousand in length, and of ten thousand in width.

10. And for them, even for the priests, shall be this holy district; toward the north five and twenty thousand in length, and toward the west ten thousand in width, and toward the east ten thousand in width, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the LORD shall be in the midst of it.

11. It shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok; who have kept my charge, who went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.

12. And this district of the land that is offered shall be unto them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites.

13. And opposite the border of the priests the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in width: all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the width ten thousand.

14. And they shall not sell any of it, neither exchange, nor alienate the firstfruits of the land: for it is holy unto the LORD.

15. And the five thousand, that are left in the width opposite the five and twenty thousand, shall be an ordinary area for the city, for dwelling, and for common land: and the city shall be in the midst of it.

16. And these shall be its measurements; the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred.

17. And the common land of the city shall be to the north two hundred and fifty, and to the south two hundred and fifty, and to the east two hundred and fifty, and to the west two hundred and fifty.

18. And the rest in length alongside the district of the holy portion shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward: and it shall be adjacent to the district of the holy portion; and its increase shall be for food unto them that serve the city.

19. And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel.

20. All the district shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: you shall set apart the holy district as a square, with the possession of the city.

21. And the rest shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy district, and of the possession of the city, next to the five and twenty thousand of the district toward the east border, and westward next to the five and twenty thousand toward the west border, adjacent to the portions for the prince: and it shall be the holy district; and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst of it.

22. Moreover apart from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, being in the midst of that which is the princeâ€™s, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, shall be for the prince.

23. As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side to the west side, Benjamin shall have a portion.

24. And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west side, Simeon shall have a portion.

25. And by the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side, Issachar a portion.

26. And by the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west side, Zebulun a portion.

27. And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the west side, Gad a portion.

28. And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of strife in Kadesh, and to the river toward the great sea.

29. This is the land which you shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their portions, says the Lord GOD.

30. And these are the exits of the city on the north side, four thousand and five hundred cubits by measure.

31. And the gates of the city shall be according to the names of the tribes of Israel: three gates northward; one gate for Reuben, one gate for Judah, one gate for Levi.

32. And on the east side four thousand and five hundred: and three gates; and one gate for Joseph, one gate for Benjamin, one gate for Dan.

33. And on the south side four thousand and five hundred cubits by measure: and three gates; one gate for Simeon, one gate for Issachar, one gate for Zebulun.

34. At the west side four thousand and five hundred, with their three gates; one gate for Gad, one gate for Asher, one gate for Naphtali.

35. It was all around eighteen thousand cubits by measure: and the name of the city from that day shall be, The LORD is there.
