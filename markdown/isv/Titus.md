# Titus

## Titus 1

__so that the man of God may be complete and thoroughly equipped for every good work.__

1. From Paul, a servant of God, and yet an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of God's elect and the full knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness,

2. which is based on the hope of eternal life that God, who cannot lie, promised before the world began.

3. At the right time he revealed his message through the proclamation that was entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior.

4. To Titus, a genuine child in the faith we share. May grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior be yours!

5. The reason I left you in Crete was to complete what still needed to be done and to appoint elders in every city, as I myself commanded you.

6. An elder must be blameless. He must be the husband of one wife and have children who are believers and who are not accused of having wild lifestyles or of being rebellious.

7. Because an overseer is God's administrator, he must be blameless. He must not be arrogant or irritable. He must not drink too much, be a violent person, or use shameful ways to make money.

8. Instead, he must be a lover of strangers, a lover of goodness, sensible, honest, moral, and self-controlled.

9. He must be devoted to the trustworthy message that is in agreement with our teaching, so that he may be able to encourage others with healthy doctrine and refute those who oppose it.

10. For there are many people who are rebellious, especially those who are converts from Judaism. They speak utter nonsense and deceive people.

11. They must be silenced, because they are the kind of people who ruin whole families by teaching what they should not teach in order to make money in a shameful way.

12. One of their very own prophets said,	“Liars ever, men of Crete,Savage brutes that live to eat.”

13. That testimony is true. For this reason, refute them sharply so that they may become healthy in the faith

14. and not pay attention to Jewish myths or commands given by people who reject the truth.

15. Everything is clean to those who are clean, but nothing is clean to those who are corrupt and unbelieving. Indeed, their very way of thinking and their consciences have been corrupted.

16. They claim to know God, but they deny him by their actions. They are detestable, disobedient, and disqualified to do anything good.

## Titus 2

1. But as for you, teach what is consistent with healthy doctrine.

2. Older men are to be sober, serious, sensible, and sound in faithfulness, love, and endurance.

3. Likewise, older women are to show their reverence for God by their behavior. They are not to be gossips or addicted to alcohol, but to be examples of goodness.

4. They should encourage the younger women to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children,

5. sensible, pure, managers of their households, and kind, and to submit themselves to their husbands, lest the word of God be discredited.

6. Likewise, encourage the younger men to be sensible.

7. Always set an example of good works. When you teach, show integrity and dignity.

8. Use wholesome speech that cannot be condemned. Then any opponent will be ashamed because he cannot say anything bad about us.

9. Slaves are to submit themselves to their masters in everything, aiming to please them and not argue with them

10. or steal from them. Instead, they are to show complete and perfect loyalty, so that in every way they may make the teaching about God our Savior more attractive.

11. For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people.

12. It trains us to renounce ungodly living and worldly passions so that we might live sensible, honest, and godly lives in the present world

13. as we wait for the blessed hope and the glorious appearance of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.

14. He gave himself for us to set us free from every wrong and to cleanse us so that we could be his special people who are enthusiastic about good works.

15. These are the things you should say. Encourage and refute with full authority. Do not let anyone look down on you.

## Titus 3

1. Remind believers to submit themselves to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, and to be ready to do any honorable kind of work.

2. They are not to insult anyone or be argumentative. Instead, they are to be gentle and show perfect courtesy to everyone.

3. After all, we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, and misled. We were slaves to many kinds of lusts and pleasures, spending our days in malice and jealousy. We were despised, and we hated one another.

4. However,	In grace our Savior God appeared,His love for mankind to make clear.

5. ‘Twas not for deeds that we had done, But by his steadfast love alone,	He saved us through a second birth,Renewed us by the Spirit's work,

6. And poured him out upon us, too,Through Jesus Christ our Savior true.

7. And so, made right by his own grace,Eternal life we now embrace.

8. This saying is trustworthy. I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have put their faith in God may devote themselves to good works. These things are good and helpful to other people.

9. But avoid foolish controversies, arguments about genealogies, quarrels, and fights about the law. These things are useless and worthless.

10. Have nothing to do with a person who causes divisions after you have warned him once or twice.

11. For you know that a person like this is corrupt and keeps on sinning, being self-condemned.

12. As soon as I send Artemas to you, or perhaps Tychicus, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.

13. Do all you can to send Zenas the expert in the law and Apollos on their way, and see that they have everything they need.

14. Our own people should also learn to devote themselves to good works when urgent needs arise, lest they be unproductive.

15. All who are with me send you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. May grace be with all of you! Amen.
