# 1 Peter

## 1 Peter 1

__Therefore, anyone who knows what is right but fails to do it is guilty of sin.__

1. From Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the exiles of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,

2. the people chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through the sanctifying work of the Spirit to be obedient to Jesus Christ and to be sprinkled with his blood. May grace and peace be yours in abundance!

3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! Because of his great mercy he has given us a new birth to an ever-living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead

4. and to an inheritance kept in heaven for you that can't be destroyed, corrupted, or changed.

5. Through faith you are being protected by God's power for a salvation that is ready to be revealed at the end of time.

6. In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you have to suffer various kinds of trials,

7. so that the genuineness of your faith, which is more valuable than gold that perishes when it is tested by fire, may result in praise, glory, and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.

8. Though you have not seen him, you love him. And even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy,

9. because you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls.

10. Even the prophets, who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours, carefully researched and investigated this salvation.

11. They tried to find out what era or specific time the Spirit of Christ in them kept referring to when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow.

12. It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you in regard to the things that have now been announced to you by those who brought you the good news through the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. These are things that even the angels desire to look into.

13. Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep a clear head, and set your hope completely on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed.

14. As obedient children, do not be shaped by the desires that you once had in your ignorance.

15. Instead, just as the one who called you is holy, be holy in every aspect of your life.

16. For it is written, “You must be holy, because I am holy.”

17. If you call “Father” the one who judges everyone impartially according to what he has done, you must live in the fear of the Lord as long as you are strangers here.

18. For you know that it was not with perishable things like silver or gold that you have been ransomed from the worthless way of life handed down to you by your ancestors,

19. but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or defect.

20. On the one hand, he was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but on the other hand, he was revealed at the end of time for your sake.

21. Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope might be in God.

22. Now that you have obeyed the truth and have purified your souls to love your brothers sincerely, you must love one another intensely and with a pure heart.

23. For you have been born again, not by a seed that perishes but by one that cannot perish—by the living and everlasting word of God.

24. For	“All human life is like grass,and all its glory is like a flower in the grass.	The grass dries up and the flower drops off,

25. but the word of the Lord lasts forever.”Now this word is the good news that was announced to you.

## 1 Peter 2

1. Therefore, rid yourselves of every kind of evil and deception, hypocrisy, jealousy, and every kind of slander.

2. Like newborn babies, thirst for the pure milk of the word so that by it you may grow in your salvation.

3. Surely you have tasted that the Lord is good!

4. As you come to him, the living stone who was rejected by people but was chosen and precious in God's sight,

5. you, too, as living stones, are building yourselves up into a spiritual house and a holy priesthood, so that you may offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.

6. This is why it says in Scripture:	“Look! I am laying a chosenand precious cornerstone in Zion.			The one who believes in him will never be ashamed.”

7. Therefore he is precious to you who believe, but to those who do not believe,	“The stone that the builders rejectedhas become the cornerstone,

8. a stone they stumble over and a rock they trip on.”They keep on stumbling because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.

9. But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people to be his very own and to proclaim the wonderful deeds of the one who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.

10. Once you were not a people,but now you are the people of God.	Once you had not received mercy,but now you have received mercy.

11. Dear friends, I urge you as aliens and exiles to keep on abstaining from the desires of the flesh that wage war against the soul.

12. Continue to live such upright lives among the Gentiles that, when they slander you as evildoers, they may see your good works and glorify God when he visits them in judgment.

13. For the Lord's sake submit yourselves to every human authority: whether to the king as supreme,

14. or to governors who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right.

15. For it is God's will that by doing right you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people.

16. Live like free people, and do not use your freedom as an excuse for doing evil. Instead, be God's servants.

17. Show honor to everyone. Keep on loving the brothers, fearing God, and honoring the king.

18. You household servants must submit yourselves to your masters with all fear, not only to those who are kind and fair, but also to those who are unjust.

19. For it is a fine thing if, when moved by your conscience to please God, you suffer patiently when wronged.

20. What credit is it if you sin and patiently receive a beating for it? But if you suffer for doing good and take it patiently, you have God's approval.

21. This is, in fact, what you were called to do, because Christ also suffered for you and left an example for you to follow in his steps.

22. “He never committed a sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.”

23. When he was insulted, he did not retaliate. When he suffered, he did not threaten but made it his habit to commit the matter to the one who judges fairly.

24. He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to those sins and live for righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.

25. For you were like sheep that kept going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

## 1 Peter 3

1. In a similar way, you wives must submit yourselves to your husbands so that, even if some of them refuse to obey the word, they may be won over without a word through your conduct as wives

2. when they see your pure and reverent lives.

3. Your beauty should not be an external one, consisting of braided hair or the wearing of gold ornaments and dresses.

4. Instead, it should be the inner disposition of the heart, consisting in the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great value in the sight of God.

5. After all, this is how holy women who set their hope on God used to make themselves beautiful in the past. They submitted themselves to their husbands,

6. just as Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him lord. You have become her daughters by doing good and by not letting anything terrify you.

7. In a similar way, you husbands must live with your wives in an understanding manner, as with a most delicate vessel. Honor them as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing may interfere with your prayers.

8. Finally, all of you must live in harmony, be sympathetic, love as brothers, and be compassionate and humble.

9. Do not pay others back evil for evil or insult for insult. Instead, bless them, because you were called to inherit a blessing.

10. For	“the person who wants to love lifeand see good days	must keep his tongue from eviland his lips from speaking deceit.

11. He must turn away from evil and do good.He must seek peace and pursue it.

12. For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,and his ears are attentive to their prayer.	But the face of the Lord is against those who do wrong.”

13. Who will harm you if you are devoted to doing what is good?

14. But even if you should suffer for doing what is right, you are blessed. Never be afraid of their threats, and never get upset.

15. Instead, exalt Christ as Lord in your hearts. Always be prepared to give a defense to everyone who asks you to explain the hope you have.

16. But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak evil of your good conduct in Christ will be ashamed of slandering you.

17. After all, if it is the will of God, it is better to suffer for doing right than for doing wrong.

18. For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, an innocent person for the guilty, so that he could bring you to God. He was put to death in the sphere of the flesh but was made alive in the sphere of the spirit,

19. in which he went and made a proclamation to those imprisoned spirits

20. who disobeyed long ago in the days of Noah, when God waited patiently while the ark was being built. In it a few, that is, eight persons, were saved by water.

21. Baptism, which is symbolized by that water, now saves you also, not by removing dirt from the body, but by asking God for a clear conscience based on the resurrection of Jesus Christ,

22. who has gone to heaven and is at the right hand of God, where angels, authorities, and powers have been made subject to him.

## 1 Peter 4

1. Therefore, since Christ suffered in the sphere of the flesh, you, too, must arm yourselves with the same determination. For the person who has suffered in the sphere of the flesh has stopped sinning,

2. so that he can live the rest of his time in the flesh guided, not by human desires, but by the will of God.

3. For you spent enough time in the past doing what the Gentiles like to do, living in sensuality, sinful desires, drunkenness, wild celebrations, drinking parties, and detestable idolatry.

4. They insult you now because they are surprised that you are no longer joining them in the same excesses of wild living.

5. They will give an account to the one who is ready to judge the living and the dead.

6. Indeed, this is why the gospel was proclaimed even to those who have died, so that they could be judged in the realm of the flesh like all humans and live in the realm of the spirit like God.

7. The end of everything is near; so be sensible and clear-headed for the sake of your prayers.

8. Above all, continue to love each other deeply, because love covers a multitude of sins.

9. Show hospitality to one another without complaining.

10. As good managers of God's grace in its various forms, serve one another with the gift each of you has received.

11. Whoever speaks must speak God's words. Whoever serves must serve with the strength that God supplies, so that in every way God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. Glory and power belong to him forever and ever! Amen.

12. Dear friends, do not be surprised by the fiery ordeal that is taking place among you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.

13. Instead, because you are participating in the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing, so that you may be glad and shout for joy when his glory is revealed.

14. If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the glorious Spirit of God is resting on you.

15. Of course, none of you should suffer for being a murderer, thief, criminal, or troublemaker.

16. But if you suffer for being a Christian, do not feel ashamed, but glorify God with that name.

17. For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God. And if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who refuse to obey the gospel of God?

18. “If it is hard for the righteous person to be saved,what will happen to the ungodly and sinful person?”

19. So then, those who suffer according to God's will should entrust their souls to a faithful Creator and continue to do what is good.

## 1 Peter 5

1. Therefore, as a fellow elder, a witness of Christ's sufferings, and one who shares in the glory to be revealed, I appeal to the elders among you:

2. Be shepherds of God's flock that is among you, watching over it, not because you must but because you want to, and not greedily but eagerly, as God desires.

3. Do not lord it over the people entrusted to you, but be examples to the flock.

4. Then, when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the victor's crown of glory that will never fade away.

5. In a similar way, you young people must be submissive to the elders. All of you must put on the apron of humility before one another, because	“God opposes the arrogant,but gives grace to the humble.”

6. Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, so that at the proper time he may exalt you.

7. Throw all your worry on him, because he cares for you.

8. Be clear-minded and alert. Your opponent the devil is prowling around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.

9. Resist him and be firm in the faith, because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering.

10. After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you in Christ Jesus to his eternal glory, will restore you, establish you, strengthen you, and support you.

11. Power belongs to him forever and ever! Amen.

12. Through Silvanus, whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written this short letter to encourage you and to testify that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it!

13. Your sister church in Babylon, chosen along with you, sends you greetings, as does my son Mark.

14. Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to all of you who are in Christ!
