# Philippians

## Philippians 1

__But each individual man among you must love his wife as he loves himself; and may the wife fear her husband.__

1. From Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the holy ones in Philippi who are united with Christ Jesus, with their overseers and deacons.

2. May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be yours!

3. I thank my God every time I remember you,

4. always praying with joy in every one of my prayers for all of you

5. because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now.

6. I am convinced of this, that the one who began a good work among you will bring it to completion by the day of Christ Jesus.

7. For it is only right for me to think this way about all of you, because I have you in my heart. Both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, all of you are partners with me in grace.

8. For God is my witness how much I long for all of you with the compassion of Christ Jesus.

9. And this is my prayer, that your love will keep on growing more and more in full knowledge and perfect insight,

10. so that you may be able to determine what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ,

11. having been filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.

12. Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has actually turned out for the progress of the gospel.

13. As a result, it has become clear to the whole imperial guard and to everyone else that I am in prison because of Christ.

14. Moreover, because of my imprisonment most of the brothers have been made confident in the Lord to speak God's word more boldly and courageously than ever before.

15. Some are preaching Christ because of their envy and rivalry, while others do so because of their good will.

16. The latter are motivated by love, because they know that I have been appointed for the defense of the gospel.

17. The former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition and without sincerity, thinking that they will stir up trouble for me during my imprisonment.

18. But what does it matter? Just this, that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is being proclaimed, and because of this I rejoice. Yes, I will continue to rejoice,

19. because I know that this will result in my deliverance through your prayers and the help that comes from the Spirit of Jesus Christ.

20. This is according to my eager expectation and hope that I will have nothing to be ashamed of. Instead, because of my boldness Christ will be exalted in my body, now as always, whether I live or die.

21. For to me, to go on living is Christ, and to die is gain.

22. Now if I go on living in this body, that will produce more results, yet I do not know which I would prefer.

23. Indeed, I cannot decide between the two. I have the desire to leave this life and be with Christ, for that is far better.

24. But for your sake it is better that I remain in this body.

25. Since I am convinced of this, I know that I will continue to live and be with all of you for the sake of your progress and joy in the faith.

26. Then your boasting in Christ Jesus will increase along with mine through my coming again to you.

27. The only thing that matters is that you continue to live as good citizens in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come to see you or whether I stay away, I may hear all about you—that you are standing firm in one spirit, struggling with one mind for the faith of the gospel,

28. and that you are not intimidated by your opponents in any way. This is evidence that they will be destroyed and that you will be saved—and all because of God.

29. For you have been given the privilege for Christ's sake not only to believe in him but also to suffer for him.

30. You have the same struggle that you saw in me and now hear that I am still having.

## Philippians 2

1. Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any comfort of love, if there is any fellowship in the Spirit, if there is any compassion and sympathy,

2. then fill me with joy by having the same attitude, sharing the same love, being united in spirit, and keeping one purpose in mind.

3. Do not act out of selfish ambition or conceit, but with humility think of others as being better than yourselves.

4. Do not be concerned about your own interests, but also be concerned about the interests of others.

5. Have the same attitude among yourselves that was also in Christ Jesus:

6. In God's own form existed he,And shared with God equality,Deemed nothing needed grasping.

7. Instead, poured out in emptiness,A servant's form did he possess,A mortal man becoming.	In human form he chose to be,

8. And lived in all humility,Death on a cross obeying.

9. Now lifted up by God to heaven,A name above all others given,This matchless name possessing.

10. And so, when Jesus’ name is called,The knees of everyone should fallWhere'er they are residing.

11. Then every tongue in one accord,Will say that Jesus Christ is Lord,While God the Father praising.

12. And so, my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not only when I was with you but even more now that I am absent, continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.

13. For it is God who is producing in you both the desire and the ability to do what pleases him.

14. Do everything without complaining or arguing

15. so that you may be blameless and innocent, God's children without any faults among a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine like stars in the world

16. as you hold out the word of life. Then I can boast in the day of Christ that I did not run in vain or work hard in vain.

17. Yet even if I am being poured out like an offering as part of the sacrifice and service I offer for your faith, I rejoice, and I share my joy with all of you.

18. In the same way, you also should rejoice and share your joy with me.

19. Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon so that I can be encouraged when I learn of your condition.

20. I do not have anyone else like him who takes a genuine interest in your welfare.

21. For all the others look after their own interests, not after those of Jesus Christ.

22. But you know his proven worth—how like a son with his father he served with me in the gospel.

23. Therefore, I hope to send him as soon as I see how things are going to turn out for me.

24. Indeed, I am confident in the Lord that I will come to visit you soon.

25. Meanwhile, I thought it best to send Epaphroditus—my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, but your messenger and minister to my need—back to you.

26. For he has been longing for all of you and is troubled because you heard that he was sick.

27. Indeed, he was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, so that I would not have one sorrow on top of another.

28. Therefore, I am especially eager to send him so that you may have the joy of seeing him again, and so that I may feel relieved.

29. So welcome him in the Lord with all joy, and make sure you honor such people highly.

30. For he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me.

## Philippians 3

1. So then, my brothers, keep on rejoicing in the Lord. It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you; indeed, it is for your safety.

2. Beware of the dogs! Beware of the evil workers! Beware of the mutilators!

3. For it is we who are the circumcision—we who worship in the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus. We have not placed any confidence in the flesh,

4. although I could have confidence in the flesh. If anyone thinks he can place confidence in the flesh, I have more reason to think so.

5. Having been circumcised on the eighth day, I am of the nation of Israel, from the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews. As far as the law is concerned, I was a Pharisee.

6. As far as zeal is concerned, I was a persecutor of the church. As far as the righteousness that is in the law is concerned, I was perfect.

7. But whatever things were assets to me, these I now consider a loss for the sake of Christ.

8. What is more, I continue to consider all these things as a loss for the sake of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. It is because of him that I have experienced the loss of all those things. Indeed, I consider them rubbish in order to gain Christ

9. and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but one that comes through the faithfulness of Christ, the righteousness that comes from God and that depends on faith.

10. I want to know Christ—what his resurrection power is like and what it means to share in his sufferings by becoming like him in his death,

11. though I hope to experience the resurrection from the dead.

12. It's not that I have already reached this goal or have already become perfect. But I keep pursuing it, hoping somehow to embrace it just as I have been embraced by Christ Jesus.

13. Brothers, I do not consider myself to have embraced it. But this one thing I do: Forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,

14. I keep pursuing the goal to win the prize of God's heavenly call in Christ Jesus.

15. Therefore, those of us who are mature should think this way. And if you think differently about anything, God will show you how to think.

16. However, we should live up to what we have achieved so far.

17. Join together in imitating me, brothers, and pay close attention to those who live by the example we have given you.

18. For I have often told you, and now tell you even with tears, that many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.

19. Their destiny is destruction, their god is their belly, and their glory is in their shame. Their minds are set on worldly things.

20. Our citizenship, however, is in heaven, and it is from there that we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.

21. He will change our humble bodies and make them like his glorious body through the power that enables him to bring everything under his authority.

## Philippians 4

1. Therefore, my dear brothers whom I long for, my joy and my victor's crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, dear friends.

2. I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to have the same attitude in the Lord.

3. Yes, I also ask you, my true partner, to help these women. They have struggled with me in the gospel along with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life.

4. Keep on rejoicing in the Lord at all times. I will say it again: Keep on rejoicing!

5. Let your forbearing spirit be known to all people.The Lord is near:

6. Never worry about anything, but in every situation let your petitions be made known to God in prayers and requests, with thanksgiving.

7. Then God's peace, which goes far beyond anything we can imagine, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.

8. Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is fair, whatever is pure, whatever is acceptable, whatever is commendable, if there is anything of excellence and if there is anything praiseworthy—keep thinking about these things.

9. Likewise, keep practicing these things: what you have learned, received, heard, and seen in me. Then the God of peace will be with you.

10. Now I rejoice in the Lord greatly, because once again you have shown your concern for me. Of course, you were concerned for me but you did not have an opportunity to show it.

11. I am not saying this because I am in any need, for I have learned to be content in whatever situation I am in.

12. I know how to be humble, and I know how to prosper. In each and every situation I have learned the secret of being full and of going hungry, of having too much and of having too little.

13. I can do all things through him who strengthens me.

14. Nevertheless, it was kind of you to share my troubles.

15. You Philippians also know that in the early days of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church participated with me in the matter of giving and receiving except for you.

16. Even while I was in Thessalonica, you provided for my needs not once, but twice.

17. It is not that I am looking for a gift. No, I am looking for the profit that accumulates to your account.

18. I have been paid in full and have more than enough. I am fully supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus what you sent—a fragrant aroma, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.

19. And my God will fully supply your every need according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus.

20. Glory belongs to our God and Father forever and ever! Amen.

21. Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send their greetings to you.

22. All the saints, especially those of the emperor's household, greet you.

23. May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit! Amen.
