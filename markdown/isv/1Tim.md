# 1 Timothy

## 1 Timothy 1

__encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good work and word.__

1. From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and Christ Jesus our hope,

2. to Timothy, my genuine child in the faith. May grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord be yours!

3. When I was on my way to Macedonia, I urged you to stay in Ephesus so that you could instruct certain people to stop teaching false doctrine

4. and occupying themselves with myths and endless genealogies. These things promote controversies rather than God's ongoing purpose, which involves faith.

5. The goal of this instruction is love that flows from a pure heart, from a clear conscience, and from a sincere faith.

6. Some people have left these qualities behind and have turned to fruitless discussion.

7. They want to be teachers of the law, yet they do not understand either what they are talking about or the things about which they speak so confidently.

8. Of course, we know that the law is good if a person uses it legitimately,

9. that is, if he understands that the law is not intended for righteous people but for lawbreakers and rebels, for ungodly people and sinners, for those who are unholy and irreverent, for those who kill their fathers, their mothers, or other people,

10. for those involved in sexual immorality, for homosexuals, for kidnappers, for liars, for false witnesses, and for whatever else goes against the healthy teaching

11. that agrees with the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me.

12. I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who gives me strength, that he has considered me faithful and has appointed me to his service.

13. In the past I was a blasphemer, a persecutor, and a violent man. But I received mercy because I acted ignorantly in my unbelief,

14. and the grace of our Lord overflowed toward me, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.

15. This saying is trustworthy and deserves complete acceptance:	To this world Christ Jesus came,Sinful people to reclaim.I am the worst of them.

16. But for that very reason I received mercy, so that in me, as the worst sinner, Christ Jesus might demonstrate all of his patience as an example for those who would believe in him for eternal life.

17. Now to the King Eternal—the immortal, invisible, and only God—be honor and glory forever and ever! Amen.

18. Timothy, my child, I am giving you this instruction in keeping with the prophecies made earlier about you, so that by following them you may continue to fight the good fight

19. with faith and a good conscience. By ignoring their consciences, some people have destroyed their faith like a wrecked ship.

20. These include Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I handed over to Satan so that they may learn not to blaspheme.

## 1 Timothy 2

1. First of all, then, I urge you to offer petitions, prayers, intercessions, and expressions of thanks for all people,

2. for kings, and for everyone who has authority, so that we might lead a quiet and peaceful life with all godliness and dignity.

3. This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,

4. who wants all people to be saved and to come to a full knowledge of the truth.

5. There is one God. There is also one mediator between God and human beings—a human, Christ Jesus.

6. He gave himself as a ransom for all, a fact that was acknowledged at the right time.

7. For this reason I was appointed to be a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. (I am telling you the truth. I am not lying.)

8. Therefore, I want the men to offer prayers in every place, lifting up holy hands without being angry or argumentative.

9. Women, for their part, should display their beauty by dressing modestly and decently in appropriate clothes, not by braiding their hair or by wearing gold, pearls, or expensive clothes,

10. but through good works. This is proper for women who claim to have reverence for God.

11. A woman must learn quietly with full submission.

12. Moreover, I do not allow a woman to teach or to have authority over a man. Instead, she is to be quiet.

13. For Adam was formed first, then Eve.

14. And it was not Adam who was deceived. It was the woman who was deceived and became a lawbreaker.

15. However, women will be saved by having children, if they continue to have faith, love, and holiness, along with good judgment.

## 1 Timothy 3

1. This saying is trustworthy:	The one who would an elder be,		A noble task desires he.

2. Therefore, an elder must be blameless, the husband of one wife, stable, sensible, respectable, a lover of strangers, and teachable.

3. He must not drink excessively or be a violent person, but instead be gentle. He must not be argumentative or a lover of money.

4. He must manage his own family well and have children who are submissive and respectful in every way.

5. For if a man does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church?

6. He must not be a recent convert, or he might become arrogant and fall into the condemnation of the devil.

7. He must be well thought of by outsiders, lest he fall into disgrace and the trap set for him by the devil.

8. Deacons, too, must be serious. They must not be two-faced, addicted to wine, or greedy for money.

9. They must hold firmly to the secret of the faith with clear consciences.

10. But they must first be tested. Then, if they prove to be blameless, they may become deacons.

11. Their wives must also be serious. They must not be gossips, but instead be stable and trustworthy in everything.

12. Deacons must be husbands of one wife and must manage their children and their families well.

13. Those deacons who serve well gain an excellent reputation for themselves and will have great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.

14. I hope to come to you soon. However, I'm writing this to you

15. in case I am delayed so that you may know how one is to behave in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.

16. By common confession, the secret of our godly worship is great:	In flesh was he revealed to sight,Kept righteous by the Spirit's might,Adored by angels singing.	To nations was he manifest,Believing souls found peace and rest,Our Lord in heaven reigning!

## 1 Timothy 4

1. Now the Spirit says clearly that in the last times some people will abandon the faith by following deceitful spirits, the teachings of demons,

2. and the hypocrisy of liars, whose consciences have been burned by a hot iron.

3. They will try to stop people from marrying and from eating certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.

4. For everything God created is good, and nothing should be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,

5. because it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.

6. If you continue to point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished by the words of the faith and the healthy teaching that you have followed closely.

7. Do not have anything to do with godless myths and fables of old women, but train yourself in godliness.

8. Physical exercise is of limited value, but	Godliness is very dear,A pledge of life, both there and here.

9. This saying is trustworthy and deserves complete acceptance.

10. To this end we work hard and struggle, because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, that is, of those who believe.

11. These are the things you must insist on and teach.

12. Do not let anyone look down on you because you are young, but be an example for other believers in your speech, behavior, love, faithfulness, and purity.

13. Until I arrive, concentrate on the public reading of Scripture, on exhorting, and on teaching.

14. Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy, accompanied by the laying on of the elders’ hands.

15. Think on these things. Devote your life to them so that everyone can see your progress.

16. Pay close attention to your life and your teaching. Persevere in these things, for if you do this, you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.

## 1 Timothy 5

1. Never speak harshly to an older man, but appeal to him as if he were your father. Treat younger men like brothers,

2. older women like mothers, and younger women like sisters, with absolutely purity.

3. Honor widows who are really widows.

4. But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to respect their own family by repaying their parents, for this is pleasing in God's sight.

5. A woman who is really a widow and is left all alone has placed her hope in God and devotes herself to petitions and prayers night and day.

6. But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead while she lives.

7. Continue to give these instructions so that they may be blameless.

8. If anyone does not take care of his own relatives, especially his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.

9. A widow may be put on the widows' list if she is at least sixty years old and has been the wife of one husband.

10. She must be well known for her good works as a woman who has raised children, welcomed strangers, washed the saints’ feet, helped the suffering, and devoted herself to doing good in every way.

11. But do not include younger widows on your list. For whenever their natural desires cause them to lose their devotion to Christ, they want to remarry.

12. They receive condemnation because they have set aside their previous pledge.

13. At the same time, they also learn how to be lazy while going from house to house. Not only this, but they even become gossips and keep busy by interfering in other people's lives, saying things they should not say.

14. Therefore, I want younger widows to remarry, have children, manage their homes, and not give the enemy any chance to ridicule them.

15. For some widows have already turned away to follow Satan.

16. If any woman is a believer and has relatives who are widows, she should help them. The church should not be burdened so that it can help those who really are widows.

17. Elders who handle their duties well should be considered worthy of double compensation, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.

18. For the Scripture says, “You must not muzzle an ox while it is treading out grain,” and“A worker deserves his pay.”

19. Do not accept an accusation against an elder unless it is supported by two or three witnesses.

20. As for those who keep on sinning, rebuke them in front of everyone so that the others will also be afraid.

21. In the sight of God, Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels, I solemnly call on you to carry out these instructions without prejudice, doing nothing on the basis of partiality.

22. Do not ordain anyone hastily. Do not participate in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.

23. Stop drinking only water, but use a little wine for your stomach because of your frequent illnesses.

24. The sins of some people are obvious, going ahead of them to judgment. The sins of others follow them there.

25. In the same way, good works are obvious, and those that are not cannot remain hidden.

## 1 Timothy 6

1. All who are under the yoke of slavery should regard their own masters as deserving of the highest respect, so that the name of God and our teaching may not be discredited.

2. Moreover, those who have believing masters should not be disrespectful to them because they are fellow believers. Instead, they must serve them even better, because those who benefit from their service are believers and dear to them. These are the things you must teach and exhort.

3. If anyone teaches false doctrine and refuses to agree with the healthy words of our Lord Jesus Christ and godly teaching,

4. he is a conceited person and does not understand anything. He has an unhealthy craving for arguments and debates. This produces jealousy, rivalry, slander, evil suspicions,

5. and incessant conflict between people who are depraved in mind and deprived of truth. They think that godliness is a way to make a profit.

6. Of course, godliness with contentment does bring a great profit.

7. For we did not bring anything into the world, and surely we cannot take anything out of it.

8. So as long as we have food and clothes, we will be satisfied with these.

9. But people who want to get rich keep toppling into temptation and are trapped by many stupid and harmful desires that plunge them into destruction and ruin.

10. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, in their eagerness to get rich, have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with much pain.

11. But you, man of God, must flee from all these things. Instead, you must pursue righteousness, godliness, faithfulness, love, endurance, and gentleness.

12. Fight the good fight for the faith. Keep your hold on eternal life, to which you were called and about which you gave a good testimony in front of many witnesses.

13. In the sight of God, who gives life to everything, and in the sight of Christ Jesus, who gave a good testimony before Pontius Pilate, I solemnly charge you

14. to keep this command stainless and blameless until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ.

15. At the right time God will make him known. He is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords.

16. He alone has endless life and lives in inaccessible light. No one has ever seen him, nor can anyone see him. Honor and eternal power belong to him! Amen.

17. Tell those who are rich in the present world not to be arrogant and not to place their confidence in anything as uncertain as riches. Instead, let them place their confidence in God, who lavishly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.

18. They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, and to share.

19. By doing this they store up a treasure for themselves that is a good foundation for the future, so that they can take hold of the life that is real.

20. Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the pointless discussions and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge.

21. Although some claim to have it, they have abandoned the faith. May grace be with all of you!
