2. As a lily among thorns,    So is my love among the daughters.  Beloved

14. My dove in the clefts of the rock,    In the hiding places of the mountainside,    Let me see your face.    Let me hear your voice;    For your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.

15. Catch for us the foxes,    The little foxes that spoil the vineyards;    For our vineyards are in blossom.  Beloved

16. My beloved is mine, and I am his.    He browses among the lilies.

17. Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away,    Turn, my beloved,    And be like a roe or a young hart on the mountains of Bether.
