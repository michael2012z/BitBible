## Micah 1

1. The word of Yahweh that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.

2. Hear, you peoples, all of you.    Listen, earth, and all that is therein: And let the Lord Yahweh be witness against you,    The Lord from his holy temple.

3. For, behold, Yahweh comes forth out of his place,    And will come down and tread on the high places of the earth.

4. The mountains melt under him,    And the valleys split apart,    Like wax before the fire,    Like waters that are poured down a steep place.

5. All this is for the disobedience of Jacob,    And for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the disobedience of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the       high places of Judah? aren`t they Jerusalem?

6. Therefore I       will make Samaria as a heap of the field, [and] as places for       planting vineyards; and I will pour down the stones of it into       the valley, and I will uncover the foundations of it.

7. All       her engraved images shall be beaten to pieces, and all her hires       shall be burned with fire, and all her idols will I lay desolate;       for of the hire of a prostitute has she gathered them, and to the       hire of a prostitute shall they return.

8. For this will I       lament and wail; I will go stripped and naked; I will make a       wailing like the jackals, and a lamentation like the ostriches.

9. For her wounds are incurable; for it is come even to Judah;       it reaches to the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.

10. Don`t tell it in Gath, don`t weep at all: at Beth-le-aphrah have       I rolled myself in the dust.

11. Pass away, inhabitant of       Shaphir, in nakedness and shame: the inhabitant of Zaanan hasn`t       come forth; the wailing of Beth-ezel shall take from you the stay       of it.

12. For the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for       good, because evil is come down from Yahweh to the gate of       Jerusalem.

13. Bind the chariot to the swift steed, inhabitant       of Lachish: she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion;       for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.

14. Therefore shall you give a parting gift to Moresheth-gath: the       houses of Achzib shall be a deceitful thing to the kings of       Israel.

15. I will yet bring to you, inhabitant of Mareshah,       him who shall possess you: the glory of Israel shall come even to       Adullam.

16. Make you bald, and cut off your hair for the       children of your delight: enlarge your baldness as the eagle; for       they are gone into captivity from you.

## Micah 2

1. Woe to those who devise iniquity and work evil on their beds!       when the morning is light, they practice it, because it is in the       power of their hand.

2. They covet fields, and seize them; and       houses, and take them away: and they oppress a man and his house,       even a man and his heritage.

3. Therefore thus says Yahweh:       Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which you       shall not remove your necks, neither shall you walk haughtily;       for it is an evil time.

4. In that day shall they take up a       parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, [and]       say, We are utterly ruined: he changes the portion of my people:       how does he remove [it] from me! to the rebellious he divides our       fields.

5. Therefore you shall have none who shall cast the       line by lot in the assembly of Yahweh.

6. Don`t you prophesy,       [thus] they prophesy. They shall not prophesy to these:       reproaches shall not depart.

7. Shall it be said, O house of       Jacob, Is the Spirit of Yahweh straitened? are these his doings?       Do not my words do good to him who walks blamelessly?

8. But       of late my people is risen up as an enemy: you strip the robe       from off the garment from those who pass by securely [as men]       returned from war.

9. The women of my people you cast out from       their pleasant houses; from their young children you take away my       glory forever.

10. Arise you, and depart; for this is not your       resting-place; because of uncleanness that destroys, even with a       grievous destruction.

11. If a man walking in a spirit of       falsehood do lie, [saying], I will prophesy to you of wine and of       strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.

12. I will surely assemble, Jacob, all of you; I will surely gather       the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of       Bozrah, as a flock in the midst of their pasture; they shall make       great noise by reason of [the multitude of] men.

13. The       breaker is gone up before them: they have broken forth and passed       on to the gate, and are gone out thereat; and their king is       passed on before them, and Yahweh at the head of them.

## Micah 3

1. I said, Please hear, you heads of Jacob, and rulers of the house       of Israel: is it not for you to know justice?

2. you who hate       the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off       them, and their flesh from off their bones;

3. who also eat       the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and       break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and       as flesh within the caldron.

4. Then shall they cry to Yahweh,       but he will not answer them; yes, he will hide his face from them       at that time, according as they have worked evil in their doings.

5. Thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets who make my people       to err; who bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and whoever       doesn`t put into their mouths, they even prepare war against him:

6. Therefore it shall be night to you, that you shall have no       vision; and it shall be dark to you, that you shall not divine;       and the sun shall go down on the prophets, and the day shall be       black over them.

7. The seers shall be put to shame, and the       diviners confounded; yes, they shall all cover their lips; for       there is no answer of God.

8. But as for me, I am full of       power by the Spirit of Yahweh, and of judgment, and of might, to       declare to Jacob his disobedience, and to Israel his sin.

9. Please hear this you heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of       the house of Israel, who abhor justice, and pervert all equity.

10. They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with       iniquity.

11. The heads of it judge for reward, and the       priests of it teach for hire, and the prophets of it divine for       money: yet they lean on Yahweh, and say, Is not Yahweh in the       midst of us? no evil shall come on us.

12. Therefore shall       Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall       become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of       a forest.

## Micah 4

1. But in the latter days it shall happen that the mountain of       Yahweh`s house shall be established on the top of the mountains,       and it shall be exalted above the hills; and peoples shall flow       to it.

2. Many nations shall go and say, Come you, and let us       go up to the mountain of Yahweh, and to the house of the God of       Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his       paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of       Yahweh from Jerusalem;

3. and he will judge between many       peoples, and will decide concerning strong nations afar off: and       they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears       into pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against       nation, neither shall they learn war any more.

4. But they       shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; and       none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of Yahweh of Hosts has       spoken it.

5. For all the peoples walk everyone in the name of       his god; and we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever       and ever.

6. In that day, says Yahweh, will I assemble that       which is lame, and I will gather that which is driven away, and       that which I have afflicted;

7. and I will make that which was       lame a remnant, and that which was cast far off a strong nation:       and Yahweh will reign over them on Mount Zion from henceforth       even forever.

8. You, tower of the flock, the hill of the       daughter of Zion, to you shall it come, yes, the former dominion       shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.

9. Now       why do you cry out aloud? Is there no king in you, is your       counselor perished, that pangs have taken hold of you as of a       woman in travail?

10. Be in pain, and labor to bring forth,       daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now shall you go       forth out of the city, and shall dwell in the field, and shall       come even to Babylon: there shall you be rescued; there will       Yahweh redeem you from the hand of your enemies.

11. Now many       nations are assembled against you, that say, Let her be defiled,       and let our eye see [our desire] on Zion.

12. But they don`t       know the thoughts of Yahweh, neither understand they his counsel;       for he has gathered them as the sheaves to the threshing floor.

13. Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion; for I will make your       horn iron, and I will make your hoofs brass; and you shall beat       in pieces many peoples: and I will devote their gain to Yahweh,       and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.

## Micah 5

1. Now shall you gather yourself in troops, daughter of troops: he       has laid siege against us; they shall strike the judge of Israel       with a rod on the cheek.

2. But you, Beth-lehem Ephrathah,       which are little to be among the thousands of Judah, out of you       shall one come forth to me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose       goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.

3. Therefore       will he give them up, until the time that she who travails has       brought forth: then the residue of his brothers shall return to       the children of Israel.

4. He shall stand, and shall feed [his       flock] in the strength of Yahweh, in the majesty of the name of       Yahweh his God: and they shall abide; for now shall he be great       to the ends of the earth.

5. This [man] shall be [our] peace.       When the Assyrian shall come into our land, and when he shall       tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven       shepherds, and eight principal men.

6. They shall waste the       land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the       entrances of it: and he shall deliver us from the Assyrian, when       he comes into our land, and when he treads within our border.

7. The remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples       as dew from Yahweh, as showers on the grass, that don`t wait for       man, nor wait for the sons of men.

8. The remnant of Jacob       shall be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, as a       lion among the animals of the forest, as a young lion among the       flocks of sheep; who, if he go through, treads down and tears in       pieces, and there is none to deliver.

9. Let your hand be       lifted up above your adversaries, and let all your enemies be cut       off.

10. It shall happen in that day, says Yahweh, that I will       cut off your horses out of the midst of you, and will destroy       your chariots:

11. and I will cut off the cities of your land,       and will throw down all your strongholds.

12. I will cut off       witchcraft out of your hand; and you shall have no [more]       soothsayers:

13. and I will cut off your engraved images and       your pillars out of the midst of you; and you shall no more       worship the work of your hands;

14. and I will pluck up your       Asherim out of the midst of you; and I will destroy your cities.

15. I will execute vengeance in anger and wrath on the nations       which didn`t listen.

## Micah 6

1. Hear you now what Yahweh says: Arise, contend you before the       mountains, and let the hills hear your voice.

2. Hear, you       mountains, Yahweh`s controversy, and you enduring foundations of       the earth; for Yahweh has a controversy with his people, and he       will contend with Israel.

3. My people, what have I done to       you? and in which have I wearied you? testify against me.

4. For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you       out of the house of bondage; and I sent before you Moses, Aaron,       and Miriam.

5. My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab       devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; [remember]       from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous acts of       Yahweh.

6. How shall I come before Yahweh, and bow myself       before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt       offerings, with calves a year old?

7. Will Yahweh be pleased       with thousands of rams, [or] with ten thousands of rivers of oil?       Shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience, the fruit of my       body for the sin of my soul?

8. He has showed you, man, what       is good; and what does Yahweh require of you, but to do justly,       and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?

9. The       voice of Yahweh cries to the city, and [the man of] wisdom will       see your name: hear you the rod, and who has appointed it.

10. Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked,       and a scant measure that is abominable?

11. Shall I be pure       with wicked balances, and with a bag of deceitful weights?

12. For the rich men of it are full of violence, and the inhabitants       of it have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their       mouth.

13. Therefore I also have struck you with a grievous       wound; I have made you desolate because of your sins.

14. You       shall eat, but not be satisfied; and your humiliation shall be in       the midst of you: and you shall put away, but shall not save; and       that which you save will I give up to the sword.

15. You shall       sow, but shall not reap; you shall tread the olives, but shall       not anoint you with oil; and the vintage, but shall not drink the       wine.

16. For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works       of the house of Ahab, and you walk in their counsels; that I may       make you a desolation, and the inhabitants of it a hissing: and       you shall bear the reproach of my people.

## Micah 7

1. Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer       fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no       cluster to eat; my soul desires the first-ripe fig.

2. The       godly man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright       among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man       his brother with a net.

3. Their hands are on that which is       evil to do it diligently; the prince asks, and the judge [is       ready] for a reward; and the great man, he utters the evil desire       of his soul: thus they weave it together.

4. The best of them       is as a brier; the most upright is [worse] than a thorn hedge:       the day of your watchmen, even your visitation, is come; now       shall be their perplexity.

5. Don`t you trust in a neighbor;       don`t you put confidence in a friend; keep the doors of your       mouth from her who lies in your bosom.

6. For the son       dishonors the father, the daughter rises up against her mother,       the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man`s enemies       are the men of his own house.

7. But as for me, I will look to       Yahweh; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear       me.

8. Don`t rejoice against me, my enemy: when I fall, I       shall arise; when I sit in darkness, Yahweh will be a light to       me.

9. I will bear the indignation of Yahweh, because I have       sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment       for me: he will bring me forth to the light, [and] I shall see       his righteousness.

10. Then my enemy shall see it, and shame       shall cover her who said to me, Where is Yahweh your God? My eyes       shall see [my desire] on her; now shall she be trodden down as       the mire of the streets.

11. A day for building your walls! in       that day shall the decree be far removed.

12. In that day       shall they come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and       from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and [from]       mountain to mountain.

13. Yet shall the land be desolate       because of those who dwell therein, for the fruit of their       doings.

14. Feed your people with your rod, the flock of your       heritage, which dwell solitarily, in the forest in the midst of       Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of       old.

15. As in the days of your coming forth out of the land       of Egypt will I show to them marvelous things.

16. The nations       shall see and be ashamed of all their might; they shall lay their       hand on their mouth; their ears shall be deaf.

17. They shall       lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth       they shall come trembling out of their close places; they shall       come with fear to Yahweh our God, and shall be afraid because of       you.

18. Who is a God like you, that pardons iniquity, and       passes over the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage? he       doesn`t retain his anger forever, because he delights in       lovingkindness.

19. He will again have compassion on us; he       will tread our iniquities under foot; and you will cast all their       sins into the depths of the sea.

20. You will perform the       truth to Jacob, [and] the lovingkindness to Abraham, which you       have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.
