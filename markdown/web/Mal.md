# Malachi

## Malachi 1

1. The burden of the word of Yahweh to Israel by Malachi.

2. I have loved you, says Yahweh. Yet you say, Wherein have you loved us? Was not Esau Jacob`s brother, says Yahweh: yet I loved Jacob;

3. but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and [gave] his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.

4. Whereas Edom says, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places; thus says Yahweh of Hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and men shall call them The border of wickedness, and The people against whom Yahweh has indignation forever.

5. Your eyes shall see, and you shall say, Yahweh be magnified beyond the border of Israel.

6. A son honors his father, and a servant his master: if then I am a father, where is my honor? and if I am a master, where is my fear? says Yahweh of Hosts to you, priests, who despise my name. You say, Wherein have we despised your name?

7. You offer polluted bread on my altar. You say, Wherein have we polluted you? In that you say, The table of Yahweh is contemptible.

8. When you offer the blind for sacrifice, it is no evil! and when you offer the lame and sick, it is no evil! Present it now to your governor; will he be pleased with you? or will he accept your person? says Yahweh of Hosts.

9. Now, please entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us: this has been by your means: will he accept any of your persons? says Yahweh of Hosts.

10. Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle [fire on] my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, says Yahweh of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.

11. For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same my name [shall be] great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense [shall be] offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name [shall be] great among the Gentiles, says Yahweh of Hosts.

12. But you profane it, in that you say, The table of Yahweh is polluted, and the fruit of it, even its food, is contemptible.

13. You say also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and you have snuffed at it, says Yahweh of Hosts; and you have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus you bring the offering: should I accept this at your hand? says Yahweh.

14. But cursed be the deceiver, who has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King, says Yahweh of hosts, and my name is awesome among the Gentiles.

## Malachi 2

1. Now, you priests, this commandment is for you.

2. If you will not hear, and if you will not lay it to heart, to give glory to my name, says Yahweh of Hosts, then will I send the curse on you, and I will curse your blessings; yes, I have cursed them already, because you do not lay it to heart.

3. Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and will spread dung on your faces, even the dung of your feasts; and you shall be taken away with it.

4. You shall know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my covenant may be with Levi, says Yahweh of Hosts.

5. My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him who he might fear; and he feared me, and stood in awe of my name.

6. The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity.

7. For the priest`s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of Yahweh of Hosts.

8. But you are turned aside out of the way; you have caused many to stumble in the law; you have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says Yahweh of Hosts.

9. Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as you have not kept my ways, but have had respect of persons in the law.

10. Don`t we all have one father? has not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?

11. Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Yahweh which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.

12. Yahweh will cut off, to the man who does this, him who wakes and him who answers, out of the tents of Jacob, and him who offers an offering to Yahweh of Hosts.

13. This again you do: you cover the altar of Yahweh with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, because he doesn`t regard the offering any more, neither receives it with good will at your hand.

14. Yet you say, Why? Because Yahweh has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously, though she is your companion, and the wife of your covenant.

15. Did he not make one, although he had the residue of the Spirit? Why one? He sought a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.

16. For I hate putting away, says Yahweh, the God of Israel, and him who covers his garment with violence, says Yahweh of Hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that you don`t deal treacherously.

17. You have wearied Yahweh with your words. Yet you say, Wherein have we wearied him? In that you say, Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of Yahweh, and he delights in them; or where is the God of justice?

## Malachi 3

1. Behold, I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, behold, he comes, says Yahweh of hosts.

2. But who can abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appears? for he is like a refiner`s fire, and like fuller`s soap:

3. and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver; and they shall offer to Yahweh offerings in righteousness.

4. Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant to Yahweh, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.

5. I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the perjurers, and against those who oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and who turn aside the sojourner [from his right], and don`t fear me, says Yahweh of Hosts.

6. For I, Yahweh, don`t change; therefore you, sons of Jacob, are not consumed.

7. From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my ordinances, and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, says Yahweh of Hosts. But you say, Wherein shall we return?

8. Will a man rob God? yet you rob me. But you say, Wherein have we robbed you? In tithes and offerings.

9. You are cursed with the curse; for you rob me, even this whole nation.

10. Bring the whole tithe into the store-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, says Yahweh of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough [to receive it].

11. I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field, says Yahweh of Hosts.

12. All nations shall call you happy; for you shall be a delightful land, says Yahweh of Hosts.

13. Your words have been stout against me, says Yahweh. Yet you say, What have we spoken against you?

14. You have said, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept his charge, and that we have walked mournfully before Yahweh of Hosts?

15. Now we call the proud happy; yes, those who work wickedness are built up; yes, they tempt God, and escape.

16. Then those who feared Yahweh spoke one with another; and Yahweh listened, and heard, and a book of memory was written before him, for those who feared Yahweh, and that thought on his name.

17. They shall be my, says Yahweh of Hosts, [even] my own possession, in the day that I make; and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son who serves him.

18. Then shall you return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him who serves God and him who doesn`t serve him.

## Malachi 4

1. For, behold, the day comes, it burns as a furnace; and all the proud, and all who work wickedness, shall be stubble; and the day that comes shall burn them up, says Yahweh of Hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.

2. But to you who fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings; and you shall go forth, and gambol as calves of the stall.

3. You shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make, says Yahweh of Hosts.

4. Remember you the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances.

5. Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of Yahweh come.

6. He shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers; lest I come and strike the earth with a curse.
